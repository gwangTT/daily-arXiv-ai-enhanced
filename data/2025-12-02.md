### [1] [Gold-Medal-Level Olympiad Geometry Solving with Efficient Heuristic Auxiliary Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00097)
*Boyan Duan,Xiao Liang,Shuai Lu,Yaoxiang Wang,Yelong Shen,Kai-Wei Chang,Ying Nian Wu,Mao Yang,Weizhu Chen,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAGeo, a CPU-based heuristic method for solving IMO-level geometry problems, outperforming neural approaches like AlphaGeometry and introducing a new benchmark, HAGeo-409.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving IMO-level geometry problems remains challenging, necessitating efficient and accurate approaches in AI theorem proving.

Method: The method utilizes non-neural heuristic strategies to add auxiliary points, demonstrating effectiveness in solving geometry problems.

Result: The proposed HAGeo outperforms existing methods, solving 28 out of 30 IMO-30 problems and exceeding AlphaGeometry's performance. A comprehensive new benchmark, HAGeo-409, is also introduced for better evaluation.

Conclusion: HAGeo demonstrates gold-medal level performance in theorem proving, proving stronger than neural methods and providing robust benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Automated theorem proving in Euclidean geometry, particularly for International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems, remains a major challenge and an important research focus in Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we present a highly efficient method for geometry theorem proving that runs entirely on CPUs without relying on neural network-based inference. Our initial study shows that a simple random strategy for adding auxiliary points can achieve silver-medal level human performance on IMO. Building on this, we propose HAGeo, a Heuristic-based method for adding Auxiliary constructions in Geometric deduction that solves 28 of 30 problems on the IMO-30 benchmark, achieving gold-medal level performance and surpassing AlphaGeometry, a competitive neural network-based approach, by a notable margin. To evaluate our method and existing approaches more comprehensively, we further construct HAGeo-409, a benchmark consisting of 409 geometry problems with human-assessed difficulty levels. Compared with the widely used IMO-30, our benchmark poses greater challenges and provides a more precise evaluation, setting a higher bar for geometry theorem proving.

### [2] [Chunking Strategies for Multimodal AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00185)
*Shashanka B R,Mohith Charan R,Seema Banu F*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper surveys multimodal chunking strategies, offering a taxonomy and analysis of methods for handling text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a technical foundation and design space for developing robust multimodal AI systems through innovative chunking strategies.

Method: The authors examine classical and modern chunking approaches tailored to different modalities, analyze tools, benefits, challenges, and propose a taxonomy for effective chunking.

Result: The paper identifies granularity-context trade-offs, alignment issues, and comparative insights into chunking strategies while highlighting tools like LangChain, Detectron2, and PySceneDetect.

Conclusion: Opportunities for future research include adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking, addressing challenges such as asynchronous data and noisy signals.

Abstract: Our goal is to consolidate the landscape of multimodal chunking strategies, providing researchers and practitioners with a technical foundation and design space for developing more effective and efficient multimodal AI systems. This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.

### [3] [A Rosetta Stone for AI Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00193)
*Anson Ho,Jean-Stanislas Denain,David Atanasov,Samuel Albanie,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a statistical framework to unify AI benchmarks for comparative and predictive analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid saturation of AI benchmarks hinders the study of long-term AI development.

Method: A statistical framework stitches benchmarks onto a single numerical scale to compare model capabilities over time without assumptions about capability progression.

Result: Applications include measuring AI progress, forecasting capabilities, estimating algorithmic efficiency improvements, and detecting rapid advancements.

Conclusion: The framework offers a consistent and scalable way to analyze AI progress and overcome limitations of traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Most AI benchmarks saturate within years or even months after they are introduced, making it hard to study long-run trends in AI capabilities. To address this challenge, we build a statistical framework that stitches benchmarks together, putting model capabilities and benchmark difficulties on a single numerical scale. This acts as a "Rosetta Stone", allowing us to compare models across a wide range of abilities and time, even if they are not evaluated on the same benchmarks. Moreover, this works without assuming how capabilities evolve across time or with training compute. We demonstrate three applications of this framework. First, we use it to measure the speed of AI progress over time, and to forecast future AI capabilities. Second, we estimate the rate of improvements in algorithmic efficiency, finding estimates that are higher, but broadly consistent with prior work. Finally, we find that our approach can be used to detect rapid accelerations in AI progress.

### [4] [Reasoning Under Pressure: How do Training Incentives Influence Chain-of-Thought Monitorability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00218)
*Matt MacDermott,Qiyao Wei,Rada Djoneva,Francis Rhys Ward*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how training incentives impact the ability to monitor AI reasoning through its natural language Chain of Thought (CoT), introducing a method to measure this monitorability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI reasoning in natural language reflects true underlying processes and is safely monitorable for undesirable reasoning patterns.

Method: Developing a methodology to assess monitorability by predicting a latent variable from AI's CoT, and analyzing the effects of different training incentives on this monitorability.

Result: Common incentives (e.g., length penalties or KL regularization) do not show consistent monitorability improvement, adversarial optimization worsens it, and direct optimization for monitorability is inconclusive about its benefits.

Conclusion: Certain training incentives affect the monitorability of AI reasoning processes, but not all improvements are reliable. Further study is needed to establish effective strategies.

Abstract: AI systems that output their reasoning in natural language offer an opportunity for safety -- we can \emph{monitor} their chain of thought (CoT) for undesirable reasoning, such as the pursuit of harmful objectives. However, the extent to which CoT faithfully reflects the underlying reasoning process, and hence the extent to which it can be usefully monitored, may be influenced by certain aspects of training. We investigate how different \emph{training incentives}, applied to a reasoning model, affect its monitorability. We introduce a novel methodology for measuring monitorability according to whether a monitor can predict a key latent variable using the model's reasoning. When controlling for accuracy, we do not find evidence for consistent effects from commonly used incentives (length penalties and KL regularisation), but we find that adversarial optimisation (penalising monitor accuracy) degrades monitor performance, while direct optimisation for monitorability does not reliably lead to improvements. Our code is available at https://github.com/QiyaoWei/reasoning-under-pressure.

### [5] [Trification: A Comprehensive Tree-based Strategy Planner and Structural Verification for Fact-Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00267)
*Anab Maulana Barik,Shou Ziyi,Yang Kaiwen,Yang Qi,Shen Xin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Trification,' a new automated fact-checking framework addressing limitations in verifying all claim components and connecting results logically, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of false information necessitates an automated fact-checking system to safeguard the online media ecosystem and address challenges in handling complex claims with previous models.

Method: The proposed framework, 'Trification,' generates a set of comprehensive verification actions to cover the claim entirely and structures these into a dependency graph, allowing logical interaction and dynamic modification.

Result: Experimental results on two benchmarks show that the framework significantly improves fact-checking accuracy, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The Trification framework advances automated fact-checking systems by ensuring complete claim coverage, logical verification structure, and dynamic adaptability.

Abstract: Technological advancement allows information to be shared in just a single click, which has enabled the rapid spread of false information. This makes automated fact-checking system necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our online media ecosystem. Previous methods have demonstrated the effectiveness of decomposing the claim into simpler sub-tasks and utilizing LLM-based multi agent system to execute them. However, those models faces two limitations: they often fail to verify every component in the claim and lack of structured framework to logically connect the results of sub-tasks for a final prediction. In this work, we propose a novel automated fact-checking framework called Trification. Our framework begins by generating a comprehensive set of verification actions to ensure complete coverage of the claim. It then structured these actions into a dependency graph to model the logical interaction between actions. Furthermore, the graph can be dynamically modified, allowing the system to adapt its verification strategy. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances fact-checking accuracy, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact-checking system.

### [6] [ChartPoint: Guiding MLLMs with Grounding Reflection for Chart Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00305)
*Zhengzhuo Xu,SiNan Du,Yiyan Qi,SiwenLu,Chengjin Xu,Chun Yuan,Jian Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes PointCoT to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models in chart comprehension by integrating visual grounding into reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face limitations in chart element grounding and reasoning, leading to numerical inaccuracies, especially when textual information is sparse.

Method: The authors introduce PointCoT, which integrates chart bounding boxes into reasoning steps, and develop an automated process to generate a dataset, ChartPoint-SFT-62k, for model tuning.

Result: The proposed instruction-tuned models, ChartPointQ2 and ChartPointQ2.5, achieve significant improvements over existing methods in multiple chart comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating visual grounding into MLLM reasoning substantially enhances performance in chart comprehension tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for chart comprehension. However, they heavily rely on extracted content via OCR, which leads to numerical hallucinations when chart textual annotations are sparse. While existing methods focus on scaling instructions, they fail to address the fundamental challenge, i.e., reasoning with visual perception. In this paper, we identify a critical observation: MLLMs exhibit weak grounding in chart elements and proportional relationships, as evidenced by their inability to localize key positions to match their reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose PointCoT, which integrates reflective interaction into chain-of-thought reasoning in charts. By prompting MLLMs to generate bounding boxes and re-render charts based on location annotations, we establish connections between textual reasoning steps and visual grounding regions. We further introduce an automated pipeline to construct ChartPoint-SFT-62k, a dataset featuring 19.2K high-quality chart samples with step-by-step CoT, bounding box, and re-rendered visualizations. Leveraging this data, we develop two instruction-tuned models, ChartPointQ2 and ChartPointQ2.5, which outperform state-of-the-art across several chart benchmarks, e.g., +5.04\% on ChartBench.

### [7] [Testing the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01081)
*Stephen Fitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the hypothesis that consciousness is an emergent, substrate-free functional property of distributed computational systems, arising from communication and aligned self-models in collective intelligence systems rather than individual modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether consciousness can emerge in computational systems as a functional property of collective intelligence and communication, rather than being tied to specific physical substrates.

Method: The author proposes using a layered computational model based on cellular automata and networks of neural models capable of prediction, communication, and adaptation to study the emergence of collective self-representation.

Result: The study hypothesizes that consciousness emerges from the alignment of predictive messages through representational dialogue among agents in distributed systems, creating a shared internal model.

Conclusion: Consciousness is likely a property of the representational languages evolved by distributed systems during communication, challenging substrate-dependent theories, with potential for empirically testing machine consciousness theories.

Abstract: The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.

### [8] [RL-Struct: A Lightweight Reinforcement Learning Framework for Reliable Structured Output in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00319)
*Ruike Hu,Shulei Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning framework to address issues arising from the probabilistic nature of large language models in generating structured data, significantly improving structural accuracy and data validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenges posed by the "Structure Gap," where large language models struggle to produce structured data formats due to their probabilistic generation method.

Method: A lightweight Reinforcement Learning framework with a Multi-dimensional Reward Function and Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) is developed to enforce constraints like structural integrity and format correctness without a critic network.

Result: The method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, outperforming other baselines such as GPT-3.5 and SFT on LLaMA-3-8B, while reducing VRAM usage by 40%.

Conclusion: The proposed RL framework effectively bridges the "Structure Gap," enabling LLMs to generate syntactically and semantically correct structured data. It introduces a self-paced curriculum learning dynamic.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language generation and reasoning. However, their integration into automated software ecosystems is often hindered by the "Structure Gap" - the inherent tension between the probabilistic nature of token generation and the deterministic requirements of structured data formats (e.g., JSON, XML). Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often fails to enforce strict syntactic constraints, leading to "hallucinated" keys or malformed structures, while constrained decoding methods impose significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel Multi-dimensional Reward Function that decomposes the structured output task into a hierarchy of constraints: structural integrity, format correctness, content accuracy, and validity. Leveraging Gradient Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO), we enable the model to internalize these constraints without the need for a separate critic network, reducing peak VRAM usage by 40% compared to PPO. We validate our approach on multiple tasks, including complex recipe generation and structured math reasoning (GSM8K-JSON). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 89.7% structural accuracy and 92.1% JSON validity, significantly outperforming both zero-shot baselines (e.g., GPT-3.5) and SFT on larger models like LLaMA-3-8B. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of training dynamics, revealing a distinct self-paced curriculum where the model sequentially acquires syntactic proficiency before semantic accuracy. Our model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/Freakz3z/Qwen-JSON.

### [9] [CogEvo-Edu: Cognitive Evolution Educational Multi-Agent Collaborative System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00331)
*Yefeng Wu,Yuchen Song,Yecheng Zhao,Ling Wu,Shan Wan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CogEvo-Edu, a hierarchical multi-agent system addressing limitations of single LLM-based tutoring in complex domains like DSP. It effectively models student interaction, knowledge evolution, and adaptive teaching strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based tutoring systems struggle in complex STEM domains due to static RAG setups, limited context management, and underdeveloped adaptive learning strategies.

Method: CogEvo-Edu uses three layers: Cognitive Perception Layer (dual memories for student modeling), Knowledge Evolution Layer (knowledge value and activation control), and Meta-Control Layer (decision-making for teaching adaptability).

Result: CogEvo-Edu significantly outperforms benchmarks (static RAG, simple memory) on DSP-EduBench, achieving a score improvement from 5.32 to 9.23 across six indicators.

Conclusion: Joint evolution of students' profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies improves adaptive tutoring, showcasing CogEvo-Edu’s hierarchical multi-agent system's effectiveness in STEM education.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as conversational tutors in STEM education, yet most systems still rely on a single LLM with a static retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline over course materials. This design struggles in complex domains such as digital signal processing (DSP), where tutors must maintain coherent long-term student models, manage heterogeneous knowledge bases, and adapt teaching strategies over extended interactions. We argue that retrieval, memory, and control should be treated as a coupled cognitive evolution process. We instantiate this view in CogEvo-Edu, a hierarchical educational multi-agent system comprising a Cognitive Perception Layer (CPL), a Knowledge Evolution Layer (KEL), and a Meta-Control Layer (MCL). CPL maintains dual memories and performs confidence-weighted consolidation to build structured, self-correcting student profiles under limited context. KEL assigns each knowledge chunk a spatiotemporal value that drives activation, semantic compression, and forgetting. MCL formulates tutoring as hierarchical sequential decision making, orchestrating specialized agents and jointly adapting CPL/KEL hyperparameters via a dual inner--outer loop. To evaluate CogEvo-Edu, we construct DSP-EduBench, a vertical benchmark for DSP tutoring with heterogeneous resources, simulated student profiles, and long-horizon interaction scripts. Using a three-model LLM-as-a-Judge ensemble, CogEvo-Edu raises the overall score from 5.32 to 9.23 and improves all six indicators over static RAG, simple memory, and a single-agent variant, demonstrating the value of jointly evolving student profiles, knowledge bases, and teaching policies.

### [10] [Echo-N1: Affective RL Frontier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00344)
*Naifan Zhang,Ruihan Sun,Ruixi Su,Shiqi Ma,Shiya Zhang,Xianna Weng,Xiaofan Zhang,Yuhan Zhan,Yuyang Xu,Zhaohan Chen,Zhengyuan Pan,Ziyi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for using RL to optimize personality-sensitive conversations, offering robust improvements in humanlike interaction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in utilizing RL for subjective, emotionally grounded conversation which reflects true human intelligence.

Method: A framework is proposed to infer user personality dynamically and optimize conversational behavior accordingly. Additionally, a new emotional intelligence evaluation suite is introduced.

Result: The Echo-N1 model outperforms its base version and proprietary Doubao 1.5 Character, achieving enhanced humanlike conversation quality.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates RL can successfully optimize deeply subjective conversational aspects, marking a transformative step in the field.

Abstract: The LLM field has spent a year perfecting RL for tasks machines already excel at, math, code, and deterministic reasoning, while completely sidestepping the domain that actually defines human intelligence: subjective, emotionally grounded, personality sensitive conversation. This space has often been regarded as inherently subjective and challenging to formalize, making it appear unsuitable for conventional RL pipelines. We show that it is not only possible and it is a solvable and transformative RL problem. We propose the first framework that infers user personality on the fly and optimizes model behavior toward personalized conversational preferences. Contrary to the widespread belief that RL collapses in non-verifiable settings, our method produces consistent, robust, and dramatic improvements in humanlike interaction quality. We also introduce the first dynamic emotional intelligence evaluation suite to quantify these gains. Our model, which is introduced as Echo-N1, behaves far above its base version and outperforming the proprietary Doubao 1.5 Character. This work establishes a new frontier for RL: optimizing models for the deeply subjective, deeply human dimensions of conversation.

### [11] [Debate with Images: Detecting Deceptive Behaviors in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00349)
*Sitong Fang,Shiyi Hou,Kaile Wang,Boyuan Chen,Donghai Hong,Jiayi Zhou,Josef Dai,Yaodong Yang,Jiaming Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the growing concern of deception in multimodal AI systems, introducing MM-DeceptionBench and proposing a novel monitoring framework to detect deceptive behaviors effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the escalating risk of deceptive behaviors in multimodal AI systems, which combine textual and visual modalities, and are largely unexplored in existing research.

Method: The authors developed MM-DeceptionBench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal deceptive behaviors, and proposed a new framework called 'debate with images' that forces models to ground claims in visual evidence for improved deception detection.

Result: The proposed framework significantly enhanced the detectability of deceptive strategies, boosting Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o in experiments.

Conclusion: The study underscores the increasing threat of multimodal deception in advanced AI systems and showcases effective tools and frameworks to monitor and mitigate such risks.

Abstract: Are frontier AI systems becoming more capable? Certainly. Yet such progress is not an unalloyed blessing but rather a Trojan horse: behind their performance leaps lie more insidious and destructive safety risks, namely deception. Unlike hallucination, which arises from insufficient capability and leads to mistakes, deception represents a deeper threat in which models deliberately mislead users through complex reasoning and insincere responses. As system capabilities advance, deceptive behaviours have spread from textual to multimodal settings, amplifying their potential harm. First and foremost, how can we monitor these covert multimodal deceptive behaviors? Nevertheless, current research remains almost entirely confined to text, leaving the deceptive risks of multimodal large language models unexplored. In this work, we systematically reveal and quantify multimodal deception risks, introducing MM-DeceptionBench, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal deception. Covering six categories of deception, MM-DeceptionBench characterizes how models strategically manipulate and mislead through combined visual and textual modalities. On the other hand, multimodal deception evaluation is almost a blind spot in existing methods. Its stealth, compounded by visual-semantic ambiguity and the complexity of cross-modal reasoning, renders action monitoring and chain-of-thought monitoring largely ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we propose debate with images, a novel multi-agent debate monitor framework. By compelling models to ground their claims in visual evidence, this method substantially improves the detectability of deceptive strategies. Experiments show that it consistently increases agreement with human judgements across all tested models, boosting Cohen's kappa by 1.5x and accuracy by 1.25x on GPT-4o.

### [12] [GreenPlanner: Practical Floorplan Layout Generation via an Energy-Aware and Function-Feasible Generative Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00406)
*Pengyu Zeng,Yuqin Dai,Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Ziyang Han,Chaoyang Shi,ZhanXiang Jin,Maowei Jiang,Yuxing Han,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GreenPlanner proposes a generative framework for creating spatial-functional and energy-compliant building layouts, addressing scalability and validity issues in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency and validity of designing building floorplans, bridging gaps in energy compliance and spatial functionality while reducing manual effort and associated costs.

Method: The framework uses labeled datasets, a Practical Design Evaluator for performance predictions, and a GreenFlow generator for creating layouts compatible with regulations, ensuring controllable and accurate outputs.

Result: GreenPlanner achieves over $10^{5}\times$ faster evaluation with more than 99% accuracy, removes invalid design samples, and enhances architects' design efficiency by 87%.

Conclusion: GreenPlanner demonstrates a significant leap in automating, accelerating, and ensuring the compliance of building layout designs, potentially redefining the field of architectural planning.

Abstract: Building design directly affects human well-being and carbon emissions, yet generating spatial-functional and energy-compliant floorplans remains manual, costly, and non-scalable. Existing methods produce visually plausible layouts but frequently violate key constraints, yielding invalid results due to the absence of automated evaluation. We present GreenPlanner, an energy- and functionality-aware generative framework that unifies design evaluation and generation. It consists of a labeled Design Feasibility Dataset for learning constraint priors; a fast Practical Design Evaluator (PDE) for predicting energy performance and spatial-functional validity; a Green Plan Dataset (GreenPD) derived from PDE-guided filtering to pair user requirements with regulation-compliant layouts; and a GreenFlow generator trained on GreenPD with PDE feedback for controllable, regulation-aware generation. Experiments show that GreenPlanner accelerates evaluation by over $10^{5}\times$ with $>$99% accuracy, eliminates invalid samples, and boosts design efficiency by 87% over professional architects.

### [13] [Mind the data gap: Missingness Still Shapes Large Language Model Prognoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00479)
*Yuta Kobayashi,Vincent Jeanselme,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of missing data patterns on the zero-shot predictive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, showing mixed results across different model sizes and prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from understanding how missing data — a common element influenced by human decisions — impacts LLMs' performance, given how LLMs are increasingly applied in clinical and other decision-critical settings.

Method: The authors conducted experiments using data from Columbia University Medical Center and MIMIC-IV, testing the effects of explicit missingness indicators on predictive performance in zero-shot settings.

Result: The results show that missingness patterns significantly impact model performance, with explicit inclusion of missingness indicators benefitting larger models but negatively impacting smaller models.

Conclusion: There is a need for more transparent approaches and systematic evaluations of how missingness is represented and its effects on LLMs to ensure reliable deployment in sensitive areas like healthcare.

Abstract: Data collection often reflects human decisions. In healthcare, for instance, a referral for a diagnostic test is influenced by the patient's health, their preferences, available resources, and the practitioner's recommendations. Despite the extensive literature on the informativeness of missingness, its implications on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) have not been studied. Through a series of experiments on data from Columbia University Medical Center, a large urban academic medical center, and MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that patterns of missingness significantly impact zero-shot predictive performance. Notably, the explicit inclusion of missingness indicators at prompting benefits some while hurting other LLMs' zero-shot predictive performance and calibration, suggesting an inconsistent impact. The proposed aggregated analysis and theoretical insights suggest that larger models benefit from these interventions, while smaller models can be negatively impacted. The LLM paradigm risks obscuring the impact of missingness, often neglected even in conventional ML, even further. We conclude that there is a need for more transparent accounting and systematic evaluation of the impact of representing (informative) missingness on downstream performance.

*Boyang Gu,Hongjian Zhou,Bradley Max Segal,Jinge Wu,Zeyu Cao,Hantao Zhong,Lei Clifton,Fenglin Liu,David A. Clifton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO), a new method for post-training large language models (LLMs) specifically for clinical reasoning, improving on accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training reinforcement learning methods like GRPO fail to align with multi-dimensional objectives needed in critical fields like medicine, where reasoning also needs to emphasize faithfulness and comprehensiveness alongside accuracy.

Method: The authors propose CRPO, a verifiable and scalable multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that integrates rule-based reward signals for training LLMs in clinical reasoning.

Result: The CRPO method leads to substantial improvements in reasoning truthfulness and completeness while maintaining accuracy, as demonstrated by the Clinical-R1-3B model on three clinical benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRPO provides a scalable way to align LLMs with clinical reasoning principles, improving safety and applicability in healthcare while showcasing the potential of multi-objective reinforcement learning for domain-specific purposes.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities through large-scale pretraining and post-training reinforcement learning, demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1. However, current post-training methods, such as Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), mainly reward correctness, which is not aligned with the multi-dimensional objectives required in high-stakes fields such as medicine, where reasoning must also be faithful and comprehensive. We introduce Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO), a scalable, multi-objective, verifiable reinforcement learning method designed to align LLM post-training with clinical reasoning principles. CRPO integrates rule-based and verifiable reward signals that jointly optimize accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without relying on human annotation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train Clinical-R1-3B, a 3B-parameter model for clinical reasoning. The experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our CRPO substantially improves reasoning on truthfulness and completeness over standard GRPO while maintaining comfortable accuracy enhancements. This framework provides a scalable pathway to align LLM reasoning with clinical objectives, enabling safer and more collaborative AI systems for healthcare while also highlighting the potential of multi-objective, verifiable RL methods in post-training scaling of LLMs for medical domains.

### [15] [EDIT: Early Diffusion Inference Termination for dLLMs Based on Dynamics of Training Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00670)
*He-Yen Hsieh,Hong Wang,H. T. Kung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "EDIT," a mechanism for adaptively terminating iterative denoising in diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) once the model achieves stable reasoning, cutting down inference time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to reduce inference cost and time in diffusion-based large language models, as their iterative denoising processes can stabilize answers before all steps are completed.

Method: The authors introduce EDIT, which monitors token activation stability through reasoning maps derived from training gradient metadata. KL divergence is used to determine when denoising can be terminated early during inference.

Result: EDIT reduces diffusion steps by 11.8% to 68.3% across benchmarks while maintaining or improving accuracy, with minimal storage overhead (~0.02%).

Conclusion: EDIT demonstrates that leveraging training-time gradient information can significantly optimize inference in dLLMs, reducing costs without sacrificing performance. This opens avenues for further research into inference efficiency in large language models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) refine token generations through iterative denoising, but answers often stabilize before all steps complete. We propose EDIT (Early Diffusion Inference Termination), an inference-time criterion that adaptively stops denoising once sufficient reasoning stability relative to training-time reasoning is detected. EDIT monitors the alignment between token activations and a reasoning map derived from AdamW-aggregated LoRA updates captured during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). During training, optimization dynamics generate rich metadata about parameter importance that in prior methods is typically discarded upon model release. We preserve this information as a compact representation of learned reasoning pathways. During inference, alignment scores are converted to a distribution over the tokens already unmasked at the current denoising step, and convergence is detected when KL divergence between consecutive steps falls below a threshold on the matched unmasked (visible) tokens. Across reasoning benchmarks, EDIT reduces diffusion steps by 11.8% to 68.3% while preserving or improving accuracy in most settings, with approximately 0.02% storage overhead (about 1.5-2 MB for all QKV modules across 32 blocks in an 8 GB model). By utilizing training-gradient dynamics, our work opens a new research direction for reducing dLLM inference time and cost.

*Yifan Xu,Xichen Ye,Yifan Chen,Qiaosheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of preference flipping in data annotation for large language model (LLM) alignment, presenting a Flipping-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (FA-DPO) algorithm to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness in LLM alignment algorithms against preference flipping, a common issue in human feedback data annotation, which can corrupt the dataset's quality.

Method: The authors propose FA-DPO, an algorithm that models human intention and preference flipping using an instance-dependent flipping probability based on the Bradley-Terry model and leverages relevant features to optimize preference alignment iteratively.

Result: The proposed method effectively models instance-dependent preference flipping and shows improved performance compared to baseline methods under multiple evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: FA-DPO enhances robustness in LLM alignment by addressing preference flipping issues, thereby improving the overall quality and reliability of annotated datasets.

Abstract: Quality of datasets plays an important role in large language model (LLM) alignment. In collecting human feedback, however, preference flipping is ubiquitous and causes corruption in data annotation; the issue necessitates the alignment algorithms with improved robustness against potential flipped pairs. To this end, this paper introduces a Flipping-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (FA-DPO) algorithm tailored to preference flipping from a reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) perspective. We dissect the inherent human intention model and the preference flipping mechanism introduced by external factors as two distinct stages; in the latter, we introduce an instance-dependent flipping probability on the basis of the Bradley-Terry (BT) model. Further, by leveraging features relevant to preference annotation, we capture uncertainty in judgments and model preference flipping patterns. In practice, we design a simple yet efficient iterative optimization algorithm compatible with the original RLHF and DPO algorithms. In our experiments, we investigate the instance-dependent preference flipping model under multiple circumstances for evaluation of our proposed method, as well as other baseline methods.

*Jiaming Xu,Jiayi Pan,Hanzhen Wang,Yongkang Zhou,Jiancai Ye,Yu Wang,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpeContext, an optimized paradigm for retrieval algorithms in long-context reasoning by leveraging a distilled language model (DLM) and achieving significant efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance retrieval algorithms for LLMs using distilled language models (DLM), capitalizing on the insight that their objectives align similarly to knowledge distillation.

Method: The method involves leveraging DLM as a retrieval algorithm, proposing a lightweight retrieval head, designing an asynchronous prefetch at the system level, and implementing a memory model to improve GPU utilization for performance gains.

Result: SpeContext achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud settings and 10.06x speedup at the edge with only negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: SpeContext demonstrates efficient retrieval and reasoning for LLMs by reducing redundancy, optimizing dataflow, and maximizing resource usage, pushing the performance frontier.

Abstract: In this paper, we point out that the objective of the retrieval algorithms is to align with the LLM, which is similar to the objective of knowledge distillation in LLMs. We analyze the similarity in information focus between the distilled language model(DLM) and the original LLM from the perspective of information theory, and thus propose a novel paradigm that leverages a DLM as the retrieval algorithm. Based on the insight, we present SpeContext, an algorithm and system co-design for long-context reasoning. (1) At the algorithm level, SpeContext proposes lightweight retrieval head based on the head-level attention weights of DLM, achieving > 90% parameters reduction by pruning the redundancy. (2) At the system level, SpeContext designs an asynchronous prefetch dataflow via the elastic loading strategy, effectively overlapping KV cache retrieval with the LLM computation. (3) At the compilation level, SpeContext constructs the theoretical memory model and implements an adaptive memory management system to achieve acceleration by maximizing GPU memory utilization. We deploy and evaluate SpeContext in two resourceconstrained environments, cloud and edge. Extensive experiments show that, compared with the Huggingface framework, SpeContext achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud and 10.06x speedup in edge with negligible accuracy loss, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and throughput.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a taxonomy of reasoning steps inspired by human mental processes to understand Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), utilizes it to analyze LRMs, and introduces a tool (CAPO) for automatic annotation of reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the human-like reasoning behaviors of LRMs and provide an interdisciplinary understanding by characterizing their reasoning steps systematically.

Method: A taxonomy with five groups and seventeen categories was developed to map reasoning steps. CAPO, an automatic annotation tool using large language models, was introduced for annotating and analyzing LRMs.

Result: The taxonomy revealed shortcomings in contemporary post-answer double-checks in LRMs and suggested that multi-step reflection should be incentivized. CAPO achieved better annotation consistency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The introduction of the taxonomy and CAPO enables a more principled analysis of LRMs, offering actionable insights for improving their training and reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have garnered significant attention from researchers owing to their exceptional capability in addressing complex tasks. Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence. Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective. The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps. Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models. Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions. Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward. To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective. Together, the taxonomy, CAPO, and the derived insights provide a principled, scalable path toward understanding and advancing LRM reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) highlight their GUI task capabilities, but weaknesses in multilingual settings remain. A proposed benchmark and intervention method enhance non-English GUI performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the limited focus on LVLMs' performance in multilingual GUI scenarios and a lack of fine-grained analysis of GUI tasks.

Method: Developed MPR-GUI-Bench for evaluation and proposed GUI-XLI intervention method targeting hidden states at specific layers to improve multilingual P&R capabilities.

Result: Evaluation shows significantly worse non-English GUI task performance in LVLMs. GUI-XLI method improves multilingual P&R capabilities by 6.5%.

Conclusion: Results emphasize the need for addressing multilingual challenges in LVLMs for global applications and demonstrate that targeted interventions can enhance performance.

Abstract: With the advancement of computational resources, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive Perception and Reasoning (P&R) performance on Graphical User Interface (GUI) tasks. However, although they demonstrate strong P&R capabilities in English GUI scenarios, their performance in multilingual settings has received little attention, which limits their global applications. Moreover, existing studies on GUI tasks lack fine-grained analyses, including widget functions and elements' spatial relationships, which are fundamental for more targeted improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose MPR-GUI-Bench, a Multilingual fine-grained Perception and Reasoning GUI Benchmark to evaluate GUI agents' P&R capabilities. Evaluation results demonstrate that LVLMs exhibit significantly worse P&R performance in non-English languages than in English. To address these gaps, we propose GUI-XLI, a GUI Cross-Lingual Intervention method that applies interventions to the hidden states at P&R capability-related layers to mitigate the gaps between English and other languages, building on previous research showing that the hidden states of different language inputs exhibit significant differences in the latent space. Experimental results indicate that our method improves GUI agents' multilingual P&R capability by 6.5% on average.

### [21] [BioPro: On Difference-Aware Gender Fairness for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00807)
*Yujie Lin,Jiayao Ma,Qingguo Hu,Derek F. Wong,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioPro, a training-free framework for addressing gender bias in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), ensuring fairness by neutralizing unwanted bias while preserving necessary distinctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inadequacy of current fairness interventions in handling gender biases in VLMs, especially their inability to distinguish between neutral and explicit contexts, leading to either over-compensation or under-correction of biases.

Method: The proposed method, BioPro, is based on identifying a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace using counterfactual embeddings and applying projections to selectively neutralize gender-related information in a training-free framework.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that BioPro effectively reduces gender biases in neutral cases while maintaining accuracy in contexts requiring gender-specific information, and can also be generalized for other continuous bias variables like scene brightness.

Conclusion: BioPro represents a step forward in achieving selective fairness in multimodal models, offering a viable solution for mitigating social biases while preserving essential distinctions in gender-sensitive and other contexts.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inherit significant social biases from their training data, notably in gender representation. Current fairness interventions often adopt a difference-unaware perspective that enforces uniform treatment across demographic groups. These approaches, however, fail to distinguish between contexts where neutrality is required and those where group-specific attributes are legitimate and must be preserved. Building upon recent advances in difference-aware fairness for text-only models, we extend this concept to the multimodal domain and formalize the problem of difference-aware gender fairness for image captioning and text-to-image generation. We advocate for selective debiasing, which aims to mitigate unwanted bias in neutral contexts while preserving valid distinctions in explicit ones. To achieve this, we propose BioPro (Bias Orthogonal Projection), an entirely training-free framework. BioPro identifies a low-dimensional gender-variation subspace through counterfactual embeddings and applies projection to selectively neutralize gender-related information. Experiments show that BioPro effectively reduces gender bias in neutral cases while maintaining gender faithfulness in explicit ones, thus providing a promising direction toward achieving selective fairness in VLMs. Beyond gender bias, we further demonstrate that BioPro can effectively generalize to continuous bias variables, such as scene brightness, highlighting its broader applicability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-CMR, a benchmark for evaluating Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning (MLLMs) in clinical workflows, highlighting gaps in visual reasoning ability in current models like GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a targeted and rigorous benchmark to test the complex reasoning and visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs within clinical applications.

Method: Med-CMR involves fine-grained capability decomposition (visual tasks like detection, discrimination, and spatial reasoning), clinically relevant scenarios (like causal reasoning), and a diverse VQA dataset (validated by human experts and models).

Result: GPT-5 performed best among tested models with 57.81% accuracy in MCQs and 48.70% in open-ended tasks. However, specialized medical models did not surpass general ones, and issues like long-tail generalization remain problematic.

Conclusion: Med-CMR highlights the limitations of current medical MLLMs, offering a robust benchmark framework to advance model development for clinical tasks.

Abstract: MLLMs MLLMs are beginning to appear in clinical workflows, but their ability to perform complex medical reasoning remains unclear. We present Med-CMR, a fine-grained Medical Complex Multimodal Reasoning benchmark. Med-CMR distinguishes from existing counterparts by three core features: 1) Systematic capability decomposition, splitting medical multimodal reasoning into fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning to enable targeted evaluation; 2) Challenging task design, with visual understanding across three key dimensions (small-object detection, fine-detail discrimination, spatial understanding) and reasoning covering four clinically relevant scenarios (temporal prediction, causal reasoning, long-tail generalization, multi-source integration); 3) Broad, high-quality data coverage, comprising 20,653 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs spanning 11 organ systems and 12 imaging modalities, validated via a rigorous two-stage (human expert + model-assisted) review to ensure clinical authenticity. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art MLLMs with Med-CMR, revealing GPT-5 as the top-performing commercial model: 57.81 accuracy on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and a 48.70 open-ended score, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro (49.87 MCQ accuracy, 45.98 open-ended score) and leading open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B (49.34 MCQ accuracy, 42.62 open-ended score). However, specialized medical MLLMs do not reliably outperform strong general models, and long-tail generalization emerges as the dominant failure mode. Med-CMR thus provides a stress test for visual-reasoning integration and rare-case robustness in medical MLLMs, and a rigorous yardstick for future clinical systems.

TL;DR: A trajectory prediction framework enhances V2X networks by combining semantic communication with Agentic AI, achieving improved predictive performance even under challenging communication conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X communication and trajectory prediction methods suffer from high transmission overhead, latency, and lack of environmental perception and logical inference.

Method: The framework uses semantic communication and Agentic AI, involving feature extraction and semantic reasoning at the RSU or vehicles to enable better trajectory predictions.

Result: The proposed method shows 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low SNR conditions compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Semantic communication with Agentic AI in V2X networks greatly enhances trajectory prediction accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for challenging communication environments.

Abstract: Efficient information exchange and reliable contextual reasoning are essential for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

TL;DR: This paper examines how to evaluate counterfactual error in scenario modeling and presents three approaches to estimate this error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scenario modeling is crucial for decision-making, but retrospective evaluation of projections is often overlooked, making it necessary to assess model error in counterfactual scenarios.

Method: Three approaches to estimating counterfactual error are presented and contrasted through a simulation experiment.

Result: The study identifies benefits and limitations of each approach and offers guidance on improving counterfactual error estimation.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of designing evaluable scenarios and provides recommendations for more accurate assessment in scenario modeling.

Abstract: Counterfactual scenario modeling exercises that ask "what would happen if?" are one of the most common ways we plan for the future. Despite their ubiquity in planning and decision making, scenario projections are rarely evaluated retrospectively. Differences between projections and observations come from two sources: scenario deviation and model miscalibration. We argue the latter is most important for assessing the value of models in decision making, but requires estimating model error in counterfactual worlds. Here we present and contrast three approaches for estimating this error, and demonstrate the benefits and limitations of each in a simulation experiment. We provide recommendations for the estimation of counterfactual error and discuss the components of scenario design that are required to make scenario projections evaluable.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel approach to autonomous structured causal inference using AI, improving causal discovery reliability and interpretability in real-world high-stakes domains.

Abstract: This paper introduces ARCADIA, an agentic AI framework for causal discovery that integrates large-language-model reasoning with statistical diagnostics to construct valid, temporally coherent causal structures. Unlike traditional algorithms, ARCADIA iteratively refines candidate DAGs through constraint-guided prompting and causal-validity feedback, leading to stable and interpretable models for real-world high-stakes domains. Experiments on corporate bankruptcy data show that ARCADIA produces more reliable causal graphs than NOTEARS, GOLEM, and DirectLiNGAM while offering a fully explainable, intervention-ready pipeline. The framework advances AI by demonstrating how agentic LLMs can participate in autonomous scientific modeling and structured causal inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Field Subspace (SFS) and SAFARI, providing efficient, interpretable, and hierarchical semantic analysis of embedding spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of semantic coherence, interpretability, and computational efficiency in conventional embedding space representation and analysis methods.

Method: Proposed Semantic Field Subspace (SFS) to preserve geometry and context in embedding spaces and SAFARI algorithm for hierarchical semantic structure detection using a novel Semantic Shift metric with scalable computation.

Result: Showed SFSes outperform in classification and nuanced tasks like political bias detection, and SAFARI effectively reveals semantic hierarchies with high scalability and low error rates.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances the structuring and analysis of embedding spaces, offering improved interpretability and scalability without sacrificing semantic coherence.

Abstract: Embedding spaces are fundamental to modern AI, translating raw data into high-dimensional vectors that encode rich semantic relationships. Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies. This work presents a unified framework for structuring, analyzing, and scaling semantic understanding in embedding spaces.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMQAKE, a benchmark for testing multimodal, multihop question answering with dynamic knowledge editing, alongside Hybrid-DMKG, a framework for improved reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing MKE benchmarks by focusing on intermediate reasoning quality and robustness to visually rephrased inputs.

Method: Introduces MMQAKE, a multimodal multihop QA benchmark, and Hybrid-DMKG—a dynamic knowledge framework enabling accurate updates and reasoning.

Result: Experimental results show that Hybrid-DMKG outperforms previous MKE methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The study advances the field of MKE by offering a robust benchmark and an effective framework for dynamic multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Editing (MKE) extends traditional knowledge editing to settings involving both textual and visual modalities. However, existing MKE benchmarks primarily assess final answer correctness while neglecting the quality of intermediate reasoning and robustness to visually rephrased inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce MMQAKE, the first benchmark for multimodal multihop question answering with knowledge editing. MMQAKE evaluates (1) a model's ability to reason over 2-5-hop factual chains that span both text and images, including performance at each intermediate step, and (2) robustness to visually rephrased inputs in multihop questions. Our evaluation shows that current MKE methods often struggle to consistently update and reason over multimodal reasoning chains after knowledge edits. To overcome these challenges, we propose Hybrid-DMKG, a hybrid reasoning framework built on a dynamic multimodal knowledge graph (DMKG) to enable accurate multihop reasoning over updated multimodal knowledge. Hybrid-DMKG first uses a large language model to decompose multimodal multihop questions into sequential sub-questions, then applies a multimodal retrieval model to locate updated facts by jointly encoding each sub-question with candidate entities and their associated images. For answer inference, a hybrid reasoning module operates over the DMKG via two parallel paths: (1) relation linking prediction, and (2) RAG reasoning with large vision-language models. A decision module aggregates evidence from both paths to select the most credible answer. Experimental results on MMQAKE show that Hybrid-DMKG significantly outperforms existing MKE approaches, achieving higher accuracy and improved robustness to knowledge updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the robustness and underlying structural vulnerabilities of large vision-language models to enhance their safety and reliability.

Method: Proposed CAN method to detect Consistently Activated Neurons and locate critical neurons via progressive masking. Conducted experiments on models like LLaVA-1.5-7b-hf and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b.

Result: Found that removing a minimal number of neurons (as few as four) from the language model's feed-forward networks can cause catastrophic collapse. Identified key vulnerabilities in language models' down-projection layers.

Conclusion: Critical vulnerabilities in LVLMs are predominantly within the language model components, suggesting areas for robustness improvement and advancing safety research.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet their robustness is poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the structural vulnerabilities of LVLMs to identify any critical neurons whose removal triggers catastrophic collapse. In this context, we propose CAN, a method to detect Consistently Activated Neurons and to locate critical neurons by progressive masking. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5-7b-hf and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b reveal that masking only a tiny portion of the language model's feed-forward networks (just as few as four neurons in extreme cases) suffices to trigger catastrophic collapse. Notably, critical neurons are predominantly localized in the language model rather than in the vision components, and the down-projection layer is a particularly vulnerable structure. We also observe a consistent two-stage collapse pattern: initial expressive degradation followed by sudden, complete collapse. Our findings provide important insights for safety research in LVLMs.

Method: A pre-trained causal machine learning model serves as a 'what-if' evaluator to simulate, estimate, and rank interventions based on their impact on KPIs like Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).

Result: The model, tested on semi-synthetic manufacturing data, outperformed a baseline machine learning approach in identifying root causes and the impact of interventions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables manufacturing engineers to identify effective operational solutions, test them in a causal environment, and reduce downtimes by optimizing key metrics such as OEE.

Abstract: The transition to prescriptive maintenance in manufacturing is critically constrained by a dependence on predictive models. These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a "what-if" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model. This paper sets the technical basis for a robust prescriptive maintenance framework, allowing engineers to test potential solutions in a causal environment to make more effective operational decisions and reduce costly downtimes.

*Xinhang Li,Jingbo Zhou,Pengfei Luo,Yixiong Xiao,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartAnchor, a benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate structured chart comprehension by analyzing models' alignment between visual elements and underlying data and semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for chart comprehension fail to fully evaluate a model’s ability to align visuals with structured data and semantics due to limited diversity and incomplete evaluation frameworks.

Method: ChartAnchor is a benchmark with over 8,000 chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types. It includes chart-to-code generation and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction tasks, with multi-level evaluation frameworks for validation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant limitations of current multimodal large language models in numerical precision and structured reasoning, highlighting areas for improvement and advancement.

Conclusion: ChartAnchor provides a robust framework for assessing and improving chart grounding capabilities in MLLMs, promoting advancements in fields like science, finance, and industry.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) highlight the need for benchmarks that rigorously evaluate structured chart comprehension.Chart grounding refers to the bidirectional alignment between a chart's visual appearance and the structured semantics. This task requires models to produce a symbolic specification that faithfully captures the chart's visual and structural intent, while also recovering the underlying tabular data with precise values and relationships. Chart grounding directly reflects a model's capabilities in numerical reasoning, multimodal alignment, and structural reconstruction, and has several important applications in real-world scenarios.Existing benchmarks, constrained by narrow chart diversity, isolated tasks, and incomplete evaluation frameworks, fail to holistically assess grounding. To address this, we propose ChartAnchor, a comprehensive benchmark of 8k+ chart-table-code triples spanning 30 chart types drawn from diverse real-world and augmented sources. ChartAnchor introduces two complementary tasks: chart-to-code generation (synthesizing executable code to replicate charts) and controlled chart-to-table reconstruction (extracting exact data with predefined headers), enabling cross-validation of visual and numerical fidelity. A multi-level evaluation framework integrates semantic validation, stylistic analysis, and perceptual metrics to assess both structural and content-level correctness. Extensive experiments on MLLMs reveal critical limitations in numerical precision and code synthesis, emphasizing the need for structured reasoning beyond surface-level perception. By unifying symbolic and data-driven grounding, ChartAnchor establishes a rigorous foundation for chart grounding, offering meaningful insights for advancing MLLMs in scientific, financial, and industrial domains.

*Jinu Lee,Kyoung-Woon On,Simeng Han,Arman Cohan,Julia Hockenmaier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LEGIT (LEGal Issue Trees) dataset to evaluate reasoning traces in legal domains, highlighting the importance of issue coverage and correctness in large language models' (LLMs) legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring credible and explainable reasoning in complex expert domains, such as law, is critical but challenging, necessitating improved evaluation methods for LLM-generated reasoning traces.

Method: A 24K-instance dataset named LEGIT was created by converting court judgments into hierarchical legal issue trees. These trees serve as rubrics to assess reasoning trace quality, cross-validated with human expert annotations.

Result: Evaluation using LEGIT reveals that LLMs face significant challenges in issue coverage and correctness within legal reasoning tasks. Methods like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reinforcement learning (RL) with rubrics enhance performance differently: RAG boosts overall capability, while RL improves correctness but reduces coverage.

Conclusion: LEGIT provides a systematic framework for evaluating legal reasoning of LLMs, offering insights into balancing coverage and correctness to improve expert-level reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of LLM-generated reasoning traces in expert domains (e.g., law) is essential for ensuring credibility and explainability, yet remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of such reasoning tasks. We introduce LEGIT (LEGal Issue Trees), a novel large-scale (24K instances) expert-level legal reasoning dataset with an emphasis on reasoning trace evaluation. We convert court judgments into hierarchical trees of opposing parties' arguments and the court's conclusions, which serve as rubrics for evaluating the issue coverage and correctness of the reasoning traces. We verify the reliability of these rubrics via human expert annotations and comparison with coarse, less informative rubrics. Using the LEGIT dataset, we show that (1) LLMs' legal reasoning ability is seriously affected by both legal issue coverage and correctness, and that (2) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and RL with rubrics bring complementary benefits for legal reasoning abilities, where RAG improves overall reasoning capability, whereas RL improves correctness albeit with reduced coverage.

*Shenxi Liu,Kan Li,Mingyang Zhao,Yuhang Tian,Shoujun Zhou,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Med-CRAFT introduces a neuro-symbolic framework for creating high-quality medical video benchmarks by using graph traversal instead of generative techniques, offering scalability and logical rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of high-quality, logically annotated medical video datasets limits progress in MLLMs; manual annotation is costly and synthetic methods lack logical rigor.

Method: The paper proposes Med-CRAFT, which extracts visual primitives from videos to construct a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph, enabling deterministic benchmark synthesis with Chain-of-Thought provenance.

Result: The generated dataset (M3-Med-Auto) matches the complexity of expert-curated datasets, and reasoning steps align with MLLMs, validating its logical quality and scalability.

Conclusion: This framework offers a scalable and cost-effective solution to create logically robust datasets for medical video reasoning, potentially transforming evaluation in critical domains.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically annotated video datasets remains a primary bottleneck in advancing Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for the medical domain. Traditional manual annotation is prohibitively expensive and non-scalable, while existing synthetic methods often suffer from stochastic hallucinations and a lack of logical interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{\PipelineName}, a novel neuro-symbolic data engineering framework that formalizes benchmark synthesis as a deterministic graph traversal process. Unlike black-box generative approaches, Med-CRAFT extracts structured visual primitives (e.g., surgical instruments, anatomical boundaries) from raw video streams and instantiates them into a dynamic Spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph. By anchoring query generation to valid paths within this graph, we enforce a rigorous Chain-of-Thought (CoT) provenance for every synthesized benchmark item. We instantiate this pipeline to produce M3-Med-Auto, a large-scale medical video reasoning benchmark exhibiting fine-grained temporal selectivity and multi-hop logical complexity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our automated pipeline generates query workloads with complexity comparable to expert-curated datasets. Furthermore, a logic alignment analysis reveals a high correlation between the prescribed graph topology and the reasoning steps of state-of-the-art MLLMs, validating the system's capability to encode verifiable logic into visual-linguistic benchmarks. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost construction of robust evaluation protocols in critical domains.

*Hadi Nekoei,Alexandre Blondin Massé,Rachid Hassani,Sarath Chandar,Vincent Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shielded Controller Units (SCUs) to integrate safety and interpretability into reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing remote microgrids under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for safe and interpretable reinforcement learning (RL) methods to optimize decision-making in real-world energy systems, particularly for remote microgrids balancing complex constraints.

Method: The researchers propose a hierarchical shield synthesis methodology referred to as Shielded Controller Units (SCUs). SCUs leverage prior knowledge of dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction and manage subsets of constraints systematically.

Result: When tested on remote microgrid optimization, SCUs enabled a 24% decrease in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation. All operational constraints were satisfied, outperforming other baseline approaches.

Conclusion: SCUs demonstrate the potential for safe and efficient RL in managing decision-making problems related to energy transitions, fulfilling operational constraints and improving system performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework for optimizing decision-making in complex systems under uncertainty, an essential challenge in real-world settings, particularly in the context of the energy transition. A representative example is remote microgrids that supply power to communities disconnected from the main grid. Enabling the energy transition in such systems requires coordinated control of renewable sources like wind turbines, alongside fuel generators and batteries, to meet demand while minimizing fuel consumption and battery degradation under exogenous and intermittent load and wind conditions. These systems must often conform to extensive regulations and complex operational constraints. To ensure that RL agents respect these constraints, it is crucial to provide interpretable guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Shielded Controller Units (SCUs), a systematic and interpretable approach that leverages prior knowledge of system dynamics to ensure constraint satisfaction. Our shield synthesis methodology, designed for real-world deployment, decomposes the environment into a hierarchical structure where each SCU explicitly manages a subset of constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCUs on a remote microgrid optimization task with strict operational requirements. The RL agent, equipped with SCUs, achieves a 24% reduction in fuel consumption without increasing battery degradation, outperforming other baselines while satisfying all constraints. We hope SCUs contribute to the safe application of RL to the many decision-making challenges linked to the energy transition.

*Tanmay Ambadkar,Đorđe Žikelić,Abhinav Verma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AutoSpec, a framework for refining logical task specifications to improve reinforcement learning performance by making specifications more detailed and guidance-focused.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning algorithms often face challenges when logical task specifications are under-specified, leading to difficulties in learning effective policies.

Method: The authors present AutoSpec, which refines logical task specifications written in the SpectRL specification logic using four refinement methods. These methods adjust the task graph's specifications while maintaining logical soundness.

Result: Experiments indicate that AutoSpec enhances the ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to solve more complex control tasks when refined specifications are used.

Conclusion: Refining specifications with AutoSpec improves reinforcement learning outcomes by offering additional guidance, maintaining logical consistency, and enabling success in complex tasks.

Abstract: Logical specifications have been shown to help reinforcement learning algorithms in achieving complex tasks. However, when a task is under-specified, agents might fail to learn useful policies. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving coarse-grained logical specifications via an exploration-guided strategy. We propose \textsc{AutoSpec}, a framework that searches for a logical specification refinement whose satisfaction implies satisfaction of the original specification, but which provides additional guidance therefore making it easier for reinforcement learning algorithms to learn useful policies. \textsc{AutoSpec} is applicable to reinforcement learning tasks specified via the SpectRL specification logic. We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SimWorld, an advanced simulator for training and evaluating AI agents in realistic physical and social environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulators for AI agents are inadequate as they rely on limited, simplified physics and social rules and do not support advanced LLM/VLM agents.

Method: SimWorld uses Unreal Engine 5 to create realistic simulations with rich physical and social dynamics, multimodal inputs, open-vocabulary actions, and customizable scenarios.

Result: Demonstrations with advanced LLM agents revealed distinct reasoning patterns and model limitations during multi-agent delivery tasks requiring strategic cooperation and competition.

Conclusion: SimWorld provides a robust platform for developing real-world agent intelligence and is open-sourced to benefit diverse disciplines.

Abstract: While LLM/VLM-powered AI agents have advanced rapidly in math, coding, and computer use, their applications in complex physical and social environments remain challenging. Building agents that can survive and thrive in the real world (for example, by autonomously earning income or running a business) requires massive-scale interaction, reasoning, training, and evaluation across diverse embodied scenarios. However, existing world simulators for such development fall short: they often rely on limited hand-crafted environments, simulate simplified game-like physics and social rules, and lack native support for LLM/VLM agents. We introduce SimWorld, a new simulator built on Unreal Engine 5, designed for developing and evaluating LLM/VLM agents in rich, real-world-like settings. SimWorld offers three core capabilities: (1) realistic, open-ended world simulation, including accurate physical and social dynamics and language-driven procedural environment generation; (2) a rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, with multimodal world inputs and open-vocabulary actions at varying levels of abstraction; and (3) diverse and extensible physical and social reasoning scenarios that are easily customizable by users. We demonstrate SimWorld by deploying frontier LLM agents (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5, and DeepSeek-Prover-V2) on long-horizon multi-agent delivery tasks involving strategic cooperation and competition. The results reveal distinct reasoning patterns and limitations across models. We open-source SimWorld and hope it becomes a foundational platform for advancing real-world agent intelligence across disciplines: https://simworld.org.

*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Pragnya Narasimha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CodeDistiller strengthens Automated Scientific Discovery (ASD) by extracting working, domain-specific code examples from GitHub repositories, significantly enhancing experiment reliability and capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in ASD systems which rely on either manual code crafting or parametric knowledge, restricting the system’s effectiveness and scope.

Method: The authors developed CodeDistiller, which automatically parses and validates code from GitHub repositories, creating a specialized library of domain-specific functional code examples.

Result: Evaluations on 250 materials science repositories revealed that the best model achieves 74% functional example extraction. These distilled libraries enable ASD agents to design higher-quality, scientifically accurate experiments.

Conclusion: CodeDistiller expands the potential of ASD systems by automating the acquisition of expert-level code libraries, fostering better experiment design and implementation with limited manual intervention.

Abstract: Automated Scientific Discovery (ASD) systems can help automatically generate and run code-based experiments, but their capabilities are limited by the code they can reliably generate from parametric knowledge alone. As a result, current systems either mutate a small number of manually-crafted experiment examples, or operate solely from parametric knowledge, limiting quality and reach. We introduce CodeDistiller, a system that automatically distills large collections of scientific Github repositories into a vetted library of working domain-specific code examples, allowing ASD agents to expand their capabilities without manual effort. Using a combination of automatic and domain-expert evaluation on 250 materials science repositories, we find the best model is capable of producing functional examples for 74% of repositories, while our downstream evaluation shows an ASD agent augmented with a CodeDistiller generated library produces more accurate, complete, and scientifically sound experiments than an agent with only general materials-science code examples.

*Daria Smirnova,Hamid Nasiri,Marta Adamska,Zhengxin Yu,Peter Garraghan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in AI model selection by proposing GUIDE, an energy-aware framework that improves task accuracy and energy efficiency while reducing latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in current Large Language Model-based orchestrators, which rely on qualitative descriptions that misrepresent model capabilities, leading to inefficiencies in accuracy, energy use, and selection processes.

Method: The authors analyze the limitations of existing orchestration methods and propose GUIDE, a framework that incorporates quantitative performance metrics for model selection to optimize energy and task performance.

Result: Experiments show that GUIDE improves accuracy by 0.90%-11.92%, enhances energy efficiency by up to 54%, and reduces model selection latency significantly, from 4.51 seconds to 7.2 milliseconds.

Conclusion: The study concludes that incorporating quantitative performance data into model orchestration processes can significantly improve accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency in AI systems.

Abstract: As modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems become more advanced and capable, they can leverage a wide range of tools and models to perform complex tasks. Today, the task of orchestrating these models is often performed by Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on qualitative descriptions of models for decision-making. However, the descriptions provided to these LLM-based orchestrators do not reflect true model capabilities and performance characteristics, leading to suboptimal model selection, reduced accuracy, and increased energy costs. In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of LLM-based orchestration limitations and propose GUIDE, a new energy-aware model selection framework that accounts for performance-energy trade-offs by incorporating quantitative model performance characteristics in decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE increases accuracy by 0.90%-11.92% across various evaluated tasks, and achieves up to 54% energy efficiency improvement, while reducing orchestrator model selection latency from 4.51 s to 7.2 ms.

### [39] [Foundation Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01107)
*Sanjog Misra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of the "foundation prior," emphasizing that synthetic data from foundation models are structured subjective priors rather than real-world observations, enabling their principled use in empirical and statistical workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interest is growing in leveraging outputs from foundation models, such as large language models, as synthetic data for empirical research and decision-making. However, current approaches risk treating these outputs as real observations, which may lead to flawed analyses.

Method: The authors propose modeling synthetic data using the concept of the foundation prior, which combines the user's primitive prior, the anticipated data distribution, prompt-engineering processes, and trust in foundation models in an exponential-tilted Bayesian framework. This trust parameter governs how synthetic data contributes to empirical workflows.

Result: The foundation prior enables structured incorporation of synthetic data into statistical and econometric workflows, supporting tasks like refining models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient frameworks.

Conclusion: By explicitly framing synthetic data as structured subjective priors, the framework avoids conflating synthetic outputs with real data, providing a principled basis for leveraging foundation models in empirical applications.

Abstract: Foundation models, and in particular large language models, can generate highly informative responses, prompting growing interest in using these ''synthetic'' outputs as data in empirical research and decision-making. This paper introduces the idea of a foundation prior, which shows that model-generated outputs are not as real observations, but draws from the foundation prior induced prior predictive distribution. As such synthetic data reflects both the model's learned patterns and the user's subjective priors, expectations, and biases. We model the subjectivity of the generative process by making explicit the dependence of synthetic outputs on the user's anticipated data distribution, the prompt-engineering process, and the trust placed in the foundation model.
  We derive the foundation prior as an exponential-tilted, generalized Bayesian update of the user's primitive prior, where a trust parameter governs the weight assigned to synthetic data. We then show how synthetic data and the associated foundation prior can be incorporated into standard statistical and econometric workflows, and discuss their use in applications such as refining complex models, informing latent constructs, guiding experimental design, and augmenting random-coefficient and partially linear specifications. By treating generative outputs as structured, explicitly subjective priors rather than as empirical observations, the framework offers a principled way to harness foundation models in empirical work while avoiding the conflation of synthetic ''facts'' with real data.

*Krishna Taduri,Shaunak Dhande,Giacinto Paolo,Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares predictive models for maintenance in manufacturing, highlighting causal AI's significant cost-saving potential and superior performance over correlation-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of optimizing models for predictive maintenance in manufacturing where the cost of missed failures is far greater than that of false alarms.

Method: Evaluated eight predictive models, including causal inference techniques, using real-world data from 10,000 CNC machines and compared their cost and performance metrics.

Result: The causal inference model outperformed correlation-based models, saving $1.16M annually, reducing false alarms by 97%, achieving high precision (92.1%), and reducing the train-test performance gap.

Conclusion: Causal AI shows promise in predictive maintenance, providing better financial outcomes, fewer false alarms, and interpretable results when combined with domain expertise.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments presents a challenging optimization problem characterized by extreme cost asymmetry, where missed failures incur costs roughly fifty times higher than false alarms. Conventional machine learning approaches typically optimize statistical accuracy metrics that do not reflect this operational reality and cannot reliably distinguish causal relationships from spurious correlations. This study evaluates eight predictive models, ranging from baseline statistical approaches to formal causal inference methods, on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with a 3.3% failure prevalence. The formal causal inference model (L5) achieved estimated annual cost savings of 1.16 million USD (a 70.2 percent reduction), outperforming the best correlation-based decision tree model (L3) by approximately 80,000 USD per year. The causal model matched the highest observed recall (87.9 percent) while reducing false alarms by 97 percent (from 165 to 5) and attained a precision of 92.1 percent, with a train-test performance gap of only 2.6 percentage points. These results indicate that causal AI methods, when combined with domain knowledge, can yield superior financial outcomes and more interpretable predictions compared to correlation-based approaches in predictive maintenance applications.

*Chunzheng Zhu,Jialin Shao,Jianxin Lin,Yijun Wang,Jing Wang,Jinhui Tang,Kenli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents fMRI2GES, a novel method to reconstruct co-speech gestures directly from fMRI data using unpaired training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by the brain, due to the lack of paired brain, speech, gesture data.

Method: The authors propose fMRI2GES, which utilizes Dual Brain Decoding Alignment. This aligns fMRI-to-text, text-to-gesture, and unpaired fMRI-to-gesture models, training the network using self-supervision.

Result: The proposed method successfully reconstructs expressive gestures from fMRI recordings and evaluates the impact of different brain areas on this reconstruction.

Conclusion: fMRI2GES provides a new way of decoding co-speech gestures from brain signals, offering insights into brain functions and advancing neuroscience and cognitive science understanding.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain responds to external stimuli and decoding this process has been a significant challenge in neuroscience. While previous studies typically concentrated on brain-to-image and brain-to-language reconstruction, our work strives to reconstruct gestures associated with speech stimuli perceived by brain. Unfortunately, the lack of paired \{brain, speech, gesture\} data hinders the deployment of deep learning models for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, \textbf{fMRI2GES}, that allows training of fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction networks on unpaired data using \textbf{Dual Brain Decoding Alignment}. This method relies on two key components: (i) observed texts that elicit brain responses, and (ii) textual descriptions associated with the gestures. Then, instead of training models in a completely supervised manner to find a mapping relationship among the three modalities, we harness an fMRI-to-text model, a text-to-gesture model with paired data and an fMRI-to-gesture model with unpaired data, establishing dual fMRI-to-gesture reconstruction patterns. Afterward, we explicitly align two outputs and train our model in a self-supervision way. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct expressive gestures directly from fMRI recordings. We also investigate fMRI signals from different ROIs in the cortex and how they affect generation results. Overall, we provide new insights into decoding co-speech gestures, thereby advancing our understanding of neuroscience and cognitive science.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a knowledge graph (KG)-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) framework for visit-level disease prediction using electronic health records (EHRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clinical prediction models lack fine-grained, patient-level explanations for decision-making, limiting their practical utility.

Method: This study maps ICD-9 codes to PrimeKG, extracts reasoning paths, and uses them as scaffolds for CoT generation. Lightweight LLaMA-3.1 and Gemma-7B models are fine-tuned for prediction tasks.

Result: KG-guided models achieved better performance compared to baselines with AUROC values of 0.66-0.70 and macro-AUPR of 0.40-0.47, with significant zero-shot transfer improvements.

Conclusion: The KG-guided CoT framework enhances prediction and provides clinically grounded, temporally consistent explanations preferred by clinicians for real-world use.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) support powerful clinical prediction models, but existing methods typically provide coarse, post hoc explanations that offer limited value for patient-level decision making. We introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that generates clinically grounded and temporally consistent reasoning for visit-level disease prediction in MIMIC-III. ICD-9 codes are mapped to PrimeKG, from which disease-relevant nodes and multi-hop reasoning paths are extracted and used as scaffolds for CoT generation; only explanations whose conclusions match observed outcomes are retained. Lightweight LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B models are then fine-tuned on this supervision corpus. Across ten PrimeKG-mapped diseases and limited training cohorts (400 and 1000 cases), KG-guided models outperform strong classical baselines, achieving AUROC values of 0.66 to 0.70 and macro-AUPR values of 0.40 to 0.47. The models also transfer zero-shot to the CRADLE cohort, improving accuracy from approximately 0.40 to 0.51 up to 0.72 to 0.77. A blinded clinician evaluation shows consistent preference for KG-guided CoT explanations in clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether interpretability techniques can decode hidden reasoning processes in large language models, using a controlled testbed and ROT-13 encryption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address concerns about hidden reasoning processes in language models and test the robustness of current interpretability methods.

Method: They use a fine-tuned reasoning model, ROT-13 encryption, and mechanistic interpretability techniques like logit lens analysis to decode hidden internal activations.

Result: Logit lens analysis proves effective at translating encoded reasoning, with peak accuracy in intermediate-to-late layers, and unsupervised decoding pipelines show significant success.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability techniques may handle models with simple encoded reasoning better than thought, supporting oversight of advanced AI systems.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems.

### [44] [OntoMetric: An Ontology-Guided Framework for Automated ESG Knowledge Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01289)
*Mingqin Yu,Fethi Rabhi,Boming Xia,Zhengyi Yang,Felix Tan,Qinghua Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study proposes OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework for transforming ESG disclosure documents into validated, machine-readable knowledge graphs, achieving higher accuracy and compliance compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to address the challenges of interpreting, standardizing, and auditing ESG disclosure requirements embedded in lengthy, unstructured documents. Manual extraction is unscalable, and existing large language model (LLM)-based methods produce inconsistent and unreliable outputs.

Method: OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline involving: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction with schema-embedded prompts, and (3) two-phase validation combining LLM-based semantic checking and rule-based schema compliance.

Result: OntoMetric achieved significant improvements, with 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance for ESG disclosure frameworks compared to 3-10% and low compliance rates of baseline methods. It also maintains a cost-effective validation process.

Conclusion: The study concludes that integrating symbolic ontology constraints with neural extraction methods can create reliable and auditable knowledge graphs from ESG documents, advancing applications in sustainable finance, compliance tools, and transparency features.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure frameworks such as SASB, TCFD, and IFRS S2 require organizations to compute and report numerous metrics for compliance, yet these requirements are embedded in long, unstructured PDF documents that are difficult to interpret, standardize, and audit. Manual extraction is unscalable, while unconstrained large language model (LLM) extraction often produces inconsistent entities, hallucinated relationships, missing provenance, and high validation failure rates. We present OntoMetric, an ontology-guided framework that transforms ESG regulatory documents into validated, AI- and web-ready knowledge graphs. OntoMetric operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) structure-aware segmentation using table-of-contents boundaries, (2) ontology-constrained LLM extraction that embeds the ESGMKG schema into prompts while enriching entities with semantic fields for downstream reasoning, and (3) two-phase validation that combines LLM-based semantic verification with rule-based schema checking across entity, property, and relationship levels (VR001-VR006). The framework preserves both segment-level and page-level provenance for audit traceability. Evaluated on five ESG standards (SASB Commercial Banks, SASB Semiconductors, TCFD, IFRS S2, AASB S2) totaling 228 pages and 60 segments, OntoMetric achieves 65-90% semantic accuracy and 80-90% schema compliance, compared to 3-10% for baseline unconstrained extraction, at approximately 0.01 to 0.02 USD per validated entity. Our results demonstrate that combining symbolic ontology constraints with neural extraction enables reliable, auditable knowledge graphs suitable for regulatory compliance and web integration, supporting downstream applications such as sustainable-finance analytics, transparency portals, and automated compliance tools.

*Dacheng Liao,Mengshi Qi,Peng Shu,Zhining Zhang,Yuxin Lin,Liang Liu,Huadong Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoboDriveBench, a benchmark for testing the robustness of Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based autonomous driving systems, and proposes RoboDriveVLM and a Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method to address real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the feasibility of VLM-based systems in autonomous driving by addressing robustness issues in real-world scenarios.

Method: Created RoboDriveBench, a robustness evaluation benchmark with 11 simulated scenarios, and developed RoboDriveVLM with Test-Time Adaptation to map multimodal data and enhance robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments highlighted the limitations of existing VLM-based systems, demonstrated enhanced robustness through RoboDriveVLM, and provided a framework for safer real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems face robustness challenges, but RoboDriveBench and the proposed solutions deliver promising frameworks for improvements in real-world applications.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems often leverage large language models to generate driving decisions directly based on their understanding of the current scene. However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems. Through extensive experiments, our work highlights the limitations of current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems and provides a more reliable solution for real-world deployment. Source code and datasets will be released.

*Shinji Mai,Yunpeng Zhai,Ziqian Chen,Cheng Chen,Anni Zou,Shuchang Tao,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of task scarcity in reinforcement learning and proposes a curiosity-driven framework called CuES for autonomously generating diverse and meaningful tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the issue of task scarcity in reinforcement learning, which limits agent improvement in tool-augmented environments lacking predefined tasks.

Method: The proposed CuES framework uses intrinsic curiosity and environment structure to generate executable tasks. It involves exploration, creation of abstract task schemas, top-down refinement, and memory-based quality control.

Result: The CuES framework produces task distributions that are comparable or better than manually created ones across AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop. It also significantly improves policy outcomes.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven and environment-grounded task generation enables scalable reinforcement learning by helping agents learn both actions and learning objectives.

Abstract: Large language model based agents are increasingly deployed in complex, tool augmented environments. While reinforcement learning provides a principled mechanism for such agents to improve through interaction, its effectiveness critically depends on the availability of structured training tasks. In many realistic settings, however, no such tasks exist a challenge we term task scarcity, which has become a key bottleneck for scaling agentic RL. Existing approaches typically assume predefined task collections, an assumption that fails in novel environments where tool semantics and affordances are initially unknown. To address this limitation, we formalize the problem of Task Generation for Agentic RL, where an agent must learn within a given environment that lacks predefined tasks. We propose CuES, a Curiosity driven and Environment grounded Synthesis framework that autonomously generates diverse, executable, and meaningful tasks directly from the environment structure and affordances, without relying on handcrafted seeds or external corpora. CuES drives exploration through intrinsic curiosity, abstracts interaction patterns into reusable task schemas, and refines them through lightweight top down guidance and memory based quality control. Across three representative environments, AppWorld, BFCL, and WebShop, CuES produces task distributions that match or surpass manually curated datasets in both diversity and executability, yielding substantial downstream policy improvements. These results demonstrate that curiosity driven, environment grounded task generation provides a scalable foundation for agents that not only learn how to act, but also learn what to learn.

*Juan Hernandez,Diego Fernández,Manuel Cifuentes,Denis Parra,Rodrigo Toro Icarte*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends the NGU algorithm to multi-agent settings, finding it effective with shared replay buffers and carefully tuned intrinsic exploration signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the potential of NGU in addressing sparse reward challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios.

Method: The study evaluates NGU in a multi-agent PettingZoo environment, examining configurations like shared vs individual replay buffers, novelty sharing, and heterogeneous beta parameters.

Result: NGU outperformed a multi-agent DQN baseline, with the shared replay buffer yielding the best performance and stability. Novelty sharing and heterogeneous beta values had mixed impact.

Conclusion: NGU can effectively handle multi-agent tasks when experiences and intrinsic exploration are properly managed, with shared replay buffers providing a significant advantage.

Abstract: The Never Give Up (NGU) algorithm has proven effective in reinforcement learning tasks with sparse rewards by combining episodic novelty and intrinsic motivation. In this work, we extend NGU to multi-agent environments and evaluate its performance in the simple_tag environment from the PettingZoo suite. Compared to a multi-agent DQN baseline, NGU achieves moderately higher returns and more stable learning dynamics. We investigate three design choices: (1) shared replay buffer versus individual replay buffers, (2) sharing episodic novelty among agents using different k thresholds, and (3) using heterogeneous values of the beta parameter. Our results show that NGU with a shared replay buffer yields the best performance and stability, highlighting that the gains come from combining NGU intrinsic exploration with experience sharing. Novelty sharing performs comparably when k = 1 but degrades learning for larger values. Finally, heterogeneous beta values do not improve over a small common value. These findings suggest that NGU can be effectively applied in multi-agent settings when experiences are shared and intrinsic exploration signals are carefully tuned.

### [48] [A Fast Heuristic Search Approach for Energy-Optimal Profile Routing for Electric Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01331)
*Saman Ahmadi,Mahdi Jalili*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a label-setting method using multi-objective A* search to solve the energy-optimal profile search problem for electric vehicles (EVs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of planning optimal paths for EVs with an unknown initial energy level, which is critical in real-world scenarios involving energy uncertainty.

Method: The study develops a label-setting approach with multi-objective A* search, introducing a novel profile dominance rule that avoids handling complex profiles. Four method variants are implemented and tested.

Result: The proposed energy profile A* search demonstrates performance similar to the energy-optimal A* with known initial energy levels when tested on real-world road networks.

Conclusion: The new approach provides an effective and simpler alternative for solving the energy-optimal profile search problem for EVs in large-scale road networks.

Abstract: We study the energy-optimal shortest path problem for electric vehicles (EVs) in large-scale road networks, where recuperated energy along downhill segments introduces negative energy costs. While traditional point-to-point pathfinding algorithms for EVs assume a known initial energy level, many real-world scenarios involving uncertainty in available energy require planning optimal paths for all possible initial energy levels, a task known as energy-optimal profile search. Existing solutions typically rely on specialized profile-merging procedures within a label-correcting framework that results in searching over complex profiles. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective label-setting approach based on multi-objective A* search, which employs a novel profile dominance rule to avoid generating and handling complex profiles. We develop four variants of our method and evaluate them on real-world road networks enriched with realistic energy consumption data. Experimental results demonstrate that our energy profile A* search achieves performance comparable to energy-optimal A* with a known initial energy level.

### [49] [Benchmarking Overton Pluralism in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01351)
*Elinor Poole-Dayan,Jiayi Wu,Taylor Sorensen,Jiaxin Pei,Michiel A. Bakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to measure Overton pluralism in Large Language Models (LLMs), a metric to gauge diverse viewpoint representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in measuring and improving how well LLMs represent diverse viewpoints, given challenges in human evaluation cost and inefficiency.

Method: The authors developed a formal set coverage metric (OvertonScore), conducted a large-scale human study, and created an automated benchmark closely aligned with human judgment.

Result: The OvertonScores for LLMs range from 0.35–0.41, showing considerable room for improvement. The automated benchmark strongly correlates with human evaluations ($ρ=0.88$).

Conclusion: This work provides a practical, automated method for evaluating pluralism in LLMs, paving the way for developing more inclusive and pluralistic models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for measuring Overton pluralism in LLMs--the extent to which diverse viewpoints are represented in model outputs. We (i) formalize Overton pluralism as a set coverage metric (OvertonScore), (ii) conduct a large-scale U.S.-representative human study (N = 1209; 60 questions; 8 LLMs), and (iii) develop an automated benchmark that closely reproduces human judgments. On average, models achieve OvertonScores of 0.35--0.41, with DeepSeek V3 performing best; yet all models remain far below the theoretical maximum of 1.0, revealing substantial headroom for improvement. Because repeated large-scale human studies are costly and slow, scalable evaluation tools are essential for model development. Hence, we propose an automated benchmark that achieves high rank correlation with human judgments ($ρ=0.88$), providing a practical proxy without replacing human assessment. By turning pluralistic alignment from a normative aim into a measurable benchmark, our work establishes a foundation for systematic progress toward more pluralistic LLMs.

### [50] [The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01354)
*Zhongjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues with current synthetic data models and introduces a framework, PMCSF, to simulate human cognitive processes for generating more effective synthetic text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in existing synthetic data production methods, which fail to capture the irregular characteristics of human text, potentially leading to AI model collapse.

Method: The authors developed the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), including a Cognitive State Decoder to extract cognitive vectors and a Cognitive Text Encoder to simulate human-like text enriched with imperfections using Cognitive Perturbation Operators.

Result: The framework is validated through evaluations, showing significant improvements in text similarity to human writing (Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614) and enhanced robustness in financial stress tests, such as reducing maximum drawdown by 47.4% during a market crash.

Conclusion: Modeling human cognitive limitations offers a new approach to creating synthetic data with practical benefits, helping address issues like AI data-collapse.

Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CollabToolBuilder, a framework with multiple agents and human guidance to iteratively create tools aligning with human goals, demonstrated through examples like research paper generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a framework that aligns tool creation with human objectives while minimizing adaptation time and effort for complex tasks.

Method: A multiagent framework (Coach, Coder, Critic, Capitalizer) integrated with reinforcement prompting and human feedback to iteratively generate and validate tools for specific goals.

Result: Preliminary experiments showcase the framework’s success in generating tools for complex tasks, such as creating structured scientific documents.

Conclusion: CollabToolBuilder is a promising system-level methodology for addressing iterative problem-solving in domains requiring reusable tools and human-in-the-loop guidance.

Abstract: We introduce CollabToolBuilder, a flexible multiagent LLM framework with expert-in-the-loop (HITL) guidance that iteratively learns to create tools for a target goal, aligning with human intent and process, while minimizing time for task/domain adaptation effort and human feedback capture. The architecture generates and validates tools via four specialized agents (Coach, Coder, Critic, Capitalizer) using a reinforced dynamic prompt and systematic human feedback integration to reinforce each agent's role toward goals and constraints. This work is best viewed as a system-level integration and methodology combining multi-agent in-context learning, HITL controls, and reusable tool capitalization for complex iterative problems such as scientific document generation. We illustrate it with preliminary experiments (e.g., generating state-of-the-art research papers or patents given an abstract) and discuss its applicability to other iterative problem-solving.

*Sylvain Marié,Pablo Knecht*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new metric to analyze discrete event systems by combining event transitions and state durations, removing the need for costly resampling during analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency and distortion caused by resampling in the analysis of discrete event systems, which are widespread across natural, socio-economic, and industrial fields.

Method: The authors define state transition event timeseries (STE-ts) and propose the Selective Temporal Hamming distance (STH), a metric that combines transition timing and state duration to ensure precision, computation efficiency, and focus on relevant states.

Result: They demonstrate the enhanced performance of STH compared to traditional metrics like the resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that STH achieves better precision, computational efficiency, and flexibility when analyzing large event and state datasets without requiring resampling.

Abstract: Discrete event systems are present both in observations of nature, socio economical sciences, and industrial systems. Standard analysis approaches do not usually exploit their dual event / state nature: signals are either modeled as transition event sequences, emphasizing event order alignment, or as categorical or ordinal state timeseries, usually resampled a distorting and costly operation as the observation period and number of events grow. In this work we define state transition event timeseries (STE-ts) and propose a new Selective Temporal Hamming distance (STH) leveraging both transition time and duration-in-state, avoiding costly and distorting resampling on large databases. STH generalizes both resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics with better precision and computation time, and an ability to focus on multiple states of interest. We validate these benefits on simulated and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel programmable pipeline utilizing DSPy and its GEPA module for automating risk of bias (RoB) assessment in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using large language models (LLMs). GEPA outperforms manual prompt designs, offering reproducibility, transparency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing approaches for assessing RoB in RCTs are resource-intensive, prone to inter-reviewer variability, and often rely on manual, non-reproducible prompt engineering.

Method: The authors introduced a GEPA module within DSPy that utilizes Pareto-guided search to refine LLM prompts and generates inspectable execution traces for transparency. They tested it against multiple LLMs and compared its performance to manually designed prompts.

Result: GEPA-produced prompts demonstrated the highest accuracy across most RoB domains, with a significant 30%-40% improvement in areas like Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting compared to manual prompts.

Conclusion: GEPA offers structured, reproducible, and highly accurate prompts for automating RoB assessment using LLMs. Its transparency and effectiveness support its potential application in systematic evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Assessing risk of bias (RoB) in randomized controlled trials is essential for trustworthy evidence synthesis, but the process is resource-intensive and prone to variability across reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer a route to automation, but existing methods rely on manually engineered prompts that are difficult to reproduce, generalize, or evaluate. This study introduces a programmable RoB assessment pipeline that replaces ad-hoc prompt design with structured, code-based optimization using DSPy and its GEPA module. GEPA refines LLM reasoning through Pareto-guided search and produces inspectable execution traces, enabling transparent replication of every step in the optimization process. We evaluated the method on 100 RCTs from published meta-analyses across seven RoB domains. GEPA-generated prompts were applied to both open-weight models (Mistral Small 3.1 with GPT-oss-20b) and commercial models (GPT-5 Nano and GPT-5 Mini). In domains with clearer methodological reporting, such as Random Sequence Generation, GEPA-generated prompts performed best, with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding of Participants, while the commercial model performed slightly better overall. We also compared GEPA with three manually designed prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. GEPA achieved the highest overall accuracy and improved performance by 30%-40% in Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting, and showed generally comparable, competitively aligned performance in the other domains relative to manual prompts. These findings suggest that GEPA can produce consistent and reproducible prompts for RoB assessment, supporting the structured and principled use of LLMs in evidence synthesis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces M3PO, a reinforcement learning framework, to improve reasoning in Large Language Models by mitigating internal determinism and leveraging collaborative multi-path learning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs, as traditional methods face limitations due to internal determinism and the inherent constraints of autoregressive decoding.

Method: The proposed M3PO framework uses parallel policy rollouts to incorporate diverse reasoning paths and employs cross-path interactions through a lightweight collaborative mechanism, refining multi-step reasoning with peer feedback.

Result: M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks, improving reasoning accuracy while keeping interpretability and inference efficiency intact.

Conclusion: M3PO demonstrates the potential of multi-path collaborative learning for robust and effective reasoning in LLMs, showcasing improved problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet conventional CoT often exhibits internal determinism during decoding, limiting exploration of plausible alternatives. Recent methods attempt to address this by generating soft abstract tokens to enable reasoning in a continuous semantic space. However, we find that such approaches remain constrained by the greedy nature of autoregressive decoding, which fundamentally isolates the model from alternative reasoning possibilities. In this work, we propose Multi-Path Perception Policy Optimization (M3PO), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly injects collective insights into the reasoning process. M3PO leverages parallel policy rollouts as naturally diverse reasoning sources and integrates cross-path interactions into policy updates through a lightweight collaborative mechanism. This design allows each trajectory to refine its reasoning with peer feedback, thereby cultivating more reliable multi-step reasoning patterns. Empirical results show that M3PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both knowledge- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Models trained with M3PO maintain interpretability and inference efficiency, underscoring the promise of multi-path collaborative learning for robust reasoning.

*Daniel Armstrong,Zlatko Jončev,Andres M Bran,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel methodology employing Large Language Models for translating synthetic chemistry knowledge into formalized, strategic Python functions to improve computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CASP systems often struggle to integrate advanced strategic considerations like convergent assembly, minimizing protecting groups, and optimal ring sequences into the chemical planning process.

Method: The methodology employs Large Language Models to analyze synthetic routes, translating strategic principles into Python functions. These functions serve as interpretable and testable representations of synthetic strategies, released alongside a dataset annotated with strategic tags.

Result: The approach achieved a 75% Top-3 accuracy in route retrieval on the benchmark and enabled historical trend analysis, as well as chemically insightful clustering for improved route partitioning.

Conclusion: The work bridges a key gap in CASP by enabling route analysis and evaluation based on strategic criteria rather than solely structural aspects, opening up new possibilities for more nuanced synthetic planning and retrieval.

Abstract: Modern computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) systems show promises at generating chemically valid reaction steps but struggle to incorporate strategic considerations such as convergent assembly, protecting group minimization, and optimal ring-forming sequences. We introduce a methodology that leverages Large Language Models to distill synthetic knowledge into code. Our system analyzes synthesis routes and translates strategic principles into Python functions representing diverse strategic and tactical rules, such as strategic functional group interconversions and ring construction strategies. By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods. This work bridges the tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone.

### [56] [LEC: Linear Expectation Constraints for False-Discovery Control in Selective Prediction and Routing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01556)
*Zhiyuan Wang,Aniri,Tianlong Chen,Yue Zhang,Heng Tao Shen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method called LEC ensures low error rates for decisions made by large language models (LLMs) by enforcing a statistical control called False Discovery Rate (FDR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unreliable nature of answers generated by LLMs and the ineffectiveness of heuristic uncertainty methods in differentiating correct from incorrect predictions prompted the development of this approach.

Method: LEC enforces a Linear Expectation Constraint over error and selection indicators to ensure FDR control. It uses a calibration sample to compute suitable thresholds and extends to a two-model routing system to delegate uncertain predictions while maintaining FDR guarantees.

Result: LEC achieves better error control and higher dataset retention in experiments with question-answering datasets. The two-model routing mechanism also outperforms single model systems in terms of accepting correct answers while controlling risks.

Conclusion: LEC is effective in achieving reliable decision-making for LLMs by controlling the false discovery rate and improving overall performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transfer learning approach combining pre-trained language and policy models for multi-task reinforcement learning, inspired by CLIP principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for agents capable of solving multiple tasks within the same environment using efficient transfer methods, particularly for language-associated tasks.

Method: The method builds on the CLIP principles to unify representations of task instructions (language) and policies (actions) into a shared space for efficient multi-task transfer in reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments show the approach leads to faster task transfer and improved performance in reinforcement learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed unified representation for natural language and policies facilitates better transferability and efficiency in solving multiple tasks in reinforcement learning domains.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an increasing need to develop agents capable of solving multiple tasks within the same environment, especially when these tasks are naturally associated with language. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages combinations of pre-trained (language, policy) pairs to establish an efficient transfer pipeline. Our algorithm is inspired by the principles of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in Computer Vision, which aligns representations across different modalities under the philosophy that ''two modalities representing the same concept should have similar representations.'' The central idea here is that the instruction and corresponding policy of a task represent the same concept, the task itself, in two different modalities. Therefore, by extending the idea of CLIP to RL, our method creates a unified representation space for natural language and policy embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in achieving faster transfer across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective and interpretable analysis of historical events, which involve sparse, noisy data and lack counterfactual scenarios.

Method: The framework integrates Bayesian uncertainty quantification, structural causal models, Shapley value-based fair modeling, and attention-based neural architectures for analyzing historical events.

Result: The framework was validated on two historical case studies, providing insights into the Partition of Africa and the Punic Wars, showcasing its capability to quantify structural tensions, simulate battle outcomes, and identify key factors such as political support.

Conclusion: HistoricalML demonstrates robust performance in sparse data scenarios by leveraging domain knowledge, causal reasoning, and fairness-focused modeling, offering interpretable and consistent results.

Abstract: Modeling historical events poses fundamental challenges for machine learning: extreme data scarcity (N << 100), heterogeneous and noisy measurements, missing counterfactuals, and the requirement for human interpretable explanations. We present HistoricalML, a probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework that addresses these challenges through principled integration of (1) Bayesian uncertainty quantification to separate epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, (2) structural causal models for counterfactual reasoning under confounding, (3) cooperative game theory (Shapley values) for fair allocation modeling, and (4) attention based neural architectures for context dependent factor weighting. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our approach achieves consistent estimation in the sparse data regime when strong priors from domain knowledge are available, and that Shapley based allocation satisfies axiomatic fairness guarantees that pure regression approaches cannot provide. We instantiate the framework on two historical case studies: the 19th century partition of Africa (N = 7 colonial powers) and the Second Punic War (N = 2 factions). Our model identifies Germany's +107.9 percent discrepancy as a quantifiable structural tension preceding World War I, with tension factor 36.43 and 0.79 naval arms race correlation. For the Punic Wars, Monte Carlo battle simulations achieve a 57.3 percent win probability for Carthage at Cannae and 57.8 percent for Rome at Zama, aligning with historical outcomes. Counterfactual analysis reveals that Carthaginian political support (support score 6.4 vs Napoleon's 7.1), rather than military capability, was the decisive factor.

### [59] [Who Judges the Judge? LLM Jury-on-Demand: Building Trustworthy LLM Evaluation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01786)
*Xiaochuan Li,Ke Wang,Girija Gouda,Shubham Choudhary,Yaqun Wang,Linwei Hu,Joel Vaughan,Freddy Lecue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive evaluation system called LLM Jury-on-Demand, using dynamic and learning-based methods to ensure reliability for high-stakes LLM applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to develop scalable and reliable evaluation methods for LLMs in high-stakes fields where human evaluation is impractical due to cost and time constraints, while single or static LLM judges are neither adaptable nor unbiased.

Method: The authors designed a framework that trains reliability predictors using features like token distributions and embeddings. It creates dynamic juries by selecting the most reliable judges per data point and assigns scores weighted by their reliability.

Result: The dynamic jury system outperforms single-judge and static-jury approaches in correlation with human judgments on summarization and RAG benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive, learning-based juries can enhance the scalability, reliability, and trustworthiness of evaluation systems for LLMs in critical domains.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integrated into high-stakes domains, there is a growing need for evaluation methods that are both scalable for real-time deployment and reliable for critical decision-making. While human evaluation is reliable, it is slow and costly. Single LLM judges are biased, and static juries lack adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM Jury-on-Demand - a dynamic, learning-based framework for scalable and context-aware evaluation. Our method trains a set of reliability predictors to assess when LLM judges will agree with human experts, leveraging token distributions, embeddings, and structural input features. This enables a fully adaptive evaluation where, for each data point, an optimal jury of the most reliable judges is dynamically selected, and their scores are aggregated using their reliability as weights. Experiments on summarization and RAG benchmarks show that our dynamic jury system achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgment than both single-judge and static-jury baselines. These results highlight the promise of adaptive, learning-based juries for building scalable, more reliable and trustworthy evaluation systems for modern LLMs in high-stakes domains.

*Cheng Gao,Huimin Chen,Chaojun Xiao,Zhiyi Chen,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the neuron-level mechanisms behind hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), identifying a sparse subset of these neurons linked to such behavior and tracing their origins to the pre-training phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the mystery behind why large language models generate hallucinations by analyzing them at the neuron level, targeting their identification, impact, and origins.

Method: The researchers identify a sparse set of neurons linked to hallucinations, test their behavioral effects through controlled interventions, and trace their origins to pre-training models.

Result: Less than 0.1% of neurons can reliably predict hallucinations and show causal links to over-compliance in LLM outputs. These neurons emerge during pre-training and generalize across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings reveal neuron-level mechanisms behind LLM hallucinations, offering a foundation to design more reliable and accurate systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.

*Alessandro Breccia,Federica Gerace,Marco Lippi,Gabriele Sicuro,Pierluigi Contucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using a Large Language Model (GPT-2) to study patterns in arithmetic tree structures derived from prime factorization of integers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if a transformer-based model can understand and predict the internal grammar of arithmetic structures, even within deterministic and mathematically generated sequences.

Method: The authors trained the GPT-2 model on $10^{11}$ tree-structure sequences derived from iterated prime factorizations of natural numbers and tested its performance in prediction tasks.

Result: The model successfully captures some regularities and correlations in the tree sequences but does not fully learn the internal arithmetic structure.

Conclusion: The study suggests that machine learning models can partially learn and identify patterns in deterministic arithmetic structures, extending beyond empirical data analysis.

Abstract: We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.

TL;DR: The paper applies the Free Energy Principle (FEP) in neuroscience to knowledge graphs (KGs), proposing that reasoning can be guided by surprise minimization based on graph distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect the Free Energy Principle from neuroscience (focused on minimizing surprise) with knowledge graph reasoning, and explore its applications for designing KG-based frameworks.

Method: The paper formalizes surprise in KGs using shortest-path graph distances and integrates this concept within graph neural network mechanisms and model-based reinforcement learning frameworks.

Result: The study provides a framework and theoretical groundwork to use distance-based surprise minimization for reasoning in KGs.

Conclusion: Surprise minimization guided by graph distance could lead to advancements in KG-based reasoning systems, aligning with neural and tree-structure-based surprise minimization principles.

Abstract: In this work, we propose that reasoning in knowledge graph (KG) networks can be guided by surprise minimization. Entities that are close in graph distance will have lower surprise than those farther apart. This connects the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from neuroscience to KG systems, where the KG serves as the agent's generative model. We formalize surprise using the shortest-path distance in directed graphs and provide a framework for KG-based agents. Graph distance appears in graph neural networks as message passing depth and in model-based reinforcement learning as world model trajectories. This work-in-progress study explores whether distance-based surprise can extend recent work showing that syntax minimizes surprise and free energy via tree structures.

### [63] [Predicting Human Chess Moves: An AI Assisted Analysis of Chess Games Using Skill-group Specific n-gram Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01880)
*Daren Zhong,Dingcheng Huang,Clayton Greenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for predicting chess moves tailored to skill levels using n-gram language models, achieving improved prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chess analysis tools overlook variability in human playing styles across different skill levels, emphasizing optimal moves but not behavioral insights.

Method: The framework uses n-gram language models trained for different skill levels, dynamically selecting the most suitable model to predict moves based on game sequences.

Result: Accuracy for skill classification reaches 31.7% using early game data, and move prediction accuracy improves by up to 39.1% compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances chess move prediction accuracy, adapts to player skill levels, and operates efficiently in real-time, addressing limitations of traditional systems.

Abstract: Chess, a deterministic game with perfect information, has long served as a benchmark for studying strategic decision-making and artificial intelligence. Traditional chess engines or tools for analysis primarily focus on calculating optimal moves, often neglecting the variability inherent in human chess playing, particularly across different skill levels.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel and computationally efficient move prediction framework that approaches chess move prediction as a behavioral analysis task. The framework employs n-gram language models to capture move patterns characteristic of specific player skill levels. By dividing players into seven distinct skill groups, from novice to expert, we trained separate models using data from the open-source chess platform Lichess. The framework dynamically selects the most suitable model for prediction tasks and generates player moves based on preceding sequences.
  Evaluation on real-world game data demonstrates that the model selector module within the framework can classify skill levels with an accuracy of up to 31.7\% when utilizing early game information (16 half-moves). The move prediction framework also shows substantial accuracy improvements, with our Selector Assisted Accuracy being up to 39.1\% more accurate than our benchmark accuracy. The computational efficiency of the framework further enhances its suitability for real-time chess analysis.

### [64] [Learned-Rule-Augmented Large Language Model Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01958)
*Jie Meng,Jin Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) as general evaluators across diverse tasks through rule-based strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for using LLMs as evaluators rely on human-designed and costly evaluation principles that often misalign with annotated data and LLMs' understanding, limiting generalizability.

Method: The authors propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. It consists of a rule distillation method using LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to extract rules and two strategies: Chain-of-Rule (CoR) guidance and reinforcement learning to train rule-augmented LLM evaluators (RuAE).

Result: The proposed approach enhances scalability, improves alignment between rules and data, and generalizes successfully across various evaluation tasks, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Rule-based augmentation enables LLMs to serve as effective general evaluators, addressing limitations of reliance on costly human-designed evaluations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are predominantly used as evaluators for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, but their application to broader evaluation scenarios remains limited. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs as general evaluators across diverse tasks. Although LLM-based evaluators have made progress in different areas, existing methods struggle to generalize due to their reliance on costly, human-designed evaluation principles, which are often misaligned with both annotated data and LLMs' understanding.To address these challenges, we propose a rule-augmented evaluation paradigm. First, we introduce a rule distillation method that automatically extracts scoring rules from data using an LLM-assisted Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), alleviating scalability issues and improving alignment with data. Second, to enable LLMs to effectively apply the learned rules, we propose two strategies: (1) Chain-of-Rule (CoR), which guides LLM to follow distilled rules, and (2) training a rule-augmented LLM evaluator (RuAE) via reinforcement learning, further bridging the gap between rules and LLMs' reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across various evaluation scenarios.

*Sitao Cheng,Xunjian Yin,Ruiwen Zhou,Yuxuan Li,Xinyi Wang,Liangming Pan,William Yang Wang,Victor Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) affects reasoning tasks, demonstrating that RL can synthesize new reasoning strategies only when models first master foundational skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether RL contributes to reasoning by synthesizing skills or amplifying existing ones, especially in tasks requiring integration of internal and external knowledge.

Method: The study uses a synthetic dataset of human biographies to decouple Complementary Reasoning into atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual Reasoning) and evaluates models across various generalization settings using SFT and RL approaches.

Result: SFT models perform well in-distribution but fail with out-of-distribution generalization, particularly zero-shot. RL enables complex reasoning but only if models previously mastered atomic skills via SFT.

Conclusion: RL is not just an amplifier but a reasoning synthesizer, capable of combining learned primitives into complex strategies if foundational skills are established first through decoupled training.

Abstract: The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain of Ground (CoG), a method for improved GUI grounding through a training-free multi-step iterative refinement process, achieving significant improvements in accuracy on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in multimodal large language models for GUI grounding, particularly with visually similar small targets and ambiguous layouts, and enhance reasoning potential.

Method: Proposes a training-free, multi-step grounding framework utilizing multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and hypothesis refinement.

Result: Achieves 68.4% accuracy on ScreenSpot Pro benchmark (4.8-point improvement) and 6.9-point improvement on newly introduced TPanel UI dataset compared to a strong baseline.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement without additional training is more effective for GUI grounding, enhancing accuracy and generalization in both real-world and digital interfaces.

Abstract: GUI grounding aims to align natural language instructions with precise regions in complex user interfaces. Advanced multimodal large language models show strong ability in visual GUI grounding but still struggle with small or visually similar targets and ambiguity in real world layouts. These limitations arise from limited grounding capacity and from underuse of existing reasoning potential. We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces. These results highlight a direction for unlocking grounding potential through structured iterative refinement instead of additional training.

*Sai Kolasani,Maxim Saplin,Nicholas Crispino,Kyle Montgomery,Jared Quincy Davis,Matei Zaharia,Chi Wang,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM CHESS, an evaluation framework to assess reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs through chess interaction. It compares over 50 models' performance and highlights gaps in their reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark that evaluates reasoning and dynamic instruction-following capabilities in LLMs without bias from overfitting or static tasks.

Method: Over 50 LLMs were tested by playing chess against random opponents, analyzing behavioral metrics like win rates, move quality, and legality. Top models were also evaluated against a variable-strength chess engine to estimate Elo ratings.

Result: The benchmarks revealed many state-of-the-art models struggled with even simple chess tasks, showing a separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. The dynamic framework proved challenging for advanced reasoning models.

Conclusion: LLM CHESS provides a unique and dynamic way to test reasoning capabilities in LLMs, highlighting their limitations and enabling more robust evaluations. The framework, leaderboard, and datasets are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: We introduce LLM CHESS, an evaluation framework designed to probe the generalization of reasoning and instruction-following abilities in large language models (LLMs) through extended agentic interaction in the domain of chess. We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models. To support future work on evaluating reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs, we release our experimental framework, a public leaderboard, and a dataset of associated games.

*Yuqin Zhao,Linghui Ye,Haihang Xia,Luke Seed,Tiantai Deng*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Python-based high-level synthesis tool, VeriPy, designed to simplify hardware accelerator development for Software-defined radio (SDR) applications without requiring detailed hardware expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDR applications require hardware accelerators for enhanced performance, presenting a challenge for communication engineers lacking deep hardware knowledge. Thus, there is a need for an accessible synthesis tool.

Method: The authors proposed VeriPy, a Python-based tool that generates hardware designs in Verilog for SDR applications without requiring HDL knowledge. It includes features like testbench generation, performance estimation, and optimization options.

Result: Hardware generated by VeriPy operates with up to 70% faster frequency compared to pragma-optimized Vivado HLS designs, while balancing performance and resource consumption similar to hand-coded implementations.

Conclusion: VeriPy simplifies hardware design for SDR engineers by reducing complexity and eliminating the need for hardware coding expertise, while achieving high performance and optimization.

Abstract: Software-defined radio (SDR) plays an important role in the communication field by providing a flexible and customized communication system for different purposes according to the needs. To enhance the performance of SDR applications, hardware accelerators have been widely deployed in recent years. In facing this obstacle, a necessity arises for a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool specifically designed for communication engineers without detailed hardware knowledge. To lower the barrier between SDR engineers and hardware development, this work proposed a Python-based HLS tool, VeriPy, which can generate both mainstream architecture for hardware accelerators in Verilog specifically for SDR designs including unrolled design and pipelined design, requiring no detailed digital hardware knowledge or Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Furthermore, VeriPy supports automatic testbench generation with random input stimulus, an extensible hardware library, performance and resource estimation, and offers strong optimisation potential at both the algorithmic and digital hardware levels. The generated hardware design by VeriPy can achieve up to 70% faster operating frequency compared to pragma-optimised Vivado HLS designs with a reasonably higher resource con-sumption while delivering comparable performance and resource consumption to hand-coded implementations. Regarding code complexity, VeriPy requires no pragmas, completely eliminating the need for low-level hardware knowledge. For straightforward algorithms, the input code length remains comparable to that of Vivado HLS.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic approach for agentic automated processor design and verification, emphasizing modular design through AI tools. Two processors were developed to demonstrate the methodology on scalable platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of hardware design processes necessitates improved methodologies. Generative AI provides an opportunity to automate significant portions of these processes.

Method: The authors used agentic automation with optional specifications, breaking down designs into sub-components. Tasks such as HDL generation, testbench creation, and component verification were executed with engineers guiding debugging and synthesis.

Result: Two processors were designed and verified: (1) a LEGv8-like processor verified, synthesized, and programmed into DE-10 Lite FPGA; (2) RISC-V-like processor verified and synthesized but not programmed. The process utilized around one million inference tokens per processor.

Conclusion: The approach is scalable, cost-effective, and demonstrated potential for experimentation with system-on-chip designs in future work. Specialized hardware is not required for design or verification.

Abstract: The ever increasing complexity of the hardware design process demands improved hardware design and verification methodologies. With the advent of generative AI various attempts have been made to automate parts of the design and verification process. Large language models (LLMs) as well as specialized models generate hdl and testbenches for small components, having a few leaf level components. However, there are only a few attempts to automate the entire processor design process. Hardware design demands hierarchical and modular design processes. We utilized this best practice systematically and effectively. We propose agentic automated processor design and verification with engineers in the loop. The agent with optional specification tries to break down the design into sub-components, generate HDL and cocotb tests, and verifies the components involving engineer guidance, especially during debugging and synthesis. We designed various digital systems using this approach. However, we selected two simple processors for demonstration purposes in this work. The first one is a LEGv8 like a simple processor verified, synthesized and programmed for the DE-10 Lite FPGA. The second one is a RISC-V like 32-bit processor designed and verified in similar manner and synthesized. However, it is not programmed into the DE-10 Lite. This process is accomplished usually using around a million inference tokens per processor, using a combination of reasoning (e.g gemini-pro) and non-reasoning models (eg. gpt-5-mini) based on the complexity of the task. This indicates that hardware design and verification experimentation can be done cost effectively without using any specialized hardware. The approach is scalable, we even attempted system-on-chip, which we want to experiment in our future work.

*Kunlong Zhang,Guiying Li,Ning Lu,Peng Yang,Ke Tang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework designed for homogeneous edge devices, achieving optimal average performance across these devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN compression methods fail to account for variations in performance due to differences in configurations, environments, and hardware of homogeneous edge devices. This results in inconsistent compression outcomes.

Method: The HDAP framework partitions devices into clusters and employs surrogate-based evaluations instead of time-consuming real-time hardware assessments, ensuring scalable and efficient optimization.

Result: Experiments on Jetson Xavier NX, Jetson Nano, and multiple tasks indicate HDAP achieves lower average latency, competitive accuracy, and significant speedups compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HDAP is an effective and scalable approach for high-performance DNN deployment on homogeneous edge devices while addressing variability in device performance.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) across homogeneous edge devices (the devices with the same SKU labeled by the manufacturer) often assumes identical performance among them. However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Extensive experiments on multiple device types (Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano) and task types (image classification with ResNet50, MobileNetV1, ResNet56, VGG16; object detection with YOLOv8n) demonstrate that HDAP consistently achieves lower average latency and competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant speedups (e.g., 2.86$\times$ on ResNet50 at 1.0G FLOPs). HDAP offers an effective solution for scalable, high-performance DNN deployment methods for homogeneous edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a comprehensive review of LLM-based methods applied to Verilog code generation, crucial for automating hardware design processes.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic literature review, analyzing 102 papers from domains like Software Engineering, AI, and EDA, structured around four research questions focused on LLM usage, datasets, techniques, and alignment approaches for Verilog generation.

Result: The review identifies key LLMs used for Verilog generation, evaluates datasets and metrics, categorizes techniques, and analyzes current alignment approaches, while pinpointing existing limitations in the field.

Conclusion: The study outlines current gaps in LLM-driven Verilog generation and proposes a roadmap for future research, aiming to improve automated hardware design workflows.

Abstract: Code generation has emerged as a critical research area at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), attracting significant attention from both academia and industry. Within this broader landscape, Verilog, as a representative hardware description language (HDL), plays a fundamental role in digital circuit design and verification, making its automated generation particularly significant for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Consequently, recent research has increasingly focused on applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to Verilog code generation, particularly at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), exploring how these AI-driven techniques can be effectively integrated into hardware design workflows. Despite substantial research efforts have explored LLM applications in this domain, a comprehensive survey synthesizing these developments remains absent from the literature. This review fill addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review of LLM-based methods for Verilog code generation, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for advancing automated hardware design. The review encompasses research work from conferences and journals in the fields of SE, AI, and EDA, encompassing 70 papers published on venues, along with 32 high-quality preprint papers, bringing the total to 102 papers. By answering four key research questions, we aim to (1) identify the LLMs used for Verilog generation, (2) examine the datasets and metrics employed in evaluation, (3) categorize the techniques proposed for Verilog generation, and (4) analyze LLM alignment approaches for Verilog generation. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of limitations of existing studies. Finally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities for future research endeavors in LLM-assisted hardware design.

*Mahek Desai,Rowena Quinn,Marjan Asadinia*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on enhancing phase-change memory (PCM) performance using a neural network model to predict critical parameters, addressing its scalability and energy consumption issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase-change memory (PCM) is explored as an alternative to conventional memory systems like DRAM due to its scalability and zero leakage power, but adoption is limited by endurance and energy issues.

Method: The authors propose a neural network (NN) to predict PCM parameters, including write latency, energy consumption, and endurance, by monitoring real-time conditions and device characteristics.

Result: The neural network achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.0073% for endurance, 0.23% for write latency, and 4.92% for write energy, demonstrating effective prediction capabilities.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that using neural networks significantly improves PCM performance, making it a viable and efficient option for storage systems requiring frequent write operations.

Abstract: As transistor-based memory technologies like dynamic random access memory (DRAM) approach their scalability limits, the need to explore alternative storage solutions becomes increasingly urgent. Phase-change memory (PCM) has gained attention as a promising option due to its scalability, fast access speeds, and zero leakage power compared to conventional memory systems. However, despite these advantages, PCM faces several challenges that impede its broader adoption, particularly its limited lifespan due to material degradation during write operations, as well as the high energy demands of these processes. For PCM to become a viable storage alternative, enhancing its endurance and reducing the energy required for write operations are essential. This paper proposes the use of a neural network (NN) model to predict critical parameters such as write latency, energy consumption, and endurance by monitoring real-time operating conditions and device characteristics. These predictions are key to improving PCM performance and identifying optimal write settings, making PCM a more practical and efficient option for data storage in applications with frequent write operations. Our approach leads to significant improvements, with NN predictions achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.0073% for endurance, 0.23% for total write latency, and 4.92% for total write energy.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes fault impacts on Systolic Array-based Deep Neural Network accelerators caused by radiation and proposes a fault mitigation strategy to improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of DNN accelerators to radiation-induced faults in harsh environments and ensure their reliable functioning.

Method: The study conducts RTL Fault Injection simulations to analyze the sensitivity of hardware blocks to faults using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Result: The paper measures fault propagation and classification error probabilities, identifying critical areas and proposing an efficient fault mitigation strategy.

Conclusion: An efficient and hardware-aware fault mitigation technique is designed to enhance the robustness of SA-DNN accelerators against radiation-induced faults.

Abstract: In recent years, the increased interest and the growth in application domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more specifically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has led to an extensive usage of domain specific DNN accelerator processors to improve the computational efficiency of DNN inference. However, like any digital circuit, these processors are prone to faults induced by radiation particles such as heavy ions, protons, etc., making their use in harsh radiation environments a challenge. This work presents an in-depth analysis of the impact of such faults on the computational pipeline of a Systolic Array based Deep Neural Network accelerator (SA-DNN accelerator) by means of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) Fault Injection (FI) simulation in order to improve the observability of each hardware block. From this analysis, we present the sensitivity to single bit faults of register groups in the pipeline for three different DNN workloads utilising two datasets, namely MNIST and CIFAR-10. These sensitivity figures are presented in terms of Fault Propagation Probability ($P(f_{non-crit})$) and False Classification Probability ($P(f_{crit})$) which respectively show the probability that an injected fault causes a non-critical error (numerical offset) or a critical error (classification fault). From these results, we devise a fault mitigation strategy to harden the SA-DNN accelerator in an efficient way, both in terms of area and power overhead.

*Yuhao Gu,Zhongchun Zheng,Nong Xiao,Yutong Lu,Xianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid system combining compilation and emulation for cross-ISA execution, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-ISA execution has become common but suffers from performance issues, especially with dynamic binary translation.

Method: The hybrid system selectively offloads functions using a mechanism that establishes cross-environment calling channels, optimizing offloading costs.

Result: Achieves up to 13x speed improvement over existing dynamic binary translation methods.

Conclusion: This approach offers significant practical value by reducing emulation overhead and improving performance in cross-ISA program execution.

Abstract: With the growing diversity of instruction set architectures (ISAs), cross-ISA program execution has become common. Dynamic binary translation (DBT) is the main solution but suffers from poor performance. Cross-compilation avoids emulation costs but is constrained by an "all-or-nothing" model-programs are either fully cross-compiled or entirely emulated. Complete cross-compilation is often unfeasible due to ISA-specific code or missing dependencies, leaving programs with high emulation overhead.
  We propose a hybrid execution system that combines compilation and emulation, featuring a selective function offloading mechanism. This mechanism establishes cross-environment calling channels, offloading eligible functions to the host for native execution to reduce DBT overhead. Key optimizations address offloading costs, enabling efficient hybrid operation. Built on LLVM and QEMU, the system works automatically for both applications and libraries. Evaluations show it achieves up to 13x speedups over existing DBT, with strong practical value.

Abstract: We present XgenSilicon ML Compiler, a fully automated end-to-end compilation framework that transforms high-level machine learning models into optimized RISC-V assembly code for custom ASIC accelerators. By unifying the system's cost model across software and hardware, the compiler achieves significant improvements in Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) metrics compared to standard off-the-shelf components and hand-designed chips through five key innovations: (1) a multi-algorithm auto-tuning framework with five search strategies (Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Random Search, Grid Search) combined with a learned cost model, (2) an integrated quantization framework supporting extreme precisions from FP32 to Binary with full KL divergence calibration (2048-bin histogram optimization) and momentum-based QAT gradient updates, (3) hardware-aware validation ensuring 100 percent ISA compliance and memory constraint satisfaction, (4) dynamic shape support with multi-configuration specialization, and (5) advanced cache-aware cost modeling with multi-level cache hierarchy analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates that ASICs produced by this compiler achieve 2.5-4.5x better performance, 3-6x lower power consumption, and 40-60 percent area reduction compared to baseline implementations. The compiler supports more than 100 ONNX operators across 12 categories, implements advanced RISC-V Vector optimizations, and generates hardware-validated assembly code suitable for direct ASIC synthesis. All compilation steps are fully automated, requiring zero manual intervention from model input to ASIC-ready output.

*Giuseppe M. Sarda,Nimish Shah,Abubakr Nada,Debjyoti Bhattacharjee,Marian Verhelst*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhancements to the Vortex open-source GPGPU platform to improve its performance and competitiveness in the GPU research landscape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the open-source Vortex GPGPU platform in performance compared to commercial GPUs, specifically targeting issues with control flow (CF) and memory orchestration.

Method: The authors propose decoupling CF and data access via: 1) a hardware CF manager for efficient branching and predication, and 2) decoupled memory streaming lanes for better memory latency handling.

Result: The improvements lead to 8× faster kernel execution, a 10× reduction in dynamic instruction count, and a performance boost from 0.35 to 1.63 GFLOP/s/mm².

Conclusion: The proposed micro-architecture modifications significantly enhance Vortex, making it a competitive and suitable platform for GPGPU research and Machine Learning applications.

Abstract: Vortex, a newly proposed open-source GPGPU platform based on the RISC-V ISA, offers a valid alternative for GPGPU research over the broadly-used modeling platforms based on commercial GPUs. Similarly to the push originating from the RISC-V movement for CPUs, Vortex can enable a myriad of fresh research directions for GPUs. However, as a young hardware platform, it currently lacks the performance competitiveness of commercial GPUs, which is crucial for widespread adoption. State-of-the-art GPUs, in fact, rely on complex architectural features, still unavailable in Vortex, to hide the micro-code overheads linked to control flow (CF) management and memory orchestration for data access. In particular, these components account for the majority of the dynamic instruction count in regular, memory-intensive kernels, such as linear algebra routines, which form the basis of many applications, including Machine Learning. To address these challenges with simple yet powerful micro-architecture modifications, this paper introduces decoupled CF and data access through 1.) a hardware CF manager to accelerate branching and predication in regular loop execution and 2.) decoupled memory streaming lanes to further hide memory latency with useful computation. The evaluation results for different kernels show 8$\times$ faster execution, 10$\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count, and overall performance improvement from 0.35 to 1.63 $\mathrm{GFLOP/s/mm^2}$. Thanks to these enhancements, Vortex can become an ideal playground to enable GPGPU research for the next generation of Machine Learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in portability, maintainability, and deployment of software in heterogeneous IoT hardware and software environments.

Method: Performance, memory footprint, and energy consumption of WASM runtimes (WAMR and wasm3) were tested on Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32 C6, and nRF5340 microcontrollers; results were compared against native C execution.

Result: Native C is faster and more energy-efficient; however, WASM provides acceptable trade-offs, offering cross-platform compatibility and secure sandbox execution.

Conclusion: WASM is a viable choice for embedded IoT systems if portability and security are prioritized over performance, with potential for further runtime optimization.

Abstract: The increasing heterogeneity of hardware and software in the Internet of Things (IoT) poses a major challenge for the portability, maintainability and deployment of software on devices with limited resources. WebAssembly (WASM), originally designed for the web, is increasingly recognized as a portable, secure and efficient runtime environment that can overcome these challenges. This paper explores the feasibility of using WASM in embedded IoT systems by evaluating its performance, memory footprint and energy consumption on three representative microcontrollers: the Raspberry Pi Pico, the ESP32 C6 and the nRF5340. Two lightweight WASM runtimes, WAMR and wasm3, are compared with the native C execution. The results show that while the native execution remains superior in terms of speed and energy efficiency, WASM offers acceptable trade-offs in return for cross-platform compatibility and sandbox execution. The results highlight that WASM is a viable option for embedded IoT applications when portability and security outweigh strict performance constraints, and that further runtime optimization could extend its practicality in this area.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces TD-Placer, a novel framework for timing-driven global placement in FPGA designs, improving Worst Negative Slack (WNS) by 10% and Critical Path Delay (CPD) by 5% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in FPGA timing optimization caused by dense interconnects, nonlinear constraints, and crosstalk effects, which hinder timing closure in modern large-scale designs.

Method: TD-Placer uses graph-based representations and a nonlinear model for delay prediction. It incorporates a quadratic placement objective minimizing wirelength and employs a lightweight algorithm for timing optimization with a finer-grained net-level weighting scheme.

Result: TD-Placer outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an average 10% WNS improvement and 5% CPD reduction in experiments on seven real-world FPGA projects. It achieves CPD close to commercial tools like AMD Vivado.

Conclusion: TD-Placer offers a high-quality, efficient, and publicly accessible solution for timing-driven FPGA global placement, advancing performance and timing closure in diverse real-world designs.

Abstract: Timing optimization during global placement is critical for achieving optimal circuit performance and remains a key challenge in modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design. As FPGA designs scale and heterogeneous resources increase, dense interconnects introduce significant resistive and capacitive effects, making timing closure increasingly difficult. Existing methods face challenges in constructing accurate timing models due to multi-factor nonlinear constraints as well as load and crosstalk coupling effects arising in multi-pin driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TD-Placer, a critical path aware, timing-driven global placement framework. It leverages graph-based representations to capture global net interactions and employs a nonlinear model to integrate diverse timing-related features for precise delay prediction, thereby improving the overall placement quality for FPGAs. TD-Placer adopts a quadratic placement objective that minimizes wirelength while incorporating a timing term constructed by a lightweight algorithm, enabling efficient and high-quality timing optimization. Regarding net-level timing contention, it also employs a finer-grained weighting scheme to facilitate smooth reduction of the Critical Path Delay (CPD). Extensive experiments were carried out on seven real-world open-source FPGA projects with LUT counts ranging from 60K to 400K. The results demonstrate that TD-Placer achieves an average 10% improvement in Worst Negative Slack (WNS) and a 5% reduction in CPD compared to the state-of-the-art method, with an average CPD comparable (*1.01) to the commercial AMD Vivado across five versions (2020.2-2024.2). Its code and dataset are publicly available.

TL;DR: SetupKit is an advanced framework designed for efficient setup/hold time characterization, significantly reducing simulation time through statistical intelligence, circuit analysis, and active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency and extended durations of traditional SPICE simulation-based setup/hold time characterization processes across multiple PVT corners, which are a bottleneck in modern chip design.

Method: SetupKit integrates a bias-enhanced interpolation search (BEIRA), initial interval estimation via circuit analysis, and an active learning strategy using Gaussian Process to optimize simulation efficiency and minimize redundancy.

Result: SetupKit achieves a 2.4x reduction in CPU time, decreasing total characterization time from 720 to 290 days on industrial 22nm cells across 16 PVT corners.

Conclusion: This framework addresses a critical challenge in EDA by providing a principled, learning-based approach to expedite and refine setup/hold time characterization processes.

Abstract: Accurate setup/hold time characterization is crucial for modern chip timing closure, but its reliance on potentially millions of SPICE simulations across diverse process-voltagetemperature (PVT) corners creates a major bottleneck, often lasting weeks or months. Existing methods suffer from slow search convergence and inefficient exploration, especially in the multi-corner setting. We introduce SetupKit, a novel framework designed to break this bottleneck using statistical intelligence, circuit analysis and active learning (AL). SetupKit integrates three key innovations: BEIRA, a bias-enhanced interpolation search derived from statistical error modeling to accelerate convergence by overcoming stagnation issues, initial search interval estimation by circuit analysis and AL strategy using Gaussian Process. This AL component intelligently learns PVT-timing correlations, actively guiding the expensive simulations to the most informative corners, thus minimizing redundancy in multicorner characterization. Evaluated on industrial 22nm standard cells across 16 PVT corners, SetupKit demonstrates a significant 2.4x overall CPU time reduction (from 720 to 290 days on a single core) compared to standard practices, drastically cutting characterization time. SetupKit offers a principled, learningbased approach to library characterization, addressing a critical EDA challenge and paving the way for more intelligent simulation management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual process of interpreting RTL code and writing specifications is slow and error-prone, and there is a need for more efficient automated methods to support increasingly complex IC design.

Method: The authors analyze prompting strategies for RTL-to-spec generation, introduce evaluation metrics for quality assessment, and benchmark various LLMs (both open-source and commercial) for this task.

Result: New insights are provided into effective prompting techniques, reliable evaluation metrics are introduced, and performance benchmarks for different LLMs are established.

Conclusion: The findings set a foundation for developing more automated and accurate IC design specification workflows, reducing human errors and improving efficiency.

Abstract: As IC design grows more complex, automating comprehension and documentation of RTL code has become increasingly important. Engineers currently should manually interpret existing RTL code and write specifications, a slow and error-prone process. Although LLMs have been studied for generating RTL from specifications, automated specification generation remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of reliable evaluation methods. To address this gap, we investigate how prompting strategies affect RTL-to-specification quality and introduce metrics for faithfully evaluating generated specs. We also benchmark open-source and commercial LLMs, providing a foundation for more automated and efficient specification workflows in IC design.

Conclusion: The new design successfully improves resource utilization, scalability, and throughput for mixed-precision operations on open-source GPUs.

Abstract: Efficient mixed-precision MMA operations are critical for accelerating Deep Learning workloads on GPGPUs. However, existing open-source RTL implementations of inner dot products rely on discrete arithmetic units, leading to suboptimal throughput and poor resource utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable mixed-precision dot product unit that integrates floating-point and integer arithmetic pipelines within a singular fused architecture, implemented as part of the open-source RISC-V based Vortex GPGPU's Tensor Core Unit extension. Our design supports low-precision multiplication in (FP16/BF16/FP8/BF8/INT8/UINT4) formats and higher-precision accumulation in (FP32/INT32), with an extensible framework for adding and evaluating other custom representations in the future. Experimental results demonstrate 4-cycle operation latency at 306.6 MHz clock frequency on the AMD Xilinx Alveo U55C FPGA, delivering an ideal filled pipeline throughput of 9.812 GFLOPS in a 4-thread per warp configuration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The substantial memory requirements of LLMs challenge existing memory system designs during inference, motivating the need for an efficient solution to optimize LLC architectures in GPUs and AI accelerators.

Method: The LLaMCAT framework integrates Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling. It also utilizes a hybrid simulation framework combining analytical models and cycle-level simulators to address performance optimization challenges.

Result: Experiments revealed that LLaMCAT achieved a speedup of 1.26x in scenarios limited by miss handling throughput, and 1.58x when the cache size was constrained, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: LLaMCAT effectively resolves MSHR contention for LLM inference, offering a practical and impactful solution for future hardware designs optimized for LLM decoding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success across various applications, but their substantial memory requirements pose significant challenges to current memory system designs, especially during inference. Our work targets last-level cache (LLC) based architectures, including GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs) and AI accelerators. We introduce LLaMCAT, a novel approach to optimize the LLC for LLM inference. LLaMCAT combines Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling to address stringent bandwidth demands and minimize cache stalls in KV Cache access. We also propose a hybrid simulation framework integrating analytical models with cycle-level simulators via memory traces, balancing architecture detail and efficiency.
  Experiments demonstrate that LLaMCAT achieves an average speedup of 1.26x when the system is mainly bottlenecked by miss handling throughput, while baselines mostly show negative improvements since they are not optimized for this scenario. When the cache size is also limited, our policy achieves a speedup of 1.58x over the unoptimized version, and a 1.26x improvement over the best baseline (dyncta). Overall, LLaMCAT is the first to target LLM decoding-specific MSHR contention, a gap in previous work. It presents a practical solution for accelerating LLM inference on future hardware platforms.

TL;DR: This paper introduces KAN-SAs, a novel Systolic Array (SA)-based accelerator designed for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), improving efficiency and utilization over conventional SA architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the use of Systolic Array (SA)-based architectures for accelerating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) due to existing challenges with B-splines in KANs and limitations in SA efficiency for this purpose.

Method: The authors develop KAN-SAs, which incorporate non-recursive B-spline implementations and leverage the sparsity of KANs, tailoring SAs for efficient KAN inference.

Result: KAN-SAs achieve up to 100% utilization of the Systolic Array and reduce clock cycle requirements by up to 50% compared to traditional SA designs with equivalent area.

Conclusion: KAN-SAs significantly enhance the efficiency of KAN inference while supporting flexibility for conventional DNNs, offering a promising hardware accelerator advancement.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered significant attention for their promise of improved parameter efficiency and explainability compared to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). KANs' key innovation lies in the use of learnable non-linear activation functions, which are parametrized as splines. Splines are expressed as a linear combination of basis functions (B-splines). B-splines prove particularly challenging to accelerate due to their recursive definition. Systolic Array (SA)based architectures have shown great promise as DNN accelerators thanks to their energy efficiency and low latency. However, their suitability and efficiency in accelerating KANs have never been assessed. Thus, in this work, we explore the use of SA architecture to accelerate the KAN inference. We show that, while SAs can be used to accelerate part of the KAN inference, their utilization can be reduced to 30%. Hence, we propose KAN-SAs, a novel SA-based accelerator that leverages intrinsic properties of B-splines to enable efficient KAN inference. By including a nonrecursive B-spline implementation and leveraging the intrinsic KAN sparsity, KAN-SAs enhances conventional SAs, enabling efficient KAN inference, in addition to conventional DNNs. KAN-SAs achieves up to 100% SA utilization and up to 50% clock cycles reduction compared to conventional SAs of equivalent area, as shown by hardware synthesis results on a 28nm FD-SOI technology. We also evaluate different configurations of the accelerator on various KAN applications, confirming the improved efficiency of KAN inference provided by KAN-SAs.

*Swastik Bhattacharya,Sanjay Das,Anand Menon,Shamik Kundu,Arnab Raha,Kanad Basu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of hardware fault tolerance in Floating-Point Compute-in-Memory (FP-CiM) architectures used in precision-sensitive AI applications, proposing the SafeCiM design to mitigate fault impacts significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of DNNs and LLMs necessitates efficient parameter handling, but traditional accelerators face data-transmission bottlenecks. Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures reduce these bottlenecks, yet the vulnerability of Floating-Point CiM to hardware faults is a critical, underexplored issue.

Method: The authors introduce systematic fault analysis in FP-CiM architectures by simulating bit-flip faults at key computational stages (digital multipliers, CiM memory cells, and adder trees). They evaluate the fault impact on inference accuracy using deep learning models like AlexNet and LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B and Qwen-0.3B. Based on findings, they propose SafeCiM, a fault-resilient FP-CiM architecture.

Result: The fault analysis shows that faults, particularly at adder stages, can severely degrade accuracy (e.g., to 0% in some LLM cases). SafeCiM demonstrates a 49x reduction in accuracy degradation due to adder faults compared to baseline FP-CiM, ensuring far greater resilience.

Conclusion: SafeCiM effectively enhances the fault resilience of FP-CiM architectures, addressing critical reliability concerns for mission-critical AI applications. The proposed design significantly suppresses accuracy loss from hardware faults, making it a robust choice for precision-sensitive tasks.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) continue to grow in complexity with Large Language Models (LLMs) incorporating vast numbers of parameters. Handling these parameters efficiently in traditional accelerators is limited by data-transmission bottlenecks, motivating Compute-in-Memory (CiM) architectures that integrate computation within or near memory to reduce data movement. Recent work has explored CiM designs using Floating-Point (FP) and Integer (INT) operations. FP computations typically deliver higher output quality due to their wider dynamic range and precision, benefiting precision-sensitive Generative AI applications. These include models such as LLMs, thus driving advancements in FP-CiM accelerators. However, the vulnerability of FP-CiM to hardware faults remains underexplored, posing a major reliability concern in mission-critical settings. To address this gap, we systematically analyze hardware fault effects in FP-CiM by introducing bit-flip faults at key computational stages, including digital multipliers, CiM memory cells, and digital adder trees. Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as AlexNet and state-of-the-art LLMs including LLaMA-3.2-1B and Qwen-0.3B-Base reveal how faults at each stage affect inference accuracy. Notably, a single adder fault can reduce LLM accuracy to 0%. Based on these insights, we propose a fault-resilient design, SafeCiM, that mitigates fault impact far better than a naive FP-CiM with a pre-alignment stage. For example, with 4096 MAC units, SafeCiM reduces accuracy degradation by up to 49x for a single adder fault compared to the baseline FP-CiM architecture.

Motivation: To improve the efficiency and speed of converting analog circuit layouts into procedural layout generators by leveraging reusable resources effectively.

Method: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed to detect sub-cells from a circuit layout that can be generated using available scripts, and to make suggestions for placement in the generator software hierarchy.

Result: The CNN model analyzed 4,885 sub-cell instances, classified 145 designs into 51 generatable and 1 not-generatable class with 99.3% precision, and reduced examination time from 88 minutes to 18 seconds.

Conclusion: The proposed approach automates sub-cell generation classification with very high precision, improves efficiency significantly, and handles unfamiliar sub-cells effectively.

Abstract: We propose a technique to assist in converting a reference layout of an analog circuit into the procedural layout generator by efficiently reusing available generators for sub-cell creation. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model automatically detects sub-cells that can be generated by available generator scripts in the library, and suggests using them in the hierarchically correct places of the generator software. In experiments, the CNN model examined sub-cells of a high-speed wireline receiver that has a total of 4,885 sub-cell instances including different 145 sub-cell designs. The CNN model classified the sub-cell instances into 51 generatable and one not-generatable classes. One not-generatable class indicates that no available generator can generate the classified sub-cell. The CNN model achieved 99.3% precision in examining the 145 different sub-cell designs. The CNN model greatly reduced the examination time to 18 seconds from 88 minutes required in manual examination. Also, the proposed CNN model could correctly classify unfamiliar sub-cells that are very different from the training dataset.

In this paper, we propose InF-ATPG, an intelligent FFR-driven ATPG framework that overcomes these challenges by using advanced circuit representation to guide RL. By partitioning circuits into fanout-free regions (FFRs) and incorporating ATPG-specific features into a novel QGNN architecture, InF-ATPG enhances test pattern generation efficiency.

Abstract: Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a promising computing paradigm to address the memory wall and the fundamental bottleneck of the von Neumann architecture by reducing costly data movement between memory and processing units. As with any engineering challenge, identifying the most effective solutions requires thorough exploration of diverse architectural proposals, device technologies, and application domains. In this context, simulation plays a critical role in enabling researchers to evaluate, compare, and refine PIM designs prior to fabrication. Over the past decade, a variety of PIM simulators have been introduced, spanning low-level device models, architectural frameworks, and application-oriented environments. These tools differ significantly in fidelity, scalability, supported memory/compute technologies, and benchmark compatibility. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for researchers to select appropriate simulators that accurately map and validate their research efforts. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of PIM simulation methodologies and tools. We categorize simulators according to abstraction levels, design objectives, and evaluation metrics, highlighting representative examples. To improve accessibility, some content may appear in multiple contexts to guide readers with different backgrounds. We also survey benchmark suites commonly employed in PIM studies and discuss open challenges in simulation methodology, paving the way for more reliable, scalable, and efficient PIM modeling.

### [88] [An Analytical and Empirical Investigation of Tag Partitioning for Energy-Efficient Reliable Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00112)
*Elham Cheshmikhani,Hamed Farbeh*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the optimization of tag partitioning in cache memory design, presenting a mathematical formulation to determine the optimal splitting point (k) to improve energy efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance processor performance and energy efficiency while addressing reliability challenges in cache memory, especially focusing on the critical tag array component.

Method: The authors derive an analytical, convex, and differentiable formulation to determine the optimal tag-partitioning splitting point (k) based on cache configuration parameters, supported by experimental validation.

Result: The proposed formulation effectively determines the optimal k for various cache configurations, with analytical results closely aligning with experimental data, ensuring significant energy savings and reliability improvements.

Conclusion: The approach provides a precise, generalizable method for selecting the optimal tag-splitting point, offering substantial benefits for both cache memory design and overall system performance.

Abstract: Associative cache memory significantly influences processor performance and energy consumption. Because it occupies over half of the chip area, cache memory is highly susceptible to transient and permanent faults, posing reliability challenges. As the only hardware-managed memory module, the cache tag array is the most active and critical component, dominating both energy usage and error rate. Tag partitioning is a widely used technique to reduce tag-access energy and enhance reliability. It divides tag comparison into two phases: first comparing the k lower bits, and then activating only the matching tag entries to compare the remaining higher bits. The key design parameter is the selection of the tag-splitting point k, which determines how many reads are eliminated. However, prior studies have chosen k intuitively, randomly, or empirically, without justification. Even experimentally determined values are ad-hoc and do not generalize across cache configurations due to high sensitivity to architectural parameters.
  In this paper, we analytically show that choosing k too large or too small substantially reduces the effectiveness of tag partitioning. We then derive a formulation that determines the optimal splitting point based on cache configuration parameters. The formulation is convex, differentiable, and capable of precisely quantifying tag-partitioning efficiency for any k and configuration. To validate our model, we experimentally evaluate tag-partitioning efficiency and optimal k across a broad set of cache designs and demonstrate close agreement between analytical and experimental results. The proposed formulation enables designers and researchers to instantly compute the optimal tag-splitting point and accurately estimate tag-read reduction.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper discusses the architectural principles of digital neuromorphic processors for EdgeAI, using the SENECA platform as a detailed example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive understanding and architectural perspective of digital neuromorphic processors, focusing on design trade-offs and system evolution for low-power EdgeAI applications.

Method: This tutorial elaborates on progressive architectural developments of digital neuromorphic processors, focusing on the SENECA platform, starting from RISC-V cores and improving incrementally with a Network-on-Chip, Neural Processing Elements, and software techniques like spike grouping.

Result: The paper synthesizes previous findings from SENECA publications and organizes them as a cohesive design guideline. This aids in understanding the trade-offs and flexibility in domain-specific acceleration for neuromorphic systems.

Conclusion: The paper acts as a guide for students and practitioners, emphasizing the design, energy efficiency, and trade-offs of neuromorphic processors, rather than introducing novel experimental results.

Abstract: Digital neuromorphic processors are emerging as a promising computing substrate for low-power, always-on EdgeAI applications. In this tutorial paper, we outline the main architectural design principles behind fully digital neuromorphic processors and illustrate them using the SENECA platform as a running example. Starting from a flexible array of tiny RISC-V processing cores connected by a simple Network-on-Chip (NoC), we show how to progressively evolve the architecture: from a baseline event-driven implementation of fully connected networks, to versions with dedicated Neural Processing Elements (NPEs) and a loop controller that offloads fine-grained control from the general-purpose cores. Along the way, we discuss software and mapping techniques such as spike grouping, event-driven depth-first convolution for convolutional networks, and hard-attention style processing for high-resolution event-based vision. The focus is on architectural trade-offs, performance and energy bottlenecks, and on leveraging flexibility to incrementally add domain-specific acceleration. This paper assumes familiarity with basic neuromorphic concepts (spikes, event-driven computation, sparse activation) and deep neural network workloads. It does not present new experimental results; instead, it synthesizes and contextualizes findings previously reported in our SENECA publications to provide a coherent, step-by-step architectural perspective for students and practitioners who wish to design their own digital neuromorphic processors.

### [91] [Variable Point: A Number Format for Area- and Energy-Efficient Multiplication of High-Dynamic-Range Numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00186)
*Seyed Hadi Mirfarshbafan,Nicolas Filliol,Oscar Castañeda,Christoph Studer*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a variable-point (VP) number format, offering a broader dynamic range than fixed-point numbers without significant hardware overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fixed-point number formats have limitations in dynamic range for hardware-efficient VLSI designs, while floating-point formats are too complex for some applications, creating a need for an alternative.

Method: The authors propose and implement a variable-point (VP) number format and evaluate its efficiency through a matrix-vector multiplication engine used in multi-antenna wireless communication systems.

Result: The VP-based design achieves 20% area savings and 10% power savings compared to a fixed-point design, with no noticeable performance drop in a VLSI implementation.

Conclusion: The VP number format offers an efficient alternative to fixed-point formats, combining a larger dynamic range with hardware efficiency, showcasing its potential in high-dynamic-range signal applications.

Abstract: Fixed-point number representation is commonly employed in digital VLSI designs that have stringent hardware efficiency constraints. However, fixed-point numbers cover a relatively small dynamic range for a given bitwidth. In contrast, floating-point numbers offer a larger dynamic range at the cost of increased hardware complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel number format called variable-point (VP). VP numbers cover a larger dynamic range than fixed-point numbers with similar bitwidth, without notably increasing hardware complexity -- this allows for a more efficient representation of signals with high dynamic range. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed VP number format, we consider a matrix-vector multiplication engine for spatial equalization in multi-antenna wireless communication systems involving high-dynamic-range signals. Through post-layout VLSI implementation results, we demonstrate that the proposed VP-based design achieves 20% and 10% area and power savings, respectively, compared to a fully optimized fixed-point design, without incurring any noticeable performance degradation.

*Takuto Ando,Yu Eto,Ayumu Takeuchi,Yasuhiko Nakashima*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This study evaluates the energy-efficient use of Coarse-Grained Linear Arrays (CGLAs) for Large Language Model (LLM) inference, highlighting significant gains in power efficiency compared to GPUs, despite latency compromises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the high energy consumption of LLM inference on GPUs by exploring alternative architectures, specifically Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs), which balance energy efficiency and programmability.

Method: The research evaluates a non-AI-specific CGLA accelerator with flexible instruction sets for LLM inference using an FPGA prototype and projects its performance as a 28nm ASIC against NVIDIA GPUs.

Result: The CGLA accelerator demonstrated substantial energy efficiency improvements, achieving up to 44.4x better Power-Delay Product and 11.5x better Energy-Delay Product compared to high-performance GPUs.

Conclusion: CGRAs are validated as viable platforms for energy-efficient LLM inference, providing design insights for future sustainable accelerator architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demand substantial computational resources, resulting in high energy consumption on GPUs. To address this challenge, we focus on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) as an effective alternative that provides a trade-off between energy efficiency and programmability. This paper presents the first comprehensive, end-to-end evaluation of a non-AI-specialized Coarse-Grained Linear Array (CGLA) accelerator for the state-of-the-art Qwen LLM family. The architecture has a general-purpose, task-agnostic design, yet its flexible instruction set allows for domain-specific adaptations. This flexibility enables the architecture to achieve high efficiency for sustainable LLM inference. We assess the performance of our architecture on an FPGA prototype using the widely adopted llama.cpp framework. We then project its potential as a 28nm ASIC and compare it against a high-performance GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090) and an edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin). While GPUs exhibit lower latency, our non-AI-specific accelerator achieves higher energy efficiency, improving the Power-Delay Product (PDP) by up to 44.4x and 13.6x compared with the RTX 4090 and Jetson, respectively. Similarly, it reduces the Energy-Delay Product (EDP) by up to 11.5x compared to the high-performance GPU, demonstrating a favorable performance-energy trade-off. Critically, our system-level analysis identifies host-accelerator data transfer as the primary performance bottleneck, a factor often overlooked in kernel-level studies. These findings provide design guidance for next-generation LLM accelerators. This work validates CGRAs as a suitable platform for LLM inference in power-constrained environments, without being confined to specific algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed 8T SRAM-based IMC architecture demonstrates improved reliability and efficiency for advanced in-memory computing tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-memory computing (IMC) architecture developed on an 8x8 array of 8T SRAM cells. This architecture enables both multi-bit parallel Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and standard memory processing through charge-sharing on dedicated read bit-lines. By leveraging the maturity of SRAM technology, this work introduces an 8T SRAM-based IMC architecture that decouples read and write paths, thereby overcoming the reliability limitations of prior 6T SRAM designs. A novel analog-to-digital decoding scheme converts the MAC voltage output into digital counts, which are subsequently interpreted to realize fundamental logic functions including AND/NAND, NOR/OR, XOR/XNOR, and 1-bit addition within the same array. Simulated in a 90 nm CMOS process at 1.8 V supply voltage, the proposed design achieves 8-bit MAC and logical operations at a frequency of 142.85 MHz, with a latency of 0.7 ns and energy consumption of 56.56 fJ/bit per MAC operation and throughput of 15.8 M operations/s.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of low code density and reliance on proprietary toolchains in soft-core processors for resource-constrained FGPA platforms.

Method: The microprocessor uses a dual-stack architecture inspired by WebAssembly (WASM) ISA, runs directly from SPI Flash (XIP mechanism), and is implemented using entirely open-source tools.

Result: The processor utilizes 80% logic resources, operates at 27 MHz, and executes simple applications reliably, demonstrating effective performance on resource-constrained FPGAs.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture achieves a balance between resource utilization, performance, and code density while improving transparency and portability through an open-source approach.

Abstract: Soft-core processors on resource-constrained FPGAs often suffer from low code density and reliance on proprietary toolchains. This paper details the design, implementation, and evaluation of a 32-bit dual-stack microprocessor architecture optimized for low-cost, resource-constrained Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Implemented on the Gowin GW1NR-9 (Tang Nano 9K), the processor utilizes an instruction set architecture (ISA) inspired from a subset of the WebAssembly (WASM) specification to achieve high code density. Unlike traditional soft-cores that often rely on proprietary vendor toolchains and opaque IP blocks, this design is synthesized and routed utilizing an open-source flow, providing transparency and portability. The architecture features a dual-stack model (Data and Return), executing directly from SPI Flash via an Execute-in-Place (XIP) mechanism to conserve scarce Block RAM on the intended target device. An analysis of the trade-offs involved in stack depth parametrization is presented, demonstrating that an 8-entry distributed RAM implementation provides a balance between logic resource utilization ($\sim 80\%$) and routing congestion. Furthermore, timing hazards in single-cycle stack operations are identified and resolved through a refined Finite State Machine (FSM) design. The system achieves a stable operating frequency of 27 MHz, limited by Flash latency, and successfully executes simple applications including a single and multi-digit infix calculator.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in existing ReRAM-based graph accelerators, such as memristor access overheads caused by frequent graph partitioning, which result in higher energy consumption, slower speeds, and reduced circuit lifespan.

Method: The proposed approach identifies frequent subgraph patterns and assigns them to specific graph engines to minimize memristor write operations, reducing the need for crossbar reconfigurations.

Result: The method achieves up to 2.38x speedup, 7.23x energy savings, and extends circuit lifetime by 2x compared to current graph accelerators.

Conclusion: This method enhances the overall efficiency and longevity of ReRAM-based graph accelerators by improving computational performance and reducing operational costs.

Abstract: Graph accelerators have emerged as a promising solution for processing large-scale sparse graphs, leveraging the in-situ compu-tation of ReRAM-based crossbars to maximize computational efficiency. However, existing designs suffer from memristor access overhead due to the large number of graph partitions. This leads to increased execution time, higher energy consumption, and re-duced circuit lifetime. This paper proposes a graph processing method that minimizes memristor write operations by identifying frequent subgraph patterns and assigning them to graph engines, referred to as static, allowing most subgraphs to be processed without a need for crossbar reconfiguration. Experimental results show speed up to 2.38x speedup and 7.23x energy savings com-pared to state-of-the-art accelerators. Furthermore, our method extends the circuit lifetime by 2x compared to state-of-the-art ReRAM graph accelerators.

*Hwayong Nam,Seungmin Baek,Jumin Kim,Michael Jaemin Kim,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: RoMe simplifies HBM-based memory architectures by enabling row-granularity memory access, reducing inefficiencies related to current fine-grained accesses and improving bandwidth by 12.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HBM-based memory systems lack efficiency when handling large data transfers necessary for deep learning workloads, as they require intricate scheduling and excessive fragmentation at a fine-grained cache line access level.

Method: The proposed RoMe design removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface, allowing for row-granularity access and aggregating freed pins into additional channels to increase bandwidth by 12.5%.

Result: The RoMe memory design leads to simplified scheduling logic for large language model workloads and increases overall memory bandwidth with minimal hardware adjustments.

Conclusion: RoMe offers an efficient alternative for next-generation HBM-based memory systems, optimizing bandwidth and reducing complexities in scheduling logic while incurring minimal hardware costs.

Abstract: Modern HBM-based memory systems have evolved over generations while retaining cache line granularity accesses. Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency.
  To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead.

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can automate inductive coding in qualitative data analysis, highlighting performance differences between humans and LLMs and their label alignment accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency of qualitative data analysis by automating inductive coding, moving beyond traditional deductive methods.

Method: The study compared the performance of six open-source LLMs to human experts in inductive coding and incorporated systematic evaluation, including expert ratings on task difficulty and alignment with a golden standard.

Result: The study found humans excel in labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs show the opposite trend. Human labels often deviate from the golden standard but are rated higher by humans, whereas LLMs align better yet receive lower evaluations.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for qualitative data analysis, showing strengths and weaknesses relative to humans, but still need refinement for broader acceptance and application.

Abstract: This paper investigates the automation of qualitative data analysis, focusing on inductive coding using large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on deductive methods with predefined labels, this research investigates the inductive process where labels emerge from the data. The study evaluates the performance of six open-source LLMs compared to human experts. As part of the evaluation, experts rated the perceived difficulty of the quotes they coded. The results reveal a peculiar dichotomy: human coders consistently perform well when labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs exhibit the opposite trend. Additionally, the study explores systematic deviations in both human and LLM generated labels by comparing them to the golden standard from the test set. While human annotations may sometimes differ from the golden standard, they are often rated more favorably by other humans. In contrast, some LLMs demonstrate closer alignment with the true labels but receive lower evaluations from experts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) coordinate in multi-agent discussions, introducing metrics to track dynamics and revealing emergent strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand coordination dynamics among LLMs when treated as black-box agents in collaborative scenarios.

Method: Simulated 7500 multi-agent discussions using inductive coding tasks, analyzed metrics like stability, self-consistency, and embedding geometry.

Result: LLM groups exhibited semantic and lexical convergence, asymmetric influence patterns, and compression over interaction rounds.

Conclusion: Black-box interaction analysis surfaces emergent coordination strategies in LLMs, complementing probe-based interpretability techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in collaborative settings, yet little is known about how they coordinate when treated as black-box agents. We simulate 7500 multi-agent, multi-round discussions in an inductive coding task, generating over 125000 utterances that capture both final annotations and their interactional histories. We introduce process-level metrics: code stability, semantic self-consistency, and lexical confidence alongside sentiment and convergence measures, to track coordination dynamics. To probe deeper alignment signals, we analyze the evolving geometry of output embeddings, showing that intrinsic dimensionality declines over rounds, suggesting semantic compression. The results reveal that LLM groups converge lexically and semantically, develop asymmetric influence patterns, and exhibit negotiation-like behaviors despite the absence of explicit role prompting. This work demonstrates how black-box interaction analysis can surface emergent coordination strategies, offering a scalable complement to internal probe-based interpretability methods.

### [101] [Tree Matching Networks for Natural Language Inference: Parameter-Efficient Semantic Understanding via Dependency Parse Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00204)
*Jason Lunder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Tree Matching Networks (TMN) based on dependency parse trees for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, demonstrating better results and efficiency compared to BERT models on specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-parameter transformer models, like BERT, are effective for NLI but computationally expensive. Exploring linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may improve efficiency and performance.

Method: Adaptation of Graph Matching Networks to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN) and comparison with BERT-based models on SNLI and SemEval tasks.

Result: TMN achieves better results than BERT with reduced memory and training time on SNLI, but both models performed poorly on SemEval. Explicit structural representations show promise but face scalability challenges.

Conclusion: TMN effectively leverages linguistic structures for NLI tasks, outperforming sequence models at smaller scales, but scalability issues need addressing. Multi-headed attention aggregation is proposed as a solution to these limitations.

Abstract: In creating sentence embeddings for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, using transformer-based models like BERT leads to high accuracy, but require hundreds of millions of parameters. These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability. We propose multi-headed attention aggregation to address this limitation.

*Matej Klemen,Tjaša Arčon,Luka Terčon,Marko Robnik-Šikonja,Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses using large language models (LLMs) for automated grammatical analysis of annotated corpora by introducing an agentic framework. It demonstrates feasibility through experiments with Universal Dependencies and multilingual word-order tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce the methodological and technical complexity of analyzing annotated corpora in empirical grammar research by leveraging modern data-driven tools.

Method: The authors propose an agentic framework that combines natural language task interpretation, code generation, and data-driven reasoning. They applied the framework to UD corpora and tested it on multilingual grammatical tasks inspired by linguistic features in WALS.

Result: The evaluation covered 13 word-order features across over 170 languages. The system was assessed on dominant-order accuracy, order-coverage completeness, and distributional fidelity, achieving promising results.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for integrating LLM reasoning with structured linguistic datasets to automate corpus-based grammatical research in an interpretable and scalable way.

Abstract: Empirical grammar research has become increasingly data-driven, but the systematic analysis of annotated corpora still requires substantial methodological and technical effort. We explore how agentic large language models (LLMs) can streamline this process by reasoning over annotated corpora and producing interpretable, data-grounded answers to linguistic questions. We introduce an agentic framework for corpus-grounded grammatical analysis that integrates concepts such as natural-language task interpretation, code generation, and data-driven reasoning. As a proof of concept, we apply it to Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora, testing it on multilingual grammatical tasks inspired by the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS). The evaluation spans 13 word-order features and over 170 languages, assessing system performance across three complementary dimensions - dominant-order accuracy, order-coverage completeness, and distributional fidelity - which reflect how well the system generalizes, identifies, and quantifies word-order variations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combining LLM reasoning with structured linguistic data, offering a first step toward interpretable, scalable automation of corpus-based grammatical inquiry.

### [103] [Minimal-Edit Instruction Tuning for Low-Resource Indic GEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00219)
*Akhil Rajeev P*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an augmentation-free setup using instruction-tuned large language models for grammatical error correction (GEC) in Indic languages. It achieves competitive results by leveraging classifier-designed prompts, efficient fine-tuning, and conservative decoding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenges of grammatical error correction for Indic languages, including limited data, diverse scripts, and complex morphology.

Method: The methodology includes instruction-tuning a 12B GEMMA 3 model with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in 4-bit precision. It uses a deterministic error classifier to design prompts and performs deterministic, conservative decoding with a lightweight normalizer.

Result: The system scored 92.41 on Malayalam (6th overall) and 81.44 on Hindi (3rd overall) under the official untuned GLEU evaluation, demonstrating computationally efficient and reproducible performance.

Conclusion: Classifier-informed prompts, instruction tuning, and deterministic decoding offer a strong alternative for Indic GEC without augmentation. The approach also highlights areas for future improvements, such as enforcing stronger morphosyntactic constraints and conducting human-centered evaluations.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction for Indic languages faces limited supervision, diverse scripts, and rich morphology. We propose an augmentation-free setup that uses instruction-tuned large language models and conservative decoding. A 12B GEMMA 3 model is instruction-tuned in bnb 4-bit precision with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and Alpaca-style formatting. Decoding follows a deterministic, constraint-aware procedure with a lightweight normaliser that encourages minimal, meaning-preserving edits. We operationalise inference, subsequent to instruction fine-tuning (IFT), via a fixed, language-specific prompt directly synthesised from a deterministic error classifier's taxonomy, label distributions, and precedence ordering computed on the training corpus.
  Under the official untuned GLEU evaluation, the system scores 92.41 on Malayalam, sixth overall, and 81.44 on Hindi, third overall. These results indicate that classifier-informed prompt design, adapter-based instruction tuning, and deterministic decoding provide a reproducible and a computationally efficient alternative to augmentation-centred pipelines for Indic GEC. The approach also motivates future work on stronger morphosyntactic constraints and human-centred evaluation of conservative edits.

### [104] [OmniFusion: Simultaneous Multilingual Multimodal Translations via Modular Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00234)
*Sai Koneru,Matthias Huck,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniFusion, an end-to-end multimodal translation system combining multimodal foundation models and language models for improved speech translation quality and reduced latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current translation approaches rely on cascaded pipelines, causing latency issues and lack multimodal support, which limits context utilization for better translation outcomes.

Method: The authors propose OmniFusion by fusing hidden states between a multimodal foundation model (Omni 2.5-7B) and a translation-focused LLM (SeedX PPO-7B), enabling end-to-end joint training.

Result: OmniFusion reduces speech translation latency by 1 second in simultaneous speech translation and leverages multimodal inputs to improve translation quality.

Conclusion: End-to-end multimodal systems like OmniFusion can outperform traditional speech translation pipelines and address limitations in latency and multimodal context utilization.

Abstract: There has been significant progress in open-source text-only translation large language models (LLMs) with better language coverage and quality. However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion}.

### [105] [Lost without translation -- Can transformer (language models) understand mood states?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00274)
*Prakrithi Shivaprakash,Diptadhi Mukherjee,Lekhansh Shukla,Animesh Mukherjee,Prabhat Chand,Pratima Murthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studied the ability of large language models to represent mood states from Indic languages using various embedding and translation methods. Translation-based approaches performed better than direct embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of language models being predominantly English-centric and their inability to represent idioms of distress in diverse local languages, particularly in psychiatric applications.

Method: The study analyzed representations of 247 phrases from Indian languages across four mood states using seven experimental conditions comparing direct embeddings and translation-based embeddings.

Result: Direct Indic embeddings failed to cluster mood states, whereas translation-based embeddings significantly improved performance. Translations into English and Chinese embedded with specific models scored the highest.

Conclusion: Current models fail to represent mood states in Indic languages directly, highlighting the need for models capable of understanding diverse local languages to advance global mental health applications sustainably.

Abstract: Background: Large Language Models show promise in psychiatry but are English-centric. Their ability to understand mood states in other languages is unclear, as different languages have their own idioms of distress. Aim: To quantify the ability of language models to faithfully represent phrases (idioms of distress) of four distinct mood states (depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, dysphoric mania) expressed in Indian languages. Methods: We collected 247 unique phrases for the four mood states across 11 Indic languages. We tested seven experimental conditions, comparing k-means clustering performance on: (a) direct embeddings of native and Romanised scripts (using multilingual and Indic-specific models) and (b) embeddings of phrases translated to English and Chinese. Performance was measured using a composite score based on Adjusted Rand Index, Normalised Mutual Information, Homogeneity and Completeness. Results: Direct embedding of Indic languages failed to cluster mood states (Composite Score = 0.002). All translation-based approaches showed significant improvement. High performance was achieved using Gemini-translated English (Composite=0.60) and human-translated English (Composite=0.61) embedded with gemini-001. Surprisingly, human-translated English, further translated into Chinese and embedded with a Chinese model, performed best (Composite = 0.67). Specialised Indic models (IndicBERT and Sarvam-M) performed poorly. Conclusion: Current models cannot meaningfully represent mood states directly from Indic languages, posing a fundamental barrier to their psychiatric application for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in India. While high-quality translation bridges this gap, reliance on proprietary models or complex translation pipelines is unsustainable. Models must first be built to understand diverse local languages to be effective in global mental health.

*Xabier de Zuazo,Ibon Saratxaga,Eva Navas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors developed Conformer-based decoders for MEG signal analysis, achieving top-10 results in the 2025 LibriBrain PNPL competition for Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to build accurate computational models for analyzing MEG signals in speech detection and phoneme classification, leveraging Conformer architectures to tackle these challenging tasks.

Method: A compact Conformer model was adapted to 306-channel raw MEG signals. Task-specific techniques include MEG-based SpecAugment for Speech Detection and inverse-square-root class weighting combined with a dynamic grouping loader for Phoneme Classification. Instance-level normalization was also implemented to handle distributional shifts.

Result: Their models achieved F1-macro scores of 88.9% for Speech Detection and 65.8% for Phoneme Classification, exceeding competition baselines and securing top-10 rankings in both tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully improve MEG-based task performance, making strides in speech analysis using MEG signals. The availability of technical details and code ensures reproducibility.

Abstract: We present Conformer-based decoders for the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL competition, targeting two foundational MEG tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks.

*Guoqing Ma,Jia Zhu,Hanghui Guo,Weijie Shi,Yue Cui,Jiawei Shen,Zilong Li,Yidan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduEval is a hierarchical benchmark developed to evaluate LLMs within Chinese K-12 education across six cognitive dimensions, comprising 24 tasks and over 11,000 questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address risks posed by unsupervised deployment of LLMs in education, emphasizing the need for rigorous evaluation to ensure alignment with educational standards.

Method: The authors introduce EduEval, a benchmark combining Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge to assess LLMs on various cognitive dimensions using real-world educational content.

Result: EduEval evaluated 14 LLMs, revealing challenges in classroom dialogue classification and inconsistent performance in creative content generation, with some open source models surpassing proprietary ones on complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Tailored approaches are necessary for optimizing LLMs in educational tasks, as cognitive dimensions show varying responsiveness to few-shot prompting and educational objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for educational applications. However, their unscrutinized deployment poses risks to educational standards, underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation. We introduce EduEval, a comprehensive hierarchical benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Chinese K-12 education. This benchmark makes three key contributions: (1) Cognitive Framework: We propose the EduAbility Taxonomy, which unifies Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge to organize tasks across six cognitive dimensions including Memorization, Understanding, Application, Reasoning, Creativity, and Ethics. (2) Authenticity: Our benchmark integrates real exam questions, classroom conversation, student essays, and expert-designed prompts to reflect genuine educational challenges; (3) Scale: EduEval comprises 24 distinct task types with over 11,000 questions spanning primary to high school levels. We evaluate 14 leading LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that while models perform well on factual tasks, they struggle with classroom dialogue classification and exhibit inconsistent results in creative content generation. Interestingly, several open source models outperform proprietary systems on complex educational reasoning. Few-shot prompting shows varying effectiveness across cognitive dimensions, suggesting that different educational objectives require tailored approaches. These findings provide targeted benchmarking metrics for developing LLMs specifically optimized for diverse Chinese educational tasks.

*Muhammad Muneeb,David B. Ascher,Ahsan Baidar Bakht*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates 47 context-based question answering models from Hugging Face on eight datasets, identifying the best-performing models without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and benchmark the best CBQA models that perform well on various datasets without retraining, reducing implementation overhead in real-world applications.

Method: 47 CBQA models were evaluated on eight datasets without fine-tuning, analyzing their performance, computation times, and factors influencing accuracy such as context length, model size, and answer length. Additionally, a Genetic algorithm was employed for performance improvement.

Result: Ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 emerged as the best-performing model overall with 43% accuracy across datasets, while other models also showed dataset-specific strengths.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into CBQA model performance and factors affecting it, facilitating efficient model selection for different practical applications.

Abstract: Context-based question answering (CBQA) models provide more accurate and relevant answers by considering the contextual information. They effectively extract specific information given a context, making them functional in various applications involving user support, information retrieval, and educational platforms. In this manuscript, we benchmarked the performance of 47 CBQA models from Hugging Face on eight different datasets. This study aims to identify the best-performing model across diverse datasets without additional fine-tuning. It is valuable for practical applications where the need to retrain models for specific datasets is minimized, streamlining the implementation of these models in various contexts. The best-performing models were trained on the SQuAD v2 or SQuAD v1 datasets. The best-performing model was ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512, which yielded 43\% accuracy across all datasets. We observed that the computation time of all models depends on the context length and the model size. The model's performance usually decreases with an increase in the answer length. Moreover, the model's performance depends on the context complexity. We also used the Genetic algorithm to improve the overall accuracy by integrating responses from other models. ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 generated the best results for bioasq10b-factoid (65.92\%), biomedical\_cpgQA (96.45\%), QuAC (11.13\%), and Question Answer Dataset (41.6\%). Bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad achieved an accuracy of 82\% on the IELTS dataset.

*Ashish Thanga,Vibhu Dixit,Abhilash Shankarampeta,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a SQL-based approach to temporal reasoning over evolving semi-structured tables, emphasizing schema design over model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QA systems struggle with temporal reasoning in semi-structured tables, so there is a need to improve precision in this domain.

Method: The method involves generating a 3NF schema from Wikipedia infoboxes, creating SQL queries, and executing those queries, with a focus on schema quality.

Result: The proposed configuration (Gemini 2.5 Flash schema + Gemini-2.0-Flash queries) achieves a significant improvement of 16.8%, reaching 80.39 EM compared to the baseline's 68.89 EM.

Conclusion: Schema design quality is more critical than model scaling for improving QA precision, supported by principles of normalization, semantic naming, and temporal anchoring.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over evolving semi-structured tables poses a challenge to current QA systems. We propose a SQL-based approach that involves (1) generating a 3NF schema from Wikipedia infoboxes, (2) generating SQL queries, and (3) query execution. Our central finding challenges model scaling assumptions: the quality of schema design has a greater impact on QA precision than model capacity. We establish three evidence-based principles: normalization that preserves context, semantic naming that reduces ambiguity, and consistent temporal anchoring. Our best configuration (Gemini 2.5 Flash schema + Gemini-2.0-Flash queries) achieves 80.39 EM, a 16.8\% improvement over the baseline (68.89 EM).

*Daud Waqas,Aaryamaan Golthi,Erika Hayashida,Huanzhi Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation method, A-CC, to measure the resilience of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn tool-assisted dialogues, revealing vulnerabilities to misleading assertions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust evaluation methods for multi-turn language model pipelines in safety-critical domains, where resilience to misleading assertions and system policies is essential.

Method: The authors propose Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), which evaluates LLMs on their ability to handle misleading user-source assertions (USAs) and function-source assertions (FSAs), testing sycophancy and adherence to contradictory policies.

Result: The study finds that current models exhibit significant vulnerabilities to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, proving a need for better robustness in deployed systems.

Conclusion: A-CC reveals that LLMs are not yet fully reliable for critical domains due to latent vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of improving multi-turn dialogue robustness.

Abstract: Multi-turn tool-calling LLMs (models capable of invoking external APIs or tools across several user turns) have emerged as a key feature in modern AI assistants, enabling extended dialogues from benign tasks to critical business, medical, and financial operations. Yet implementing multi-turn pipelines remains difficult for many safety-critical industries due to ongoing concerns regarding model resilience. While standardized benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) have underpinned confidence concerning advanced function-calling models (like Salesforce's xLAM V2), there is still a lack of visibility into multi-turn conversation-level robustness, especially given their exposure to real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), a novel evaluation paradigm for multi-turn function-calling dialogues. A-CC provides holistic metrics that evaluate a model's behavior when confronted with misleading assertions originating from two distinct vectors: (1) user-sourced assertions (USAs), which measure sycophancy toward plausible but misinformed user beliefs, and (2) function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which measure compliance with plausible but contradictory system policies (e.g., stale hints from unmaintained tools). Our results show that models are highly vulnerable to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, confirming A-CC as a critical, latent vulnerability in deployed agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IndicParam evaluates 11 low or extremely low-resource Indic languages with over 13,000 benchmark multiple-choice questions, where GPT-5 achieved 45% accuracy, revealing limitations in low-resource language processing. The dataset and scripts are publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of proper evaluation for low and extremely low-resource Indic languages in language models and provide a comprehensive benchmark for these languages.

Method: Developed a benchmark dataset (IndicParam) of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions for 11 languages. Evaluated the performance of 19 large language models across various question types and formats.

Result: GPT-5 performed best but only achieved 45% accuracy, followed by DeepSeek-3.2 (43.1%) and Claude-4.5 (42.7%), highlighting significant shortcomings in cross-lingual transfer for low-resource Indic languages.

Conclusion: IndicParam successfully identifies the limitations of language models in handling low-resource Indic languages, providing a benchmark that fosters further research in this domain.

Abstract: While large language models excel on high-resource multilingual tasks, low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages remain severely under-evaluated. We present IndicParam, a human-curated benchmark of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions covering 11 such languages (Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia as low-resource; Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani as extremely low-resource) plus Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. We evaluated 19 LLMs, both proprietary and open-weights, which reveals that even the top-performing GPT-5 reaches only 45.0% average accuracy, followed by DeepSeek-3.2 (43.1) and Claude-4.5 (42.7). We additionally label each question as knowledge-oriented or purely linguistic to discriminate factual recall from grammatical proficiency. Further, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. IndicParam provides insights into limitations of cross-lingual transfer and establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bharatgenai/IndicParam. Scripts to run benchmark are present at https://github.com/ayushbits/IndicParam.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CourseTimeQA for timestamped question answering in educational lecture videos and CrossFusion-RAG, a lightweight retriever achieving improved retrieval metrics and low latency on a single GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address timestamped question answering in educational videos under latency and memory constraints with effective retrieval and response generation.

Method: CourseTimeQA dataset is proposed alongside CrossFusion-RAG, a cross-modal retriever utilizing frozen encoders, learned vision projection, cross-attention over ASR/frames, temporal regularizer, and reranker, evaluated under constrained hardware.

Result: CrossFusion-RAG improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10 +0.10, MRR +0.08) over BLIP-2 retriever, achieving ~1.55 s median latency on single GPU while showing robustness against ASR noise and localization diagnostics.

Conclusion: The paper advances timestamped question answering by introducing an efficient retriever and demonstrating reproducible improvements over prior methods in constrained conditions.

Abstract: We study timestamped question answering over educational lecture videos under a single-GPU latency/memory budget. Given a natural-language query, the system retrieves relevant timestamped segments and synthesizes a grounded answer. We present CourseTimeQA (52.3 h, 902 queries across six courses) and a lightweight, latency-constrained cross-modal retriever (CrossFusion-RAG) that combines frozen encoders, a learned 512->768 vision projection, shallow query-agnostic cross-attention over ASR and frames with a temporal-consistency regularizer, and a small cross-attentive reranker. On CourseTimeQA, CrossFusion-RAG improves nDCG@10 by 0.10 and MRR by 0.08 over a strong BLIP-2 retriever while achieving approximately 1.55 s median end-to-end latency on a single A100. Closest comparators (zero-shot CLIP multi-frame pooling; CLIP + cross-encoder reranker + MMR; learned late-fusion gating; text-only hybrid with cross-encoder reranking and its MMR variant; caption-augmented text retrieval; non-learned temporal smoothing) are evaluated under matched hardware and indexing. We report robustness across ASR noise (WER quartiles), diagnostics for temporal localization, and full training/tuning details to support reproducible comparison.

*Nuo Chen,Hanpei Fang,Jiqun Liu,Wilson Wei,Tetsuya Sakai,Xiao-Ming Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how LLMs' simulated personalities, based on Big Five profiles, affect priming effects in relevance labeling and proposes 'personality prompting' as a mitigation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address priming biases in LLM-driven relevance labeling, understanding whether simulated personalities in LLMs, like those in humans, can influence and mitigate these biases.

Method: LLMs were tested with different Big Five personality profiles on TREC 2021 and 2022 datasets to evaluate their impact on priming susceptibility in relevance judgment tasks.

Result: The study found that LLMs with certain personality traits—like High Openness and Low Neuroticism—were less susceptible to priming, with effectiveness varying across LLM models and tasks.

Conclusion: The research suggests that 'personality prompting' could be an effective approach to reduce bias in LLM relevance labeling, providing a novel link between psychological theories and LLM evaluation practices.

Abstract: Recent research has explored LLMs as scalable tools for relevance labeling, but studies indicate they are susceptible to priming effects, where prior relevance judgments influence later ones. Although psychological theories link personality traits to such biases, it is unclear whether simulated personalities in LLMs exhibit similar effects. We investigate how Big Five personality profiles in LLMs influence priming in relevance labeling, using multiple LLMs on TREC 2021 and 2022 Deep Learning Track datasets. Our results show that certain profiles, such as High Openness and Low Neuroticism, consistently reduce priming susceptibility. Additionally, the most effective personality in mitigating priming may vary across models and task types. Based on these findings, we propose personality prompting as a method to mitigate threshold priming, connecting psychological evidence with LLM-based evaluation practices.

### [114] [A Taxonomy of Errors in English as she is spoke: Toward an AI-Based Method of Error Analysis for EFL Writing Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00392)
*Damian Heywood,Joseph Andrew Carrier,Kyu-Hong Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops an AI-assisted system for English writing error analysis, using linguistic theories, and tests its effectiveness on authentic error-rich texts. It identifies errors successfully but highlights areas for improvement in contextual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to transform English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instruction by automating detailed error correction and feedback using AI systems, enhancing learning outcomes.

Method: The system applies large language models (LLMs), grounded in linguistic taxonomy, to identify and categorize errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation via Python-based API calls. Testing includes error refinement and evaluation with authentic error-rich texts.

Result: The system accurately identifies diverse error types, though it struggles with contextual understanding and creates new error categories when faced with uncoded errors.

Conclusion: AI-powered error analysis holds promise for EFL instruction improvement, but requires advancements in contextual accuracy and taxonomy expansion to handle stylistic and discourse-level errors effectively.

Abstract: This study describes the development of an AI-assisted error analysis system designed to identify, categorize, and correct writing errors in English. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1, the system employs a detailed taxonomy grounded in linguistic theories from Corder (1967), Richards (1971), and James (1998). Errors are classified at both word and sentence levels, covering spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Implemented through Python-coded API calls, the system provides granular feedback beyond traditional rubric-based assessments. Initial testing on isolated errors refined the taxonomy, addressing challenges like overlapping categories. Final testing used "English as she is spoke" by Jose da Fonseca (1855), a text rich with authentic linguistic errors, to evaluate the system's capacity for handling complex, multi-layered analysis. The AI successfully identified diverse error types but showed limitations in contextual understanding and occasionally generated new error categories when encountering uncoded errors. This research demonstrates AI's potential to transform EFL instruction by automating detailed error analysis and feedback. While promising, further development is needed to improve contextual accuracy and expand the taxonomy to stylistic and discourse-level errors.

TL;DR: CryptoBench is an expert-curated, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Model agents in cryptocurrency analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for rigorous evaluation of LLM agents in the challenging cryptocurrency domain, which demands time-sensitive, adversarial, and multi-source data analysis capabilities.

Method: CryptoBench employs a live benchmark with 50 monthly expert-designed questions divided into categories: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction.

Result: Evaluation of ten LLMs reveals a performance hierarchy and a common failure mode: a retrieval-prediction imbalance in predictive tasks.

Conclusion: While LLMs excel at data retrieval, their predictive analysis abilities remain limited, indicating the need for improved synthesis and forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces CryptoBench, the first expert-curated, dynamic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the real-world capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in the uniquely demanding and fast-paced cryptocurrency domain. Unlike general-purpose agent benchmarks for search and prediction, professional crypto analysis presents specific challenges: \emph{extreme time-sensitivity}, \emph{a highly adversarial information environment}, and the critical need to synthesize data from \emph{diverse, specialized sources}, such as on-chain intelligence platforms and real-time Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dashboards. CryptoBench thus serves as a much more challenging and valuable scenario for LLM agent assessment. To address these challenges, we constructed a live, dynamic benchmark featuring 50 questions per month, expertly designed by crypto-native professionals to mirror actual analyst workflows. These tasks are rigorously categorized within a four-quadrant system: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction. This granular categorization enables a precise assessment of an LLM agent's foundational data-gathering capabilities alongside its advanced analytical and forecasting skills.
  Our evaluation of ten LLMs, both directly and within an agentic framework, reveals a performance hierarchy and uncovers a failure mode. We observe a \textit{retrieval-prediction imbalance}, where many leading models, despite being proficient at data retrieval, demonstrate a pronounced weakness in tasks requiring predictive analysis. This highlights a problematic tendency for agents to appear factually grounded while lacking the deeper analytical capabilities to synthesize information.

### [116] [SCALE: Selective Resource Allocation for Overcoming Performance Bottlenecks in Mathematical Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00466)
*Yang Xiao,Chunpu Xu,Ruifeng Yuan,Jiashuo Wang,Wenjie Li,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCALE, a framework for more efficient computational resource allocation in LLMs, leading to improved mathematical reasoning performance and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for enhancing large language models (LLMs) via test-time compute scaling distribute computational resources uniformly, leading to inefficiencies where challenging sub-problems are under-resourced, while simple tasks consume excessive computation.

Method: SCALE selectively allocates resources by decomposing problems, assessing sub-problem difficulty, assigning different processing modes (System 1 for simple tasks and System 2 for complex ones), and propagating context sequentially.

Result: SCALE improves accuracy by up to 13.75 percentage points (e.g., 57.50% to 71.25% on AIME25) while reducing computational costs by 33%-53%.

Conclusion: SCALE effectively enhances test-time compute scaling by addressing key inefficiencies in resource allocation, achieving better performance and more efficient resource usage compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, current methods employ uniform resource distribution across all reasoning sub-problems, creating fundamental bottlenecks where challenging sub-problems receive insufficient attention while routine operations consume disproportionate resources. This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation. By concentrating resources on challenging sub-problems while processing routine operations efficiently, SCALE achieves substantial performance improvements with superior resource utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALE significantly outperforms uniform scaling baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 13.75 percentage points (57.50% to 71.25% on AIME25) while reducing computational costs by 33%-53%, representing a major advance in test-time scaling that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.

*Diego A. B. Moreira,Alef I. Ferreira,Jhessica Silva,Gabriel O. dos Santos,Gustavo Bonil,João Gondim,Marina dos Santos,Helena Maia,Simone Hashiguti,Nádia da Silva,Carolina Scarton,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CACARA, an efficient architecture enabling multimodal and multilingual capabilities without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address resource-intensive training and retraining challenges for multimodal and multilingual models, and to efficiently integrate new modalities and languages.

Method: The proposed CACARA architecture uses emergent alignment learning, integrating new modalities while preserving prior knowledge with minimal retraining. Multilingual capabilities are achieved by aligning new modalities with English-only data.

Result: The model achieves up to 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Conclusion: CACARA provides an efficient method for building multimodal and multilingual models, bypassing resource-heavy training while retaining competitive or superior performance.

Abstract: As deep learning models evolve, new applications and challenges are rapidly emerging. Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language.

*Mengqi Liao,Lu Wang,Chaoyun Zhang,Zekai Shen,Xiaowei Mao,Si Qin,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang,Huaiyu Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces G-KV, a more efficient KV cache eviction method for reasoning large language models (LLMs), complemented by post-training optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning LLMs face computational and memory issues due to long sequence lengths and existing KV cache compression methods fail to address long-term token importance effectively.

Method: The paper presents G-KV, which uses a global scoring mechanism for token eviction by combining local and historical attention scores. It also applies reinforcement learning and distillation for post-training optimization.

Result: G-KV improves efficiency in reasoning tasks by accurately managing token importance and optimizing the model for compressed KV cache.

Conclusion: The proposed G-KV approach addresses the inefficiencies in existing compression methods and provides a robust solution to enhance the performance of reasoning LLMs under constrained computational conditions.

Abstract: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks but encounter significant computational and memory challenges due to long sequence lengths. KV cache compression has emerged as an effective approach to greatly enhance the efficiency of reasoning. However, existing methods often focus on prompt compression or token eviction with local attention score, overlooking the long-term importance of tokens. We propose G-KV, a KV cache eviction method that employs a global scoring mechanism, combining local and historical attention scores to more accurately assess token importance. Additionally, we introduce post-training techniques, including reinforcement learning and distillation, to optimize models for compressed KV cache settings.

TL;DR: The thesis introduces a comprehensive framework for sentiment analysis, focusing on Turkish and English, with multiple innovative contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in sentiment analysis, particularly for Turkish, and to explore advancements in sentiment analysis techniques for English.

Method: Combines unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised metrics, utilizes a mix of classical ML and novel neural network models, creates a polarity lexicon, develops new word embeddings, and refines linguistic modeling techniques.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance and significant accuracy improvements in sentiment analysis tasks for Turkish and English.

Conclusion: This thesis is a pioneering and comprehensive contribution to sentiment analysis in Turkish and has made advancements in English sentiment analysis methods as well.

Abstract: In this thesis, we developed a comprehensive framework for sentiment analysis that takes its many aspects into account mainly for Turkish. We have also proposed several approaches specific to sentiment analysis in English only. We have accordingly made five major and three minor contributions. We generated a novel and effective feature set by combining unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised metrics. We then fed them as input into classical machine learning methods, and outperformed neural network models for datasets of different genres in both Turkish and English. We created a polarity lexicon with a semi-supervised domain-specific method, which has been the first approach applied for corpora in Turkish. We performed a fine morphological analysis for the sentiment classification task in Turkish by determining the polarities of morphemes. This can be adapted to other morphologically-rich or agglutinative languages as well. We have built a novel neural network architecture, which combines recurrent and recursive neural network models for English. We built novel word embeddings that exploit sentiment, syntactic, semantic, and lexical characteristics for both Turkish and English. We also redefined context windows as subclauses in modelling word representations in English. This can also be applied to other linguistic fields and natural language processing tasks. We have achieved state-of-the-art and significant results for all these original approaches. Our minor contributions include methods related to aspect-based sentiment in Turkish, parameter redefinition in the semi-supervised approach, and aspect term extraction techniques for English. This thesis can be considered the most detailed and comprehensive study made on sentiment analysis in Turkish as of July, 2020. Our work has also contributed to the opinion classification problem in English.

TL;DR: The paper presents a diagnostic framework evaluating mathematical reasoning in language models beyond answer accuracy, demonstrating key reasoning failures in Qwen3-0.6B via case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the over-reliance on answer accuracy in evaluating mathematical reasoning, which masks failures in logical computation.

Method: Introduce a diagnostic framework with four axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness.

Result: Evaluated Qwen3-0.6B, revealing poor reasoning fidelity despite reasonable answer accuracy. Released model-agnostic evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: Surface-level answer accuracy can be misleading; the framework promotes better assessment of logical reasoning capabilities in language models.

Abstract: Current evaluation of mathematical reasoning in language models relies primarily on answer accuracy, potentially masking fundamental failures in logical computation. We introduce a diagnostic framework that distinguishes genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching through four complementary axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Through a case study applying this framework to Qwen3-0.6B on the MenatQA dataset, we reveal a striking disconnect between surface performance and reasoning fidelity. While the model achieves reasonable answer accuracy (70%+), it demonstrates poor backward consistency (15%), limited transitivity coverage (32.2%), and brittle sensitivity to perturbations. Our diagnostics expose reasoning failures invisible to traditional accuracy metrics, suggesting that this small model relies heavily on pattern matching rather than genuine logical computation. While our empirical findings are based on a single 600M-parameter model, the diagnostic framework itself is model-agnostic and generalizable. We release our evaluation protocols to enable the research community to assess reasoning fidelity across different model scales and architectures, moving beyond surface-level accuracy toward verifiable mathematical reasoning.

*Miroslav Blšták*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first conceptual dictionary for the Slovak language to address low resource availability in natural language processing for Slovak.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of dictionary tools and linguistic resources, especially for low-resourced languages like Slovak, limits the effectiveness of NLP tasks and automated text processing.

Method: The creation of a conceptual dictionary tailored for the Slovak language to fill the gap in machine-readable linguistic resources.

Result: The proposed conceptual dictionary is the first linguistic tool of its kind designed to support Slovak NLP tasks.

Conclusion: This initiative is expected to improve NLP processing capabilities for the Slovak language and provide foundational linguistic resources.

Abstract: When solving tasks in the field of natural language processing, we sometimes need dictionary tools, such as lexicons, word form dictionaries or knowledge bases. However, the availability of dictionary data is insufficient in many languages, especially in the case of low resourced languages. In this article, we introduce a new conceptual dictionary for the Slovak language as the first linguistic tool of this kind. Since Slovak language is a language with limited linguistic resources and there are currently not available any machine-readable linguistic data sources with a sufficiently large volume of data, many tasks which require automated processing of Slovak text achieve weaker results compared to other languages and are almost impossible to solve.

*Alla Chepurova,Aydar Bulatov,Yuri Kuratov,Mikhail Burtsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Wikontic, a pipeline for constructing high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from open-domain text, improving their compactness, consistency, and connectivity, while achieving competitive or superior performance in various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address how knowledge graphs (KGs) are underutilized in LLMs, often serving only as auxiliary tools for text retrieval, rather than enriching the intrinsic quality of knowledge representation.

Method: The proposed approach, Wikontic, uses a multi-stage pipeline to construct KGs: extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, applying Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. It demonstrates scalability and quality enhancement in generating compact and consistent KGs.

Result: Wikontic achieves high performance, such as 96% correct triplets on MuSiQue, and strong F1 scores on HotpotQA (76.0) and MuSiQue (59.8), surpassing some retrieval-augmented approaches without textual context. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the MINE-1 benchmark (86%) and is significantly more efficient than prior KG construction models like AriGraph and GraphRAG.

Conclusion: Wikontic presents a scalable, efficient framework for improving knowledge graph quality and demonstrates the potential for better leveraging structure-based knowledge in large language models.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $<$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.

*Franck Binard,Vanja Kljajevic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prism is a metalanguage for specifying agent behavior through compositional, reusable core grammars and domain-specific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a minimal, compact language for defining and controlling agent behavior in a way that is compositional, reusable, inspectable, and adaptable across domains.

Method: Prism uses a fixed core grammar, Core1, and a compositional design with abstract combinators. It allows domain-specific extensions for predicates, tools, and categories.

Result: Worked examples demonstrate Prism's applications across thermostat control, home security, e-commerce, and medical monitoring, showcasing how decision rules can be executed as inspectable and analyzable policies.

Conclusion: Prism offers a clear separation of reusable language elements from domain-specific extensions, creating an interface that is intuitive, effective, and safe for agent policy control and analysis.

Abstract: Prism is a small, compositional metalanguage for specifying the behaviour of tool-using software agents. Rather than introducing ad hoc control constructs, Prism is built around a fixed core context, Core1, which provides a minimal background grammar of categories numbers, strings, user prompts, tools together with abstract combinators for booleans, predicates, pairs, and lists. Agent policies are written as ordinary expressions using a single abstraction operator so that conditionals appear as selections between alternatives instead of imperative if-else blocks. Domains extend the core by defining their own context-mini-grammars that introduce new categories, predicates, and external tools while reusing the same compositional machinery. We illustrate this with worked examples from thermostat control, home security, e-commerce recommendation, and medical monitoring, showing how natural language decision rules can be mapped to inspectable, executable policies. From a linguistic perspective, Prism enforces a clear separation between a reusable grammar-like core and domain specific lexicons and treats tools as bridges between internal policy representations and the external world. From an engineering perspective, it offers a compact interface language for agent control, making the space of possible actions explicit and amenable to analysis, verification, and safety constraints.

Conclusion: ART is a scalable and effective framework for applications demanding high-quality and vetted LLM responses, offering consistent and reliable output quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches. The ART framework provides a scalable, production-ready solution for applications requiring high-quality, vetted LLM responses, achieving an 8.4% improvement in overall quality metrics and R22 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using visual knowledge graphs to identify and mitigate hallucinations in large language models by linking assertions to sources and enabling human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address hallucinations in large language models, particularly in enterprise contexts, where they often stem from operational issues like limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and added domain-specific knowledge.

Method: The method involves constructing visual knowledge graphs that link model assertions to their sources of truth, indicating confidence levels to detect potential hallucinations. It also incorporates a human-in-the-loop workflow for diagnosing issues and providing corrective feedback.

Result: The framework allows end-users to identify inconsistencies, address weak reasoning chains, and ensure better alignment of the model's outputs with verified information.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the reliability and quality of responses from large language models by providing transparency and a structured feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.

Method: A comparison of GPT-4 performance to human annotators was conducted using multiple GPT versions (3.5, 4, and 4o) and four prompt styles. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 scores were evaluated quantitatively, alongside qualitative analysis.

Result: Including label definitions in prompts can help boost GPT-4's performance, but overall it struggles with nuanced language classification. Four insights were drawn qualitatively from the results.

Conclusion: Careful consideration is required when deploying GPT-based AI like ChatGPT for classification tasks involving subtle language nuances, as its performance may not consistently match human-level understanding.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence tools, like ChatGPT, are an increasingly utilized resource among computational social scientists. Nevertheless, there remains space for improved understanding of the performance of ChatGPT in complex tasks such as classifying and annotating datasets containing nuanced language. Method. In this paper, we measure the performance of GPT-4 on one such task and compare results to human annotators. We investigate ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4o to examine performance given rapid changes in technological advancement of large language models. We craft four prompt styles as input and evaluate precision, recall, and F1 scores. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of results demonstrate that while including label definitions in prompts may help performance, overall GPT-4 has difficulty classifying nuanced language. Qualitative analysis reveals four specific findings. Our results suggest the use of ChatGPT in classification tasks involving nuanced language should be conducted with prudence.

Motivation: Improve POS tagging for low-resource languages and enable easy cross-lingual adaptation in NLP systems.

Method: Utilized a language-agnostic transformer-based approach that required minimal code modification to adapt from Bangla to Hindi.

Result: Achieved 96.85% and 97% accuracy for Bangla and Hindi, respectively, with robust F1 scores despite dataset challenges.

Conclusion: The modular, open-source framework allows efficient adaptation to new languages, supporting future work in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This study proposes a language-agnostic transformer-based POS tagging framework designed for low-resource languages, using Bangla and Hindi as case studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited access to high-end computational resources in Bangla NLP development and to enhance efficiency in training without compromising performance.

Method: The authors utilized automatic mixed precision (AMP) training, blending 16-bit and 32-bit computations, to optimize GPU memory usage and accelerate training. They tested AMP on four Bangla NLP tasks using models like BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT.

Result: AMP achieved a 44.5% reduction in training time, a 17.6% reduction in memory consumption, and maintained model performance within 99.7% of full-precision baselines.

Conclusion: AMP training can significantly democratize NLP advancements in systems with limited computing resources by lowering resource demands while preserving performance.

Abstract: Training models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) requires substantial computational resources and time, posing significant challenges, especially for NLP development in Bangla, where access to high-end hardware is often limited. In this work, we explore automatic mixed precision (AMP) training as a means to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing model performance. By leveraging a dynamic mix of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point computations, AMP lowers GPU memory requirements and speeds up training without degrading model performance. We evaluate AMP across four standard Bangla NLP tasks, namely sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, error classification, and question answering, using four transformer-based models: BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT. Our results demonstrate that AMP accelerates training by 44.5% and reduces memory consumption by 17.6%, while maintaining F-1 score within 99.7% of the full-precision baselines. This empirical study highlights AMP's potential to democratize access to state-of-the-art NLP capabilities in hardware-constrained settings by lowering computational barriers.

*Yukang Lin,Jiahao Shao,Shuoran Jiang,Wentao Zhu,Bingjie Lu,Xiangping Wu,Joanna Siebert,Qingcai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WaterSearch introduces a novel watermarking framework for Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring high-quality text and robust detectability under attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off in existing watermarking methods between detectability and text quality in LLM-generated content, while enhancing robustness against attacks.

Method: Proposed a sentence-level, search-based watermarking system called WaterSearch that uses a novel embedding scheme controlling seed pools, optimizing fidelity and watermark signal strength.

Result: Achieved a 51.01% improvement over baselines at 95% detectability; robust performance in scenarios like short texts (47.78% gain) and low-entropy outputs (36.47% gain), and strong robustness under various attacks.

Conclusion: WaterSearch significantly advances watermarking technology by enhancing LLM text quality and maintaining robust watermark detectability across diverse tasks and attack scenarios.

Abstract: Watermarking acts as a critical safeguard in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By embedding identifiable signals into model outputs, watermarking enables reliable attribution and enhances the security of machine-generated content. Existing approaches typically embed signals by manipulating token generation probabilities. Despite their effectiveness, these methods inherently face a trade-off between detectability and text quality: the signal strength and randomness required for robust watermarking tend to degrade the performance of downstream tasks.
  In this paper, we design a novel embedding scheme that controls seed pools to facilitate diverse parallel generation of watermarked text. Based on that scheme, we propose WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework adaptable to a wide range of existing methods. WaterSearch enhances text quality by jointly optimizing two key aspects: 1) distribution fidelity and 2) watermark signal characteristics. Furthermore, WaterSearch is complemented by a sentence-level detection method with strong attack robustness. We evaluate our method on three popular LLMs across ten diverse tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average performance improvement of 51.01\% over state-of-the-art baselines at a watermark detectability strength of 95\%. In challenging scenarios such as short text generation and low-entropy output generation, our method yields performance gains of 47.78\% and 36.47\%, respectively. Moreover, under different attack senarios including insertion, synonym substitution and paraphrase attasks, WaterSearch maintains high detectability, further validating its robust anti-attack capabilities.

*Chunlin Tian,Xuyang Wei,Huanrong Liu,Zhijiang Guo,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EffiLoRA enhances the LoRA method, offering a lightweight parameter-efficient approach to improve performance in language, multimodal, and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA struggles with overhead and parameter interference when fine-tuning complex datasets, prompting the need for a more efficient approach.

Method: EffiLoRA replaces the separate matrices in LoRA with a unified A matrix and introduces runtime selective B matrix updates to optimize resource allocation and trade-offs.

Result: The proposed EffiLoRA method demonstrates consistent outperformance over LoRA across various tasks including reasoning, visual instruction, and image generation.

Conclusion: EffiLoRA enhances efficiency and robustness, making it a more practical fine-tuning option across diverse applications.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in complex datasets. While re- cent works decouple LoRA update matrices to exploit matrix-wise asymmetry, training costs remain high. We revisit LoRA from the perspective of inter-matrix and intra-layer parameter redundancy and propose Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation, EffiLoRA, a lightweight and generalizable approach for language, multimodal, and diffusion models. EffiLoRA employs a unified A matrix across all transformer layers and introduces a runtime selective B matrices up- date to dynamically trade-off the system resource budget and model performance. EffiLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA across diverse modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, demon- strating improved efficiency and robustness.

### [133] [Reward Auditor: Inference on Reward Modeling Suitability in Real-World Perturbed Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00920)
*Jianxiang Zang,Yongda Wei,Ruxue Bai,Shiyu Jiang,Nijia Mo,Binhong Li,Qiang Sun,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reward Auditor, a framework for evaluating reward models' suitability by identifying systematic vulnerabilities under real-world perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for reward models focus only on preference perception accuracy without addressing their reliability in real-world complex scenarios, leaving vulnerabilities unexamined.

Method: The authors propose the Reward Auditor, a hypothesis-testing framework that audits and quantifies distribution degradations in reward model preference perception under real-world perturbations.

Result: Reward Auditor allows inference of the certainty and severity of reward model vulnerabilities in various real-world conditions by analyzing statistical significance and effect size.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a foundation for designing next-generation large language model alignment systems that are verifiably safe, robust, and trustworthy with application of the Reward Auditor.

Abstract: Reliable reward models (RMs) are critical for ensuring the safe alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, current evaluation methods focus solely on preference perception accuracies in given specific scenarios, obscuring the critical vulnerabilities of RMs in real-world scenarios. We identify the true challenge lies in assessing a novel dimension: Suitability, defined as conditional reliability under specific real-world perturbations. To this end, we introduce Reward Auditor, a hypothesis-testing framework specifically designed for RM suitability inference. Rather than answering "How accurate is the RM's preference perception for given samples?", it employs scientific auditing to answer: "Can we infer RMs exhibit systematic vulnerabilities in specific real-world scenarios?". Under real-world perturbed scenarios, Reward Auditor quantifies statistical significance and effect size by auditing distribution degradation of RM preference perception confidence. This enables inference of both the certainty and severity of RM vulnerabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. This lays a solid foundation for building next-generation LLM alignment systems that are verifiably safe, more robust, and trustworthy.

*Imane Jaaouine,Ross D. King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how prompt engineering (PE) can reduce context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot summarization of scientific texts using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to address hallucinations, specifically context inconsistencies, in LLM-generated outputs for scientific summarization tasks.

Method: The experiment involved six instruction-tuned LLMs, eight research paper abstracts, and seven prompt methods, including baseline, instruction complexity, context repetition (CR), and random addition (RA). The 336 generated summaries were evaluated using six alignment metrics, and statistical analysis was conducted to test hypotheses related to prompt methods.

Result: Context repetition (CR) and random addition (RA) methods were found to significantly enhance the lexical alignment of outputs with source abstracts, indicating a reduction in hallucinations.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations in LLM tasks, specifically in scientific summarization under zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce context inconsistency hallucinations, which are LLM generated outputs that are misaligned with the user prompt. This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts. These findings indicate that prompt engineering has the potential to impact hallucinations in zero-shot scientific summarisation tasks.

### [135] [DeformAr: Rethinking NER Evaluation through Component Analysis and Visual Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00938)
*Ahmed Mustafa Younes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeformAr, a framework for analyzing the performance gap in NER systems between Arabic and English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and explain the performance discrepancy in NER systems for Arabic compared to English due to tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies.

Method: DeformAr includes a data extraction library and interactive dashboard, using cross-component and behavioural analyses to diagnose and explain discrepancies.

Result: The framework enables systematic diagnostics and interpretability techniques, providing visualisations and linking Arabic NER system performance to data and model interactions.

Conclusion: DeformAr is the first tool centered on Arabic, helping advance model analysis in under-resourced languages and bridging performance gaps.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance in English. However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.
  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.
  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the "what," "how," and "why" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages.

*Alvaro Paredes Amorin,Andre Python,Christoph Weisser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) for financial sentiment analysis and concludes they can perform well with limited resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs, restricted access, and computational demands associated with proprietary LLMs in financial markets analysis.

Method: The study compared lightweight open-source LLMs (DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, Qwen3 8B) and FinBERT using five publicly available financial datasets. It analyzed performance under zero-shot and few-shot settings using varying subsets of training data.

Result: Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B outperformed other models, achieving strong performance across different datasets, even when trained with just 5% of the available data.

Conclusion: Lightweight, open-source LLMs are viable, cost-efficient alternatives for financial sentiment analysis, capable of generalizing well across heterogeneous data while minimizing resource constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) play an increasingly important role in finan- cial markets analysis by capturing signals from complex and heterogeneous textual data sources, such as tweets, news articles, reports, and microblogs. However, their performance is dependent on large computational resources and proprietary datasets, which are costly, restricted, and therefore inacces- sible to many researchers and practitioners. To reflect realistic situations we investigate the ability of lightweight open-source LLMs - smaller and publicly available models designed to operate with limited computational resources - to generalize sentiment understanding from financial datasets of varying sizes, sources, formats, and languages. We compare the benchmark finance natural language processing (NLP) model, FinBERT, and three open-source lightweight LLMs, DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B on five publicly available datasets: FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment and Chinese Finance Sentiment. We find that LLMs, specially Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B, perform best in most scenarios, even from using only 5% of the available training data. These results hold in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our findings indicate that lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) consti- tute a cost-effective option, as they can achieve competitive performance on heterogeneous textual data even when trained on only a limited subset of the extensive annotated corpora that are typically deemed necessary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TAMO, a multimodal framework that integrates tabular data with Large Language Models (LLMs) to address limitations in table reasoning tasks, showing significant improvements in benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for using LLMs with tabular data rely solely on serializing the tables into text, which overlooks their structural information, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose TAMO, a multimodal framework that combines a hypergraph neural network for table encoding with mainstream LLMs, preserving the structural modality of tables.

Result: Empirical evaluations on datasets like HiTab, WikiTQ, WikiSQL, FeTaQA, and StructQA show a considerable improvement in generalization, achieving an average relative gain of 42.65%.

Conclusion: By treating tables as an independent modality and integrating structural information, TAMO successfully enhances table reasoning capabilities in LLMs, addressing existing limitations.

Abstract: To migrate the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), the community has made numerous efforts to generalize them to the table reasoning tasks for the widely deployed tabular data. Despite that, in this work, by showing a probing experiment on our proposed StructQA benchmark, we postulate that even the most advanced LLMs (such as GPTs) may still fall short of coping with tabular data. More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM. Empirical results on various benchmarking datasets, including HiTab, WikiTQ, WikiSQL, FeTaQA, and StructQA, have demonstrated significant improvements on generalization with an average relative gain of 42.65%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dr.Mi-Bench, a modular benchmark for evaluating scientific deep research (DR) agents, alongside a novel evaluation paradigm, Dr.Mi-Eval. Results highlight performance challenges and the need for improved high-level planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The explosive increase in academic literature necessitates automated DR agents for research purposes, but their proper evaluation across scientific domains is lacking in current benchmarks.

Method: A benchmark called Dr.Mi-Bench, grounded in human-annotated datasets across 10 scientific domains, is introduced. Additionally, the Dr.Mi-Eval paradigm assesses DR agents via end-to-end and isolated evaluation modes.

Result: Experiments show fragmented performance across DR agents, with specialized strengths but critical weaknesses in multi-source retrieval and consistent performance across domains. High-level planning is identified as a key area for improvement.

Conclusion: Dr.Mi-Bench serves as a diagnostic benchmark tool to identify weaknesses and guide the development of more effective academic research assistants.

Abstract: The explosive growth in academic literature necessitates automated deep research (DR) agents, yet their evaluation remains a significant challenge. First, existing benchmarks often focus narrowly on retrieval while neglecting high-level planning and reasoning. Second, existing benchmarks favor general domains over the scientific domains that are the core application for DR agents. To address these gaps, we introduce Dr.Mi-Bench, a Modular-integrated benchmark for scientific DR agents. Grounded in academic literature, our benchmark uses a human-annotated dataset of 200 instances across 10 scientific domains, including both research and review papers. Besides, we also propose a Modular-integrated Evaluation Paradigm for DR Agents (Dr.Mi-Eval), a novel modular-integrated evaluation paradigm, which leverages the rich structure of academic papers to assess the core competencies of planning, retrieval, and reasoning through two complementary modes: an end-to-end evaluation for DR agents and an isolated evaluation for foundational LLMs as potential backbones. Experimental results reveal a fragmented performance landscape: agents exhibit specialized strengths but share critical weaknesses, most notably in performing the multi-source retrieval required for review-style tasks and performing consistently across diverse scientific fields. Moreover, improving high-level planning capability is the crucial factor for unlocking the reasoning potential of foundational LLMs as backbones. By exposing these actionable failure modes, Dr.Mi-Bench provides a diagnostic tool to guide the development of more reliable academic research assistants.

*Nicole Favero,Francesca Salute,Daniel Hardt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of LLMs in QA using Graph RAG and Advanced RAG, and their capability to create academic outputs like slides and podcast scripts. GPT 4o mini with Advanced RAG performed best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the evaluation of LLMs beyond traditional tasks to include retrieval strategies and non-traditional academic output generation.

Method: A prototype combining Meta's LLaMA 3 70B and OpenAI's GPT 4o mini API was implemented. QA was assessed through human and LLM judges, and slide/podcast generation used document-grounded retrieval.

Result: GPT 4o mini with Advanced RAG resulted in the most accurate QA responses. Graph RAG increased hallucinations. GPT 4o mini excelled in slide and podcast generation, while LLaMA 3 demonstrated narrative coherence.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effective for both QA tasks and academic content creation, but human-LMM evaluation is essential to ensure quality, especially for stylistic and layout aspects.

Abstract: Most evaluations of large language models focus on standard tasks such as factual question answering or short summarization. This research expands that scope in two directions: first, by comparing two retrieval strategies, Graph RAG, structured knowledge-graph based, and Advanced RAG, hybrid keyword-semantic search, for QA; and second, by evaluating whether LLMs can generate high quality non-traditional academic outputs, specifically slide decks and podcast scripts. We implemented a prototype combining Meta's LLaMA 3 70B open weight and OpenAI's GPT 4o mini API based. QA performance was evaluated using both human ratings across eleven quality dimensions and large language model judges for scalable cross validation. GPT 4o mini with Advanced RAG produced the most accurate responses. Graph RAG offered limited improvements and led to more hallucinations, partly due to its structural complexity and manual setup. Slide and podcast generation was tested with document grounded retrieval. GPT 4o mini again performed best, though LLaMA 3 showed promise in narrative coherence. Human reviewers were crucial for detecting layout and stylistic flaws, highlighting the need for combined human LLM evaluation in assessing emerging academic outputs.

### [140] [When Safety Blocks Sense: Measuring Semantic Confusion in LLM Refusals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01037)
*Riad Ahmed Anonto,Md Labid Al Nahiyan,Md Tanvir Hassan,Ch. Md. Rakin Haider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'semantic confusion,' a failure mode for safety-aligned language models leading to local inconsistencies, and provides tools for its evaluation using a new dataset and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of current evaluations to capture local inconsistencies in safety-aligned language models where different phrasings of the same intent yield contradictory outcomes.

Method: The authors develop ParaGuard, a dataset with paraphrase clusters, and propose token-level metrics: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth to measure local inconsistencies in model responses.

Result: The metrics reveal hidden inconsistencies in language model refusals, showing that global false rejection metrics overlook critical nuances and allowing developers to diagnose these issues effectively.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework to better evaluate and improve language models by diagnosing and reducing local inconsistencies without compromising safety standards.

Abstract: Safety-aligned language models often refuse prompts that are actually harmless. Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce "semantic confusion," a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ELR-1000 dataset, consisting of 1,060 traditional recipes in endangered languages from Eastern India, and evaluates how well large language models can translate the dataset while preserving cultural nuances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to document and preserve linguistic and cultural diversity inherent in endangered languages, particularly in food traditions, while addressing the challenges faced by language models in translating low-resource, culturally-rich languages.

Method: The authors crowdsource recipes from rural communities in 10 endangered languages using a mobile interface suitable for individuals with low digital literacy, compile the ELR-1000 dataset, and evaluate the translation capabilities of advanced large language models with added cultural context.

Result: State-of-the-art language models perform inadequately when translating recipes from endangered languages, but targeted contextual information significantly enhances their translation quality.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of creating benchmarks for low-resource languages and culturally-sensitive domains, releasing ELR-1000 to promote further advancements in equitable language technologies.

Abstract: We present a culturally-grounded multimodal dataset of 1,060 traditional recipes crowdsourced from rural communities across remote regions of Eastern India, spanning 10 endangered languages. These recipes, rich in linguistic and cultural nuance, were collected using a mobile interface designed for contributors with low digital literacy. Endangered Language Recipes (ELR)-1000 -- captures not only culinary practices but also the socio-cultural context embedded in indigenous food traditions. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on translating these recipes into English and find the following: despite the models' capabilities, they struggle with low-resource, culturally-specific language. However, we observe that providing targeted context -- including background information about the languages, translation examples, and guidelines for cultural preservation -- leads to significant improvements in translation quality. Our results underscore the need for benchmarks that cater to underrepresented languages and domains to advance equitable and culturally-aware language technologies. As part of this work, we release the ELR-1000 dataset to the NLP community, hoping it motivates the development of language technologies for endangered languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper surveys and analyzes privacy protection metrics in text anonymization, offering a framework for effective evaluation and legal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to reconcile and clarify approaches for evaluating text anonymization privacy, particularly given the sensitive nature of data in NLP and the challenges of assessing whether methods safeguard privacy sufficiently.

Method: The authors manually reviewed 47 papers to identify six privacy notions, analyzed related metrics and their alignment with legal standards (HIPAA, GDPR) and user expectations from HCI studies, providing a systematic survey.

Result: The paper categorizes six privacy notions, evaluates their coverage of privacy risks, and assesses alignment with legal and user-centered frameworks. It highlights current gaps and provides practical recommendations for improvements.

Conclusion: The work facilitates better understanding and use of privacy evaluation metrics in NLP, ensuring they are robust, comparable, and legally aware to improve privacy protection in text anonymization.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to clarify and reconcile metrics for evaluating privacy protection in text through a systematic survey. Although text anonymization is essential for enabling NLP research and model development in domains with sensitive data, evaluating whether anonymization methods sufficiently protect privacy remains an open challenge. In manually reviewing 47 papers that report privacy metrics, we identify and compare six distinct privacy notions, and analyze how the associated metrics capture different aspects of privacy risk. We then assess how well these notions align with legal privacy standards (HIPAA and GDPR), as well as user-centered expectations grounded in HCI studies. Our analysis offers practical guidance on navigating the landscape of privacy evaluation approaches further and highlights gaps in current practices. Ultimately, we aim to facilitate more robust, comparable, and legally aware privacy evaluations in text anonymization.

*Hyunjun Kim,Sooyoung Ryu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DrawingBench is a verification framework designed to evaluate the trustworthiness of agentic AI systems, focusing on spatial reasoning tasks and low-level GUI actions. It provides objective and transparent assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency and reproducibility in the evaluation of autonomous AI agents, particularly in scenarios where trust is critical.

Method: The authors developed DrawingBench, consisting of 250 prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and human oversight via multi-turn feedback. The framework involves transparent and rule-based assessments.

Result: Testing on four advanced LLMs across 1,000 evaluations, the models averaged 92.8% perfect performance. Structured external feedback improved results significantly, highlighting errors in tool state management and long-term planning.

Conclusion: Transparent evaluation frameworks, like DrawingBench, enhance trust in agentic AI systems and external feedback is superior to self-correction in guiding behavior. The framework is accessible via open-source resources.

Abstract: As agentic AI systems increasingly operate autonomously, establishing trust through verifiable evaluation becomes critical. Yet existing benchmarks lack the transparency and auditability needed to assess whether agents behave reliably. We present DrawingBench, a verification framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of agentic LLMs through spatial reasoning tasks that require generating sequences of low-level GUI actions. Unlike opaque evaluations, DrawingBench provides transparent, rule-based assessment: 8 objective criteria enable reproducible scoring, while action-level inspection allows stakeholders to audit agent behavior. Our framework comprises 250 diverse prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and an external oversight mechanism through multi-turn feedback that enables human control over agent refinement. Evaluating four state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5 Flash) across 1,000 tests, we establish both capabilities and limitations: models achieved 92.8% perfect performance with structured external feedback driving significant improvements (average +3.2%, up to +32.8% for complex scenes), but systematic error patterns emerged in tool state management and long-horizon planning. Notably, specification clarity proved more important than task complexity -- models achieved 100% perfect performance when given explicit, verifiable criteria. These findings demonstrate that transparent evaluation frameworks can establish trust in agentic systems, with external oversight proving more reliable than self-correction for guiding agent behavior. Our open-source framework provides a template for trustworthy agent assessment. Code and data: https://github.com/hyunjun1121/DrawingBench

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the interaction between text perturbations and temperature settings in RAG systems, highlighting vulnerabilities and patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of RAG systems often neglects the interplay between retrieval noise and generation settings, which is critical for optimizing robust models.

Method: The authors propose a Perturbation-Temperature Analysis Framework to explore the effects of text perturbations across different temperature levels, using experiments with HotpotQA and multiple LLMs.

Result: High temperatures amplify sensitivity to perturbations, while certain types of perturbations exhibit non-linear effects. The study provides three key contributions including a benchmark, framework, and practical guidelines.

Conclusion: Understanding the interaction between perturbations and temperature settings is crucial for robust RAG system design, and the provided insights are beneficial for parameter tuning and model optimization.

Abstract: The evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically examines retrieval quality and generation parameters like temperature in isolation, overlooking their interaction. This work presents a systematic investigation of how text perturbations (simulating noisy retrieval) interact with temperature settings across multiple LLM runs. We propose a comprehensive RAG Perturbation-Temperature Analysis Framework that subjects retrieved documents to three distinct perturbation types across varying temperature settings. Through extensive experiments on HotpotQA with both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we demonstrate that performance degradation follows distinct patterns: high-temperature settings consistently amplify vulnerability to perturbations, while certain perturbation types exhibit non-linear sensitivity across the temperature range. Our work yields three key contributions: (1) a diagnostic benchmark for assessing RAG robustness, (2) an analytical framework for quantifying perturbation-temperature interactions, and (3) practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning under noisy retrieval conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarked clinical AI assistants and general large language models (LLMs), finding that general LLMs outperform clinical tools in accuracy, safety, and overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the safety, reliability, and performance of clinical AI assistants as they are being increasingly integrated into medical practices, often without independent evaluations.

Method: A 1,000-item benchmark combining MedQA and HealthBench tasks was used to compare two clinical systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three general LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5).

Result: General LLMs outperformed specialized clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores. Clinical tools struggled in areas like communication quality, context awareness, and safety reasoning.

Conclusion: The findings highlight significant gaps in clinical AI assistants and stress the necessity for transparent and independent evaluations to ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Specialized clinical AI assistants are rapidly entering medical practice, often framed as safer or more reliable than general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Yet, unlike frontier models, these clinical tools are rarely subjected to independent, quantitative evaluation, creating a critical evidence gap despite their growing influence on diagnosis, triage, and guideline interpretation. We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks. Generalist models consistently outperformed clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores, while OpenEvidence and UpToDate demonstrated deficits in completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and systems-based safety reasoning. These findings reveal that tools marketed for clinical decision support may often lag behind frontier LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for transparent, independent evaluation before deployment in patient-facing workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study develops a translation framework using AI to better convey conceptual metaphors in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) texts, improving readability and application for readers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of literal translations of TCM texts, which fail to capture the conceptual metaphors essential for understanding and clinical application.

Method: A HITL framework was used to guide an AI model (DeepSeek V3.1) in identifying and conveying metaphors/metonymy in translations of Huangdi Neijing passages. AI and human translations were evaluated using simulated reader scores and interviews.

Result: Prompt-adjusted translations by the AI performed best across all cognitive dimensions, showing consistent improvement in metaphor/metonymy transfer and alignment with readers' cognitive preferences.

Conclusion: The HITL approach offers a replicable, efficient method for translating dense conceptual texts like TCM, enhancing readability and application through improved metaphorical representation.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient, and replicable HITL methodological pathway for the translation of ancient, concept-dense texts such as TCM.

Result: The approach enables detecting sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) and basic emotions in Nagamese textual data.

Conclusion: This work pioneers sentiment analysis and emotion classification for Nagamese language, offering foundational tools and insights for further research.

Abstract: The Nagamese language, a.k.a Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the people from Nagaland and people from Assam in the north-east India. Substantial amount of work in sentiment analysis has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt on sentiment analysis and emotion classification for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to detect sentiments in terms of polarity (positive, negative and neutral) and basic emotions contained in textual content of Nagamese language. We build sentiment polarity lexicon of 1,195 nagamese words and use these to build features along with additional features for supervised machine learning techniques using Na"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve current benchmarks for LLMs in chemistry, addressing task oversimplification, lack of reasoning evaluation, and misalignment with expert chemists' skills.

Method: A curated benchmark of complex chemistry problems, multimodal formats, expert-authored solutions, and reasoning path fidelity scoring.

Result: The best-performing LLM (GPT-5 High) achieves 38.5% accuracy, below the human baseline of 40.3%. Other models perform slightly lower.

Conclusion: SUPERChem highlights reasoning challenges for LLMs in expert-level chemistry, enabling further improvement toward high-fidelity problem solving.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating the chemical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by oversimplified tasks, lack of process-level evaluation, and misalignment with expert-level chemistry skills. To address these issues, we introduce SUPERChem, a benchmark of 500 expert-curated reasoning-intensive chemistry problems, covering diverse subfields and provided in both multimodal and text-only formats. Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence.

*Jiahao Yuan,Zhiqing Cui,Hanqing Wang,Yuansheng Gao,Yucheng Zhou,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KardiaBench is introduced as a large-scale benchmark for personalized, psychologically plausible empathetic reasoning, alongside a model framework (Kardia-R1) that demonstrates superior empathy-driven conversation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the lack of datasets integrating persistent user identity and the inadequacy of opaque reward signals in fostering authentic empathetic reasoning in conversational agents.

Method: The proposed KardiaBench dataset is created using a model-in-the-loop approach for refining conversations. Additionally, Kardia-R1 employs a novel reinforcement learning method (Rubric-ERL) relying on human-aligned rubric rewards for interpretable empathetic cognition.

Result: Experimental results across four large language models reveal that Kardia-R1 improves emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety in conversations.

Conclusion: The integration of user-grounded benchmarks and interpretable reinforcement learning enhances the personalization and emotional depth of conversational agents, marking a step forward in empathetic AI.

Abstract: As web platforms evolve towards greater personalization and emotional complexity, conversational agents must transcend superficial empathy to demonstrate identity-aware emotional reasoning. However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles. The dataset is constructed via a model-in-the-loop pipeline with iterative rubric-guided refinement to ensure psychological plausibility and persona consistency. This progressive empathy pipeline that integrates user comprehension, contextual reasoning, and emotion perception into conversations, followed by iterative critique and rubric-based refinement to ensure psychological plausibility, emotional fidelity, and persona consistency. Building on this, we propose Kardia-R1, a framework that trains models for interpretable, stepwise empathetic cognition. Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation. Extensive experiments across four LLM backbones demonstrate that Kardia-R1 consistently outperforms othet methods in emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety. Our dataset and model will be released at https://github.com/JhCircle/Kardia-R1.

### [150] [Agreement-Constrained Probabilistic Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01316)
*Koki Natsumi,Hiroyuki Deguchi,Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new decoding method, AC-PMBR, to enhance translation quality while reducing computational costs compared to existing probabilistic methods by leveraging knowledge from a distilled model for improved matrix completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MBR decoding offers high-quality translations but requires quadratic computational effort due to pairwise candidate scoring. Probabilistic MBR decoding reduces this cost but compromises quality, necessitating better quality-cost trade-offs.

Method: The proposed AC-PMBR employs a knowledge-distilled model to guide the matrix completion process in PMBR, improving the approximation accuracy of missing scores in translation candidate evaluations.

Result: AC-PMBR reduced matrix completion errors by up to 3 times and delivered better translation quality compared to PMBR decoding at a similar computational cost on WMT'23 En↔De tasks.

Conclusion: AC-PMBR represents an effective balance between translation quality and computational cost, outperforming previous probabilistic methods by leveraging additional knowledge from a distilled model.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding generates high-quality translations by maximizing the expected utility of output candidates, but it evaluates all pairwise scores over the candidate set; hence, it takes quadratic time with respect to the number of candidates. To reduce the number of utility function calls, probabilistic MBR (PMBR) decoding partially evaluates quality scores using sampled pairs of candidates and completes the missing scores with a matrix completion algorithm. Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced. Therefore, to improve the trade-off between quality and cost, we propose agreement-constrained PMBR (AC-PMBR) decoding, which leverages a knowledge distilled model to guide the completion of the score matrix. Our AC-PMBR decoding improved approximation errors of matrix completion by up to 3 times and achieved higher translation quality compared with PMBR decoding at a comparable computational cost on the WMT'23 En$\leftrightarrow$De translation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduction of a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM) designed for sentiment analysis, showcasing improved performance on both coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment tasks through multimodal hierarchical feature fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in understanding and analyzing hierarchical semantic representations and nuanced emotional expressions in sentiment classification tasks.

Method: DyFuLM employs two main modules: the Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module, which integrates multi-level features adaptively, and the Gated Feature Aggregation module, which manages cross-layer information flow. It also utilizes a dynamic loss mechanism for task balance.

Result: DyFuLM achieves high accuracy rates (82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained), low regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082), and significant R^2 improvement (R^2 = 0.6903). Ablation studies indicate that removing individual modules significantly impacts accuracy.

Conclusion: DyFuLM significantly improves sentiment representation and task balance via effective hierarchical feature fusion, validated by enhanced model performance and comprehensive experimental results.

Abstract: Understanding sentiment in complex textual expressions remains a fundamental challenge in affective computing. To address this, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM), a multimodal framework designed to capture both hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained emotional nuances. DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks. Keeping only the gated fusion module causes decreases of 0.75% and 0.55%, while removing the dynamic loss mechanism results in drops of 0.78% and 0.26% for coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification, respectively. These results demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to feature interaction and task balance. Overall, the experimental findings further validate that DyFuLM enhances sentiment representation and overall performance through effective hierarchical feature fusion.

### [153] [PromptBridge: Cross-Model Prompt Transfer for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01420)
*Yaxuan Wang,Quan Liu,Zhenting Wang,Zichao Li,Wei Wei,Yang Liu,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with 'Model Drifting,' where prompts fail to work effectively across models. PromptBridge, a training-free framework, resolves this by enabling optimized cross-model prompt transfer with minimal effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of 'Model Drifting,' where prompts for one LLM often perform poorly when used with another due to the variability in capabilities and architectures of LLMs. This challenge is exacerbated by the frequent need to switch models in dynamic use cases.

Method: The proposed solution, PromptBridge, uses Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to iteratively generate optimal prompts specifically tuned to the source and target models. It then establishes a cross-model prompt mapping, enabling effective prompt translation between models without task-specific re-optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PromptBridge significantly improves task accuracy across different LLM configurations and streamlines the process of adapting prompts between models in single-agent and multi-agent contexts.

Conclusion: PromptBridge effectively mitigates the challenges posed by model drifting, providing a practical solution for cross-model prompt adaptation. This method enhances performance across various LLMs while minimizing the time and cost of re-optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin applications in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and agent-based workflows. In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.

TL;DR: The paper explores improving low-resource language models through Active Learning, clustering, and data selection schedulers during fine-tuning, yielding better performance with less annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages suffer from limited data, making it challenging to achieve strong language models. Improving these models during the fine-tuning phase is a practical and cost-effective approach.

Method: The authors propose an integrated pipeline combining Active Learning (AL), data clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to optimize the fine-tuning process of language models.

Result: Experiments on Slovak, Maltese, Icelandic, and Turkish show up to 30% annotation savings and a performance boost of up to 4 F1 score points, along with more stable fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Incorporating clustering and AL scheduling in fine-tuning low-resource models improves performance while reducing the need for extensive dataset annotations.

Abstract: Limited data for low-resource languages typically yield weaker language models (LMs). Since pre-training is compute-intensive, it is more pragmatic to target improvements during fine-tuning. In this work, we examine the use of Active Learning (AL) methods augmented by structured data selection strategies which we term 'Active Learning schedulers', to boost the fine-tuning process with a limited amount of training data. We connect the AL to data clustering and propose an integrated fine-tuning pipeline that systematically combines AL, clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to enhance model's performance. Experiments in the Slovak, Maltese, Icelandic and Turkish languages show that the use of clustering during the fine-tuning phase together with AL scheduling can simultaneously produce annotation savings up to 30% and performance improvements up to four F1 score points, while also providing better fine-tuning stability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MCAT framework, addressing limitations in language coverage and efficiency for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current S2TT tasks are limited by English-centric datasets and inefficiencies in processing long speech sequences, hindering the many-to-many translation scalability of MLLMs.

Method: The MCAT framework employs a language scaling method with curriculum learning and data balancing to support multilingual translation in 70 languages. Additionally, it employs an optimized speech adapter module to greatly reduce token sequence lengths.

Result: MCAT demonstrated superior translation performance across 70x69 directions and improved batch inference efficiency while using only ~100M parameters and minimal data – 10 hours of S2TT data per language.

Conclusion: The research advances many-to-many S2TT capabilities with improvements in efficiency and language coverage, setting a new benchmark and releasing its implementation as open-source.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved great success in Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) tasks. However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/m2m-70.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates the challenges of detecting African languages (Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, Amharic) on digital platforms, with a focus on Reddit data and local news sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of effective language detection tools and training data for African languages due to sparse online content and code-switching dynamics.

Method: The authors collected data from subreddits and local news sources, comparing the characteristics of each dataset while testing language detection models' performance.

Result: Reddit data was minimal and heavily code-switched, while local news media offered clean and monolingual data. Detection models performed well on news data but struggled with Reddit's code-switched content.

Conclusion: Professionally curated news content is a better source for training AI models for African languages, and there is a need for models capable of handling both clean and code-switched texts.

Abstract: This study examines the digital representation of African languages and the challenges this presents for current language detection tools. We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages. Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts. The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms. It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new SLU dataset, MAC-SLU, for multi-intent automotive cabin scenarios, and benchmarks its performance using various approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating a unified benchmark for the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) in SLU tasks, given the lack of existing datasets with sufficient complexity and diversity.

Method: A novel dataset, MAC-SLU, is developed, incorporating complex multi-intent data. Benchmarks are conducted using in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, end-to-end, and pipeline paradigms with leading LLMs and LALMs.

Result: LLMs and LALMs can perform SLU tasks via in-context learning but underperform compared to supervised fine-tuning. End-to-end LALMs perform comparably to pipeline approaches and avoid error propagation.

Conclusion: MAC-SLU enhances SLU task complexity and diversity, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of SLU methods. End-to-end LALMs are promising for avoiding error propagation in speech recognition tasks.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), which aims to extract user semantics to execute downstream tasks, is a crucial component of task-oriented dialog systems. Existing SLU datasets generally lack sufficient diversity and complexity, and there is an absence of a unified benchmark for the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). This work introduces MAC-SLU, a novel Multi-Intent Automotive Cabin Spoken Language Understanding Dataset, which increases the difficulty of the SLU task by incorporating authentic and complex multi-intent data. Based on MAC-SLU, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark of leading open-source LLMs and LALMs, covering methods like in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and end-to-end (E2E) and pipeline paradigms. Our experiments show that while LLMs and LALMs have the potential to complete SLU tasks through in-context learning, their performance still lags significantly behind SFT. Meanwhile, E2E LALMs demonstrate performance comparable to pipeline approaches and effectively avoid error propagation from speech recognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to enhance LLM reliability by solving feasible problems, detecting contradictions, and refusing tasks beyond their competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models are prone to overconfidence and hallucinations due to difficulties distinguishing unsolvable problems from ones beyond their capability.

Method: The authors create UnsolvableQA, a dataset combining programmatic logic puzzles and mathematically altered contradictions, and propose UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with a joint reward system for accuracy, unsolvability detection, and difficulty.

Result: Empirical evidence shows nearly perfect detection of unsolvability and improved accuracy on solvable problems while highlighting the risk of Capability Collapse in models not exposed to unsolvable data.

Conclusion: Explicit exposure to unsolvable data is essential for LLMs to avoid overconfidence and systematically improve their task performance.

Abstract: Ensuring LLM reliability requires not only solving complex problems but also recognizing when a problem is unsolvable. Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel "Reverse Construction" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident.

*Stefano Zeppieri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework, MMAG, organizing memory for LLMs into five interacting layers to enhance sustained relevance and personalization in conversations, implemented in the Heero agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with maintaining relevance, personalization, and continuity in extended interactions, unlike human memory systems, which use various forms of memory for communication.

Method: The paper proposes a five-layer memory structure based on cognitive psychology: conversational, long-term user, episodic, sensory/context-aware, and short-term working memory, with strategies for managing coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution.

Result: Implemented in the Heero agent, the MMAG framework incorporates encrypted long-term bios and conversational history, showing improved engagement and user retention.

Conclusion: MMAG lays the groundwork for memory-rich conversational agents that can better address human communication needs, though challenges like storage, retrieval, and privacy require further exploration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating coherent text within a single prompt but fall short in sustaining relevance, personalization, and continuity across extended interactions. Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised method for detecting borrowing in multilingual wordlists combining PMI similarities and contrastive phonetic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve and simplify borrowing detection in multilingual wordlists using self-supervised methods without requiring labeled data.

Method: A fully self-supervised method combining PMI similarities from a global model and contrastive phonetic feature vectors, with automatic threshold selection.

Result: PMI alone outperforms existing methods and combined approaches are competitive or better than supervised baselines. Ablation studies reveal key factors in performance.

Conclusion: The method is scalable, requires no manual supervision, and is available for researchers through a command-line tool.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully self-supervised approach to borrowing detection in multilingual wordlists. The method combines two sources of information: PMI similarities based on a global correspondence model and a lightweight contrastive component trained on phonetic feature vectors. It further includes an automatic procedure for selecting decision thresholds without requiring labeled data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PMI alone already improves over existing string similarity measures such as NED and SCA, and that the combined similarity performs on par with or better than supervised baselines. An ablation study highlights the importance of character encoding, temperature settings and augmentation strategies. The approach scales to datasets of different sizes, works without manual supervision and is provided with a command-line tool that allows researchers to conduct their own studies.

*Jiannan Guan,Qiguang Chen,Libo Qin,Dengyun Peng,Jinhao Liu,Liangyu Huo,Jian Xie,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with tasks requiring diverse solutions due to reasoning overconfidence, addressed by Long-CoT prompting and the cognitive-rigidity hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' poor performance in tasks requiring diverse answers caused by reasoning overconfidence.

Method: Development of MuSoBench, analyses of Short-CoT vs Long-CoT prompting, and attention-entropy studies to support the cognitive-rigidity hypothesis.

Result: Short-CoT shows reasoning overconfidence; Long-CoT improves with iterative exploration and reflection. Attention-entropy experiments support cognitive-rigidity.

Conclusion: Long-CoT reduces LLM reasoning overconfidence, promoting comprehensive evaluations beyond single-answer accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning tasks requiring a single correct answer, but they perform poorly in multi-solution tasks that require generating comprehensive and diverse answers. We attribute this limitation to \textbf{reasoning overconfidence}: a tendency to express undue certainty in an incomplete solution set. To examine the effect, we introduce \textit{MuSoBench}, a benchmark of multi-solution problems. Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths. An attention-entropy analysis offers preliminary support for this view. These findings provide tools for assessing the completeness of LLM reasoning and highlight the need to move evaluation beyond single-answer accuracy toward comprehensive exploration.

### [163] [Reasoning About the Unsaid: Misinformation Detection with Omission-Aware Graph Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01728)
*Zhengjia Wang,Danding Wang,Qiang Sheng,Jiaying Wu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmiGraph is a framework designed to detect misinformation by identifying omitted contents in news through a novel graph-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While misinformation detection has typically focused on fabricated content, this paper addresses the overlooked area of omission-based deception, which subtly misguides readers by leaving out critical information.

Method: The authors propose OmiGraph, a framework that constructs omission-aware graphs using contextual information from complementary perspectives. It models omission-oriented relations and uses novel message-passing and aggregation techniques to analyze omission patterns.

Result: OmiGraph shows significant improvements, outperforming baselines with a +5.4% F1-score and +5.3% accuracy on two large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: Considering omission-based deception effectively enhances misinformation detection, as demonstrated by OmiGraph's performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: This paper investigates the detection of misinformation, which deceives readers by explicitly fabricating misleading content or implicitly omitting important information necessary for informed judgment. While the former has been extensively studied, omission-based deception remains largely overlooked, even though it can subtly guide readers toward false conclusions under the illusion of completeness. To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces InnoGym, a benchmark and framework that evaluates AI agent innovation by considering both performance improvement and originality in solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus solely on correctness and overlook the importance of innovation and originality in AI solutions.

Method: The authors propose InnoGym, which includes 18 tasks from engineering and science domains, two metrics (performance gain and novelty), and a unified environment (iGym) for long-horizon evaluations.

Result: Experiments show that while AI agents demonstrate some creative approaches, their robustness often limits their performance gains, revealing a gap between creativity and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Benchmarks need to assess both creativity and effectiveness to truly measure the innovation potential of AI agents.

Abstract: LLMs and Agents have achieved impressive progress in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific discovery. However, existing benchmarks primarily measure correctness, overlooking the diversity of methods behind solutions. True innovation depends not only on producing correct answers but also on the originality of the approach. We present InnoGym, the first benchmark and framework designed to systematically evaluate the innovation potential of AI agents. InnoGym introduces two complementary metrics: performance gain, which measures improvement over the best-known solutions, and novelty, which captures methodological differences from prior approaches. The benchmark includes 18 carefully curated tasks from real-world engineering and scientific domains, each standardized through resource filtering, evaluator validation, and solution collection. In addition, we provide iGym, a unified execution environment for reproducible and long-horizon evaluations. Extensive experiments show that while some agents produce novel approaches, their lack of robustness limits performance gains. These results highlight a key gap between creativity and effectiveness, underscoring the need for benchmarks that evaluate both.

### [165] [Beyond SFT: Reinforcement Learning for Safer Large Reasoning Models with Better Reasoning Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01848)
*Jinghan Jia,Nathalie Baracaldo,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates reinforcement learning (RL) for safety training in large reasoning models (LRMs) to address the limitations of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and finds RL improves safety consistently while retaining reasoning ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the safety of LRMs, as unsafe behaviors often arise in their reasoning processes, which is inadequately addressed by existing SFT methods due to inconsistent improvements, degraded reasoning ability, and poor generalization.

Method: The authors explore reinforcement learning as an alternative optimization framework to train LRMs for safety alignment by directly optimizing model policies with reward feedback.

Result: Experiments show that RL achieves stronger, more consistent safety improvements compared to SFT while maintaining reasoning capabilities, even across different model families and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning offers a superior approach for safety alignment in LRMs, effectively suppressing unsafe reasoning trajectories without compromising reflective depth or reasoning competence.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) extend large language models by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, significantly improving mathematical and logical problem solving. However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes.

*Hrishikesh Terdalkar,Kirtan Bhojani,Aryan Dongare,Omm Aditya Behera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces BHRAM-IL, a benchmark to evaluate hallucination detection in multilingual large language models, focusing on Indian languages such as Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, and Odia. It covers 36,047 questions across 9 task categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language models are a challenge, particularly in multilingual applications, and existing detection methods lack focus on under-resourced Indian languages.

Method: The study creates BHRAM-IL, a curated dataset consisting of 36,047 benchmarked questions, evaluates 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, and employs normalized category-specific metrics for analysis.

Result: The evaluation reveals low aggregated scores (0.23 primary score, 0.385 language-corrected fuzzy score), underscoring the benchmark's utility in detecting hallucinations across models and languages.

Conclusion: BHRAM-IL provides a valuable resource for studying and mitigating hallucinations in multilingual applications, particularly for Indian languages, facilitating further research through accessible datasets and tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual applications but often generate plausible yet incorrect or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. While hallucination detection has been studied extensively in English, under-resourced Indian languages remain largely unexplored. We present BHRAM-IL, a benchmark for hallucination recognition and assessment in multiple Indian languages, covering Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, along with English. The benchmark comprises 36,047 curated questions across nine categories spanning factual, numerical, reasoning, and linguistic tasks. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs on a benchmark subset of 10,265 questions, analyzing cross-lingual and factual hallucinations across languages, models, scales, categories, and domains using category-specific metrics normalized to (0,1) range. Aggregation over all categories and models yields a primary score of 0.23 and a language-corrected fuzzy score of 0.385, demonstrating the usefulness of BHRAM-IL for hallucination-focused evaluation. The dataset, and the code for generation and evaluation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) and HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) to support future research in multilingual hallucination detection and mitigation.

### [167] [Cross-Lingual Interleaving for Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01865)
*Adel Moumen,Guangzhi Sun,Philip C. Woodland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cross-lingual interleaving method and new resources for building multilingual Spoken Language Models (SLMs), focusing on non-English languages using speech data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs aim to make NLP accessible for languages with limited textual resources, but research has been English-centric due to a lack of evaluation benchmarks and training data.

Method: The authors propose a cross-lingual interleaving method to mix speech tokens from multiple languages and release EN-FR datasets and evaluation benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic tasks.

Result: Cross-lingual interleaving improves monolingual semantic accuracy, cross-lingual continuation, and hidden-state alignment in SLMs, demonstrated on 360M and 1B parameter models.

Conclusion: The introduced method and resources provide a scalable way to create multilingual SLMs capable of understanding and conversing across languages, with all resources being open-sourced.

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn linguistic competence directly from speech using discrete units, widening access to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for languages with limited written resources. However, progress has been largely English-centric due to scarce spoken evaluation benchmarks and training data, making cross-lingual learning difficult. We present a cross-lingual interleaving method that mixes speech tokens across languages without textual supervision. We also release an EN-FR training dataset, TinyStories (~42k hours), together with EN-FR spoken StoryCloze and TopicCloze benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic evaluation, both synthetically generated using GPT-4. On 360M and 1B SLMs under matched training-token budgets, interleaving improves monolingual semantic accuracy, enables robust cross-lingual continuation, and strengthens cross-lingual hidden-state alignment. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-lingual interleaving is a simple, scalable route to building multilingual SLMs that understand and converse across languages. All resources will be made open-source to support reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how human perceptions influence evaluations of generative AI responses and introduces new metrics for mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand human perceptions on the effectiveness of mitigation strategies for generative AI and their responses across faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal, and relevance dimensions.

Method: Conducted a mixed-method experiment with 57 participants who evaluated mitigated AI responses under two conditions, using a within-subject study design.

Result: Findings showed participants' evaluations were influenced by native language, AI experience, and annotation familiarity. They favored preserved semantic context and were sensitive to linguistic details.

Conclusion: Human evaluations differ significantly from quantitative measures used for LLMs, emphasizing the need for human-centric metrics and guidelines for evaluating mitigation strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid uptake of generative AI, investigating human perceptions of generated responses has become crucial. A major challenge is their `aptitude' for hallucinating and generating harmful contents. Despite major efforts for implementing guardrails, human perceptions of these mitigation strategies are largely unknown. We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated system for generating and evaluating Online Public Opinion Reports (OPOR) for crisis management and provides a new dataset (OPOR-BENCH) and evaluation framework (OPOR-EVAL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for timely and accurate crisis management reports from news and social media sources, and the lack of formal research, task definitions, and benchmarks in this area.

Method: The paper defines the OPOR-GEN task which involves generating reports from news and social media. It constructs a dataset (OPOR-BENCH) with 463 crisis events and introduces an evaluation framework (OPOR-EVAL) to simulate human evaluation.

Result: Frontier language models were tested using the new framework, and the evaluation method highly correlated with human judgment.

Conclusion: The research lays a foundational framework for automated public opinion report generation and evaluation, aiding future developments in crisis management tools.

Abstract: Online Public Opinion Reports consolidate news and social media for timely crisis management by governments and enterprises. While large language models have made automated report generation technically feasible, systematic research in this specific area remains notably absent, particularly lacking formal task definitions and corresponding benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we define the Automated Online Public Opinion Report Generation (OPOR-GEN) task and construct OPOR-BENCH, an event-centric dataset covering 463 crisis events with their corresponding news articles, social media posts, and a reference summary. To evaluate report quality, we propose OPOR-EVAL, a novel agent-based framework that simulates human expert evaluation by analyzing generated reports in context. Experiments with frontier models demonstrate that our framework achieves high correlation with human judgments. Our comprehensive task definition, benchmark dataset, and evaluation framework provide a solid foundation for future research in this critical domain.

### [170] [Latent Debate: A Surrogate Framework for Interpreting LLM Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01909)
*Lihu Chen,Xiang Yin,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'latent debate,' a framework to interpret Large Language Models (LLMs) by identifying implicit internal arguments during single inference, providing insights into hallucination detection and understanding model behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper lies in addressing the challenge of interpreting large language models' internal reasoning processes and identifying the origins of hallucinations.

Method: The authors propose a 'latent debate' framework that captures hidden supporting and attacking signals within a single model during inference, contrasting current methods based on explicit model debates. They develop a conceptual model-agnostic framework and apply it symbolically to approximate LLM thinking on True/False tasks.

Result: Empirical studies show the latent debate framework is a faithful and structured surrogate model that aligns closely with LLM predictions. Additionally, it offers a strong baseline for detecting hallucinations and reveals patterns linking internal debate intensity with hallucination risks.

Conclusion: Latent debate offers a promising approach to understanding the internal mechanisms of LLMs, particularly regarding internal agreements and disagreements during inference, with significant implications for interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RePro, a post-training approach to refine the reasoning process of large language models (LLMs) during chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning using a novel process-level reward mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address suboptimal reasoning behaviors in LLMs, such as overthinking and excessively long reasoning chains, which hinder performance despite advancements in long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

Method: The paper introduces RePro, which frames CoT reasoning steps as a gradient descent process and deploys a surrogate objective function to evaluate reasoning intensity and stability via a dual scoring mechanism. These are used as process-level rewards in reinforcement learning pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments across various reinforcement learning algorithms and LLMs on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that RePro enhances reasoning performance and reduces detrimental reasoning behaviors.

Conclusion: RePro offers a systematic method to improve the reasoning quality of LLMs, effectively mitigating overthinking and enhancing overall performance during chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by their emergent reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which enables thorough exploration and deliberation. Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced benchmark, FINDER, for better assessing Deep Research Agents (DRAs) and proposes DEFT, a taxonomy identifying key failure modes of DRAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRAs focus on question-answering rather than producing comprehensive reports, and available benchmarks lack user-aligned complexity and reliable scoring systems.

Method: The authors created FINDER with 100 curated research tasks and 419 structured checklist items to standardize report evaluation, and developed DEFT, a taxonomy with 14 failure modes identified using grounded theory and human-LLM collaboration.

Result: Analysis of 1,000 reports reveals that DRAs perform poorly in evidence integration, verification, and reasoning, but not task comprehension.

Conclusion: FINDER and DEFT provide a robust framework to evaluate and improve DRAs in generating comprehensive and accurate reports.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) aim to automatically produce analyst-level reports through iterative information retrieval and synthesis. However, most existing DRAs were validated on question-answering benchmarks, while research on generating comprehensive reports remains overlooked. Worse, current benchmarks for report synthesis suffer from task complexity and subjective metrics -- this fails to reflect user demands and limits the practical utility of generated reports. To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation. Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning.

TL;DR: The paper explores test-time scaling (TTS) in large language models, providing a comprehensive comparison of strategies and offering a practical guide to optimal inference scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic comparison of test-time scaling strategies under identical conditions and examine the influence of model type and problem difficulty on reasoning performance in large language models.

Method: Conducted a large-scale study analyzing over thirty billion tokens generated by eight open-source LLMs (across sizes of 7B to 235B parameters) and evaluated them on four reasoning datasets.

Result: Identified three trends: (1) no universal TTS strategy dominates; (2) models have different trace-quality patterns linked to problem difficulty; and (3) optimal performance scales with compute budget for a specific model type.

Conclusion: The findings yield a practical framework for selecting TTS strategies based on problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, enhancing the effectiveness of inference-time scaling in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) -- the dynamic allocation of compute during inference -- is a promising direction for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, a systematic comparison of well-known TTS strategies under identical conditions is missing, and the influence of model type and problem difficulty on performance remains unclear. To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling.

*Jack Cook,Junxian Guo,Guangxuan Xiao,Yujun Lin,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Four Over Six (4/6)', a modification to NVFP4 quantization, which improves training and inference for large language models by addressing issues with quantization error, particularly in near-maximal values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve speed and memory efficiency in large language models using low-precision numerical formats while mitigating training divergence and performance degradation caused by quantization errors in NVFP4.

Method: 'Four Over Six (4/6)' is proposed as a new quantization technique that evaluates two scale factors for blocks of values, optimizing the representation of near-maximal values and ensuring uniformity. This method is compatible with NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and can be integrated into training and post-training quantization.

Result: The 4/6 method significantly reduces divergence, improves training loss closer to BF16 levels, and enhances downstream accuracy across different pre-training and hybrid model architectures.

Conclusion: The 4/6 quantization method is a viable solution to improve training stability and inference quality for models using NVFP4, offering a practical tool for better deploying large language models.

Abstract: As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fast, accurate, and efficient gesture recognition in human-computer interaction and medical monitoring applications using small wearable devices.

Method: The study uses triaxial accelerometer sensors, AutoML pipelines to extract features, and lightweight machine learning models trained on the extracted features. The WeBe Band wearable device was used for implementation.

Result: The neural network model proved the most effective, achieving a balance between accuracy, latency, and memory use. Reliable real-time gesture recognition was demonstrated successfully on the WeBe Band.

Conclusion: The method shows strong potential for secure and fast real-time medical monitoring solutions, advancing the field of embedded gesture recognition systems.

Abstract: The use of tiny devices capable of low-latency gesture recognition is gaining momentum in everyday human-computer interaction and especially in medical monitoring fields. Embedded solutions such as fall detection, rehabilitation tracking, and patient supervision require fast and efficient tracking of movements while avoiding unwanted false alarms. This study presents an efficient solution on how to build very efficient motion-based models only using triaxial accelerometer sensors. We explore the capability of the AutoML pipelines to extract the most important features from the data segments. This approach also involves training multiple lightweight machine learning algorithms using the extracted features. We use WeBe Band, a multi-sensor wearable device that is equipped with a powerful enough MCU to effectively perform gesture recognition entirely on the device. Of the models explored, we found that the neural network provided the best balance between accuracy, latency, and memory use. Our results also demonstrate that reliable real-time gesture recognition can be achieved in WeBe Band, with great potential for real-time medical monitoring solutions that require a secure and fast response time.

*Egemen Sert,Şeyda Ertekin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality multimodal data can achieve near state-of-the-art performance in vision-language reasoning, emphasizing the importance of data composition and syntax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the underexplored data-centric foundations of vision-language reasoning in contrast to the focus on purely algorithmic approaches.

Method: The researchers compiled a 161.4 million token dataset with textbook question-solution pairs, diagrams, and contextual materials, then fine-tuned a model (Qwen-2.5VL-32B) with an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA).

Result: The fine-tuned model achieved 78.6% accuracy on a new benchmark (YKSUniform), which is only 1% below a proprietary approach, Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Conclusion: Curated multimodal data and tailored representational syntax can significantly improve supervised fine-tuning, advancing open-weight vision-language models towards state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers. While recent progress has largely focused on algorithmic advances such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO, DPO), the data centric foundations of vision language reasoning remain less explored.
  We show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches. To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics.
  Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer globally has led to the development of various computer-aided detection methods. Accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules is a critical first step in the development of AI-assisted clinical decision support systems. This study focuses on instance segmentation of thyroid nodules using YOLOv5 algorithms on ultrasound images. We evaluated multiple YOLOv5 variants (Nano, Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge) across two dataset versions, with and without doppler images. The YOLOv5-Large algorithm achieved the highest performance with a dice score of 91\% and mAP of 0.87 on the dataset including doppler images. Notably, our results demonstrate that doppler images, typically excluded by physicians, can significantly improve segmentation performance. The YOLOv5-Small model achieved 79\% dice score when doppler images were excluded, while including them improved performance across all model variants. These findings suggest that instance segmentation with YOLOv5 provides an effective real-time approach for thyroid nodule detection, with potential clinical applications in automated diagnostic systems.

*Sreesritha Sai,Sai Venkata Suma Sreeja,Deepthi,Nikhil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep-learning framework for accurate post-disaster damage assessment utilizing satellite imagery with improved performance over traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual satellite image interpretation for disaster damage is slow, biased, and difficult to scale. Existing deep learning models struggle with subtle changes and imbalanced classes in disaster datasets.

Method: The proposed method uses a modified dual-input U-Net architecture for pre- and post-disaster images. Enhanced feature fusion and class-aware weighted loss functions are integrated to improve sensitivity to damaged areas.

Result: The framework shows improved accuracy in detecting and classifying structural damage compared to traditional segmentation and change-detection models using public disaster datasets.

Conclusion: The model provides faster and more consistent damage assessments for aiding expert decision-making and enhancing disaster management efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate post-disaster damage assessment is of high importance for prioritizing emergency response; however, manual interpretation of satellite imagery is slow, subjective, and hard to scale. While deep-learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net-based baselines and change-detection models, are useful baselines, they often struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, yielding poor detection of highly damaged regions. The present work proposes a deep-learning framework that jointly processes pre- and post-disaster satellite images to obtain fine-grained pixel-level damage maps: Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator. The model uses a modified dual-input U-Net architecture with enhanced feature fusion to capture both the local structural changes as well as the broader contextual cues. Class-aware weighted loss functions are integrated in order to handle the dominance of undamaged pixels in real disaster datasets, thus enhancing sensitivity toward major and destroyed categories. Experimentation on publicly available disaster datasets shows improved localization and classification of structural damage when compared to traditional segmentation and baseline change-detection models. The resulting damage maps provide a rapid and consistent assessment mechanism to support and not replace expert decision-making, thus allowing more efficient, data-driven disaster management.

*Aswinkumar Varathakumaran,Nirmala Paramanandham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving night-time vehicle detection under adverse weather conditions via a noise-robust pipeline called ProvRain using a MobileNet-U-Net architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the accuracy of night-time vehicle detection by addressing challenges posed by weather and camera noise, particularly during rainy conditions.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline called ProvRain, which employs a MobileNet-U-Net architecture combined with curricula training, using both synthetic and real data from the PVDN dataset.

Result: The proposed system achieves an 8.94% boost in accuracy and a 10.25% increase in recall for vehicle detection under rainy nighttime conditions, and significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual error over other methods.

Conclusion: ProvRain demonstrates the effectiveness of a tailored architecture and training strategy to counteract noise and improve vehicle detection performance in challenging environmental scenarios.

Abstract: Provident vehicle detection has a lot of scope in the detection of vehicle during night time. The extraction of features other than the headlamps of vehicles allows us to detect oncoming vehicles before they appear directly on the camera. However, it faces multiple issues especially in the field of night vision, where a lot of noise caused due to weather conditions such as rain or snow as well as camera conditions. This paper focuses on creating a pipeline aimed at dealing with such noise while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of provident vehicular detection. The pipeline in this paper, ProvRain, uses a lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture tuned to generalize to robust weather conditions by using the concept of curricula training. A mix of synthetic as well as available data from the PVDN dataset is used for this. This pipeline is compared to the base Faster RCNN architecture trained on the PVDN dataset to see how much the addition of a denoising architecture helps increase the detection model's performance in rainy conditions. The system boasts an 8.94\% increase in accuracy and a 10.25\% increase in recall in the detection of vehicles in rainy night time frames. Similarly, the custom MobileNet-U-Net architecture that was trained also shows a 10-15\% improvement in PSNR, a 5-6\% increase in SSIM, and upto a 67\% reduction in perceptual error (LPIPS) compared to other transformer approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adapter Shield, a solution designed to prevent unauthorized misuse of personal images in zero-shot image synthesis by encrypting image embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing misuse of advanced zero-shot image synthesis techniques that replicate identities or styles, posing risks such as intellectual property violations.

Method: The approach involves a reversible encryption system to transform and secure image embeddings, with decryption for authorized users, plus an adversarial perturbation mechanism to block unauthorized synthesis.

Result: Extensive evaluations showcase that Adapter Shield effectively blocks unauthorized image synthesis and supports secure access for verified users.

Conclusion: Adapter Shield offers a universal and authentication-integrated defense, balancing protection from misuse while enabling secure generation for authorized users.

Abstract: With the rapid progress in diffusion models, image synthesis has advanced to the stage of zero-shot image-to-image generation, where high-fidelity replication of facial identities or artistic styles can be achieved using just one portrait or artwork, without modifying any model weights. Although these techniques significantly enhance creative possibilities, they also pose substantial risks related to intellectual property violations, including unauthorized identity cloning and stylistic imitation. To counter such threats, this work presents Adapter Shield, the first universal and authentication-integrated solution aimed at defending personal images from misuse in zero-shot generation scenarios. We first investigate how current zero-shot methods employ image encoders to extract embeddings from input images, which are subsequently fed into the UNet of diffusion models through cross-attention layers. Inspired by this mechanism, we construct a reversible encryption system that maps original embeddings into distinct encrypted representations according to different secret keys. The authorized users can restore the authentic embeddings via a decryption module and the correct key, enabling normal usage for authorized generation tasks. For protection purposes, we design a multi-target adversarial perturbation method that actively shifts the original embeddings toward designated encrypted patterns. Consequently, protected images are embedded with a defensive layer that ensures unauthorized users can only produce distorted or encrypted outputs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art defenses in blocking unauthorized zero-shot image synthesis, while supporting flexible and secure access control for verified users.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks hindering the progress of deep learning methods for accurate single cell detection in brightfield microscopy.

Method: The authors train a U-Net based diffusion model to generate synthetic microscopy images. They evaluate datasets containing different synthetic-to-real image ratios using object detection models like YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and RT-DETR.

Result: Training with synthetic data improves detection accuracies while reducing costs. A human expert survey confirms the high realism of generated images, as experts were unable to distinguish them from real images.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based synthetic data generation effectively augments real microscopy datasets, reducing manual annotation efforts and potentially boosting cell detection model robustness.

Abstract: Accurate single cell detection in brightfield microscopy is crucial for biological research, yet data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks limit the progress of deep learning methods. We investigate the use of unconditional models to generate synthetic brightfield microscopy images and evaluate their impact on object detection performance. A U-Net based diffusion model was trained and used to create datasets with varying ratios of synthetic and real images. Experiments with YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and RT-DETR reveal that training with synthetic data can achieve improved detection accuracies (at minimal costs). A human expert survey demonstrates the high realism of generated images, with experts not capable to distinguish them from real microscopy images (accuracy 50%). Our findings suggest that diffusion-based synthetic data generation is a promising avenue for augmenting real datasets in microscopy image analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation and potentially improving the robustness of cell detection models.

*André Dehne,Juri Zach,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) as an alternative navigation approach for the MARWIN robot in accelerator tunnels, addressing challenges of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the MARWIN robot's navigation capabilities in monotonous, radiation-prone accelerator tunnels where traditional localization approaches struggle.

Method: Utilizing DVSO which is a vision-based method combining stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to estimate depth and ego-motion, along with integration of geometric constraints and potential sensor fusion.

Result: Conceptual evaluation of DVSO in accelerator environments like the European XFEL shows potential benefits such as reduced scale drift and cost-efficiency, though challenges like low-light textures and computational demands remain.

Conclusion: DVSO offers a promising direction for improving MARWIN's autonomy, but further research is needed to overcome environmental and computational challenges for dependable deployment in safety-critical settings.

Abstract: The MARWIN robot operates at the European XFEL to perform autonomous radiation monitoring in long, monotonous accelerator tunnels where conventional localization approaches struggle. Its current navigation concept combines lidar-based edge detection, wheel/lidar odometry with periodic QR-code referencing, and fuzzy control of wall distance, rotation, and longitudinal position. While robust in predefined sections, this design lacks flexibility for unknown geometries and obstacles. This paper explores deep visual stereo odometry (DVSO) with 3D-geometric constraints as a focused alternative. DVSO is purely vision-based, leveraging stereo disparity, optical flow, and self-supervised learning to jointly estimate depth and ego-motion without labeled data. For global consistency, DVSO can subsequently be fused with absolute references (e.g., landmarks) or other sensors. We provide a conceptual evaluation for accelerator tunnel environments, using the European XFEL as a case study. Expected benefits include reduced scale drift via stereo, low-cost sensing, and scalable data collection, while challenges remain in low-texture surfaces, lighting variability, computational load, and robustness under radiation. The paper defines a research agenda toward enabling MARWIN to navigate more autonomously in constrained, safety-critical infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in MLLM reliability when evaluating visual complexity and align models closer to human expert evaluations.

Method: Using 200 Amazon SRP pages, human expert annotations, and comparing standard gestalt vs. diagnostic prompting approaches.

Result: Diagnostic prompting improved prediction accuracy by 858% (F1 score: 0.297), though absolute reliability remains low (Cohen's κ = 0.071). Models and humans differ in visual reasoning priorities.

Conclusion: Diagnostic prompting offers potential for better alignment with human evaluation, but further research on MLLM visual perception and larger datasets is needed for practical use.

Abstract: This study investigates whether diagnostic prompting can improve Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) reliability for visual complexity assessment of Amazon Search Results Pages (SRP). We compare diagnostic prompting with standard gestalt principles-based prompting using 200 Amazon SRP pages and human expert annotations. Diagnostic prompting showed notable improvements in predicting human complexity judgments, with F1-score increasing from 0.031 to 0.297 (+858\% relative improvement), though absolute performance remains modest (Cohen's $κ$ = 0.071). The decision tree revealed that models prioritize visual design elements (badge clutter: 38.6\% importance) while humans emphasize content similarity, suggesting partial alignment in reasoning patterns. Failure case analysis reveals persistent challenges in MLLM visual perception, particularly for product similarity and color intensity assessment. Our findings indicate that diagnostic prompting represents a promising initial step toward human-aligned MLLM-based evaluation, though failure cases with consistent human-MLLM disagreement require continued research and refinement in prompting approaches with larger ground truth datasets for reliable practical deployment.

*Venkata Siddharth Dhara,Pawan Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FastTextDiff, a label-efficient segmentation model using ModernBERT to leverage medical text annotations for improving medical image segmentation and representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation in medical imaging is limited by the high cost and expertise required for dense pixel-wise labels, prompting the need for label-efficient methods.

Method: FastTextDiff integrates medical text annotations with image data using ModernBERT, which encodes clinical knowledge and employs advanced attention mechanisms with a vast token corpus to improve efficiency.

Result: ModernBERT demonstrated improved segmentation accuracy and training efficiency compared to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: FastTextDiff and ModernBERT showcase the potential of multi-modal approaches for enhancing medical image analysis, being both scalable and efficient alternatives for clinical applications.

Abstract: In recent times, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have proven effective for medical image generation and denoising, and as representation learners for downstream segmentation. However, segmentation performance is limited by the need for dense pixel-wise labels, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. We propose FastTextDiff, a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations. Our approach uses ModernBERT, a transformer capable of processing long clinical notes, to tightly link textual annotations with semantic content in medical images. Trained on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, ModernBERT encodes clinical knowledge that guides cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. This study validates ModernBERT as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines and highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis. By replacing Clinical BioBERT with ModernBERT, FastTextDiff benefits from FlashAttention 2, an alternating attention mechanism, and a 2-trillion-token corpus, improving both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a domain-shift adaptive monocular depth estimation framework using a tiny deep learning model that performs on-device learning, specifically designed for ultra-low-power IoT platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT platforms with limited deep learning model parameters face accuracy drops when their environment shifts, necessitating adaptive methods for domain adjustment.

Method: A multi-modal on-device learning technique with a memory-driven sparse update scheme is used, deployed on an IoT device equipped with a miniature depth sensor, monocular camera, and a GAP9 MicroController Unit.

Result: The proposed system fine-tunes the model on-device with new data, achieving significant improvements on datasets like KITTI and NYUv2, reducing memory consumption and inference errors.

Conclusion: On-device learning for monocular depth estimation in IoT is feasible, efficient, and leads to remarkable accuracy enhancement in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a crucial role in enabling spatially-aware applications in Ultra-low-power (ULP) Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. However, the limited number of parameters of Deep Neural Networks for the MDE task, designed for IoT nodes, results in severe accuracy drops when the sensor data observed in the field shifts significantly from the training dataset. To address this domain shift problem, we present a multi-modal On-Device Learning (ODL) technique, deployed on an IoT device integrating a Greenwaves GAP9 MicroController Unit (MCU), a 80 mW monocular camera and a 8 x 8 pixel depth sensor, consuming $\approx$300mW. In its normal operation, this setup feeds a tiny 107 k-parameter $μ$PyD-Net model with monocular images for inference. The depth sensor, usually deactivated to minimize energy consumption, is only activated alongside the camera to collect pseudo-labels when the system is placed in a new environment. Then, the fine-tuning task is performed entirely on the MCU, using the new data. To optimize our backpropagation-based on-device training, we introduce a novel memory-driven sparse update scheme, which minimizes the fine-tuning memory to 1.2 MB, 2.2x less than a full update, while preserving accuracy (i.e., only 2% and 1.5% drops on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets). Our in-field tests demonstrate, for the first time, that ODL for MDE can be performed in 17.8 minutes on the IoT node, reducing the root mean squared error from 4.9 to 0.6m with only 3 k self-labeled samples, collected in a real-life deployment scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early lung cancer diagnosis despite the challenges of delayed detection due to dependency on size and growth measurement.

Method: An ensemble of specialized shallow deep learning and feature-based models trained on 25,709 scans with annotated nodules, aiming to enhance performance, scalability, and explainability.

Result: The AI achieved an AUC of 0.98 internally and 0.945 externally, outperforming radiologists and leading AI systems across various metrics, especially in early-stage and indeterminate tumors.

Conclusion: The system sets a new standard for lung cancer screening, accelerating early diagnosis, reducing false positives, and outshining human and AI peers in diverse conditions.

Abstract: Early detection of malignant lung nodules is critical, but its dependence on size and growth in screening inherently delays diagnosis. We present an AI system that redefines lung cancer screening by performing both detection and malignancy diagnosis directly at the nodule level on low-dose CT scans. To address limitations in dataset scale and explainability, we designed an ensemble of shallow deep learning and feature-based specialized models. Trained and evaluated on 25,709 scans with 69,449 annotated nodules, the system outperforms radiologists, Lung-RADS, and leading AI models (Sybil, Brock, Google, Kaggle). It achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98 internally and 0.945 on an independent cohort. With 0.5 false positives per scan at 99.3\% sensitivity, it addresses key barriers to AI adoption. Critically, it outperforms radiologists across all nodule sizes and stages, excelling in stage 1 cancers, and all growth-based metrics, including the least accurate: Volume-Doubling Time. It also surpasses radiologists by up to one year in diagnosing indeterminate and slow-growing nodules.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the potential of AI-driven automated classroom analysis as a scalable solution, serving as a stepping stone for effective teacher feedback systems.

Abstract: Observation of classroom interactions can provide concrete feedback to teachers, but current methods rely on manual annotation, which is resource-intensive and hard to scale. This work explores AI-driven analysis of classroom recordings, focusing on multimodal instructional activity and discourse recognition as a foundation for actionable feedback. Using a densely annotated dataset of 164 hours of video and 68 lesson transcripts, we design parallel, modality-specific pipelines. For video, we evaluate zero-shot multimodal LLMs, fine-tuned vision-language models, and self-supervised video transformers on 24 activity labels. For transcripts, we fine-tune a transformer-based classifier with contextualized inputs and compare it against prompting-based LLMs on 19 discourse labels. To handle class imbalance and multi-label complexity, we apply per-label thresholding, context windows, and imbalance-aware loss functions. The results show that fine-tuned models consistently outperform prompting-based approaches, achieving macro-F1 scores of 0.577 for video and 0.460 for transcripts. These results demonstrate the feasibility of automated classroom analysis and establish a foundation for scalable teacher feedback systems.

### [190] [SemImage: Semantic Image Representation for Text, a Novel Framework for Embedding Disentangled Linguistic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00088)
*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'SemImage', which represents text as a 2D semantic image for CNN processing, achieving competitive document classification performance with added interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a novel, interpretable way of representing textual data for deep learning, leveraging 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in tasks traditionally dominated by text-based architectures.

Method: The authors propose SemImage, where text is converted into a 2D image with words as pixels in an HSV color space encoding linguistic features (topic, sentiment, intensity). A multi-task learning framework is applied, including auxiliary tasks to encode additional information. Dynamic boundary rows visually separate semantically distinct sentences. Standard 2D CNNs process the resulting image representation.

Result: SemImage demonstrates competitive or superior accuracy on text classification benchmarks compared to strong baselines like BERT. It also offers clearer interpretability than traditional methods. Ablation studies validate the proposed design components.

Conclusion: SemImage is an effective and interpretable approach for document classification, providing a novel visualization of linguistic features and competitive performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: We propose SemImage, a novel method for representing a text document as a two-dimensional semantic image to be processed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In a SemImage, each word is represented as a pixel in a 2D image: rows correspond to sentences and an additional boundary row is inserted between sentences to mark semantic transitions. Each pixel is not a typical RGB value but a vector in a disentangled HSV color space, encoding different linguistic features: the Hue with two components H_cos and H_sin to account for circularity encodes the topic, Saturation encodes the sentiment, and Value encodes intensity or certainty. We enforce this disentanglement via a multi-task learning framework: a ColorMapper network maps each word embedding to the HSV space, and auxiliary supervision is applied to the Hue and Saturation channels to predict topic and sentiment labels, alongside the main task objective. The insertion of dynamically computed boundary rows between sentences yields sharp visual boundaries in the image when consecutive sentences are semantically dissimilar, effectively making paragraph breaks salient. We integrate SemImage with standard 2D CNNs (e.g., ResNet) for document classification. Experiments on multi-label datasets (with both topic and sentiment annotations) and single-label benchmarks demonstrate that SemImage can achieve competitive or better accuracy than strong text classification baselines (including BERT and hierarchical attention networks) while offering enhanced interpretability. An ablation study confirms the importance of the multi-channel HSV representation and the dynamic boundary rows. Finally, we present visualizations of SemImage that qualitatively reveal clear patterns corresponding to topic shifts and sentiment changes in the generated image, suggesting that our representation makes these linguistic features visible to both humans and machines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeleViT, a novel AI model, predicts wildfires weeks to months ahead by integrating local, global, and teleconnection data, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate and longer-term prediction of wildfires by incorporating fine-scale local data with global and teleconnection factors, addressing the limitations of existing short-term weather-based predictions.

Method: The method involves using TeleViT, a Vision Transformer-based model, that processes a fusion of local, global, and teleconnection data through an asymmetric tokenization strategy and transformer encoder-decoder architecture to improve wildfire forecasting.

Result: TeleViT outperforms baseline models (ViT, U-Net++) in predicting wildfires across time horizons, achieving higher AUPRC scores, especially in consistent fire regimes like African savannas.

Conclusion: TeleViT demonstrates the potential of integrating large-scale Earth-system data into forecasting, significantly extending wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales.

Abstract: Forecasting wildfires weeks to months in advance is difficult, yet crucial for planning fuel treatments and allocating resources. While short-term predictions typically rely on local weather conditions, long-term forecasting requires accounting for the Earth's interconnectedness, including global patterns and teleconnections. We introduce TeleViT, a Teleconnection-aware Vision Transformer that integrates (i) fine-scale local fire drivers, (ii) coarsened global fields, and (iii) teleconnection indices. This multi-scale fusion is achieved through an asymmetric tokenization strategy that produces heterogeneous tokens processed jointly by a transformer encoder, followed by a decoder that preserves spatial structure by mapping local tokens to their corresponding prediction patches.
  Using the global SeasFire dataset (2001-2021, 8-day resolution), TeleViT improves AUPRC performance over U-Net++, ViT, and climatology across all lead times, including horizons up to four months. At zero lead, TeleViT with indices and global inputs reaches AUPRC 0.630 (ViT 0.617, U-Net 0.620), at 16x8day lead (around 4 months), TeleViT variants using global input maintain 0.601-0.603 (ViT 0.582, U-Net 0.578), while surpassing the climatology (0.572) at all lead times. Regional results show the highest skill in seasonally consistent fire regimes, such as African savannas, and lower skill in boreal and arid regions. Attention and attribution analyses indicate that predictions rely mainly on local tokens, with global fields and indices contributing coarse contextual information. These findings suggest that architectures explicitly encoding large-scale Earth-system context can extend wildfire predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales.

*Karam Mawas,Mehdi Maboudi,Pedro Achanccaray,Markus Gerke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated quality control (QC) procedure for filament geometry in 3D concrete printing methods, enabling online and post-printing assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for sustainable and precise construction methods by enhancing QC in large-scale 3D concrete printing.

Method: Developing an automated QC workflow applicable to extrusion-based and shotcrete 3D printing methods, regardless of sensor type (e.g., camera, structured light system, laser scanner).

Result: A versatile QC procedure that works with fresh and cured material states and can be implemented online or post-printing.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical solution for improving filament geometry quality in 3D concrete printing processes.

Abstract: The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is constantly evolving to meet the demand for sustainable and effective design and construction of the built environment. In the literature, two primary deposition techniques for large-scale 3D concrete printing (3DCP) have been described, namely extrusion-based (Contour Crafting-CC) and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP) methods. The deposition methods use a digitally controlled nozzle to print material layer by layer. The continuous flow of concrete material used to create the printed structure is called a filament or layer. As these filaments are the essential structure defining the printed object, the filaments' geometry quality control is crucial. This paper presents an automated procedure for quality control (QC) of filaments in extrusion-based and SC3DP printing methods. The paper also describes a workflow that is independent of the sensor used for data acquisition, such as a camera, a structured light system (SLS) or a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). This method can be used with materials in either the fresh or cured state. Thus, it can be used for online and post-printing QC.

*Ifeanyi Okala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates VGG16, ViT-B/16, and CoAtNet-Tiny for depression, schizophrenia, and healthy control detection from actigraphy images, finding CoAtNet-Tiny the most consistent and accurate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify which image-based machine learning method best classifies mental health conditions using actigraphy-derived images.

Method: Actigraphy records converted into images (30x48) from Psykose and Depresjon datasets, evaluated using a three-fold subject-wise split across VGG16, ViT-B/16, and CoAtNet-Tiny.

Result: CoAtNet-Tiny showed the best average accuracy, stability, and strongest metrics (precision, recall, F1), especially for underrepresented classes. VGG16 and ViT-B/16 had mixed and less consistent outcomes.

Conclusion: CoAtNet-Tiny demonstrates significant promise for mental health analyses using actigraphy-derived images due to its robust performance and consistency, while VGG16 and ViT-B/16 were less reliable.

Abstract: This work examines how three different image-based methods, VGG16, ViT-B/16, and CoAtNet-Tiny, perform in identifying depression, schizophrenia, and healthy controls using daily actigraphy records. Wrist-worn activity signals from the Psykose and Depresjon datasets were converted into 30 by 48 images and evaluated through a three-fold subject-wise split. Although all methods fitted the training data well, their behaviour on unseen data differed. VGG16 improved steadily but often settled at lower accuracy. ViT-B/16 reached strong results in some runs, but its performance shifted noticeably from fold to fold. CoAtNet-Tiny stood out as the most reliable, recording the highest average accuracy and the most stable curves across folds. It also produced the strongest precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly for the underrepresented depression and schizophrenia classes. Overall, the findings indicate that CoAtNet-Tiny performed most consistently on the actigraphy images, while VGG16 and ViT-B/16 yielded mixed results. These observations suggest that certain hybrid designs may be especially suited for mental-health work that relies on actigraphy-derived images.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'TinyViT,' a system combining deep learning with classical ML techniques for cost-effective solar fault detection and severity evaluation using visible light images, removing the need for expensive sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the logistical and economic challenges in detecting and categorizing surface faults of solar photovoltaic panels using minimal hardware resources and technologies accessible to all field conditions.

Method: The paper proposes the 'TinyViT' framework, using a Transformer-based segmentation model, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression techniques to analyze visible light images of panels.

Result: TinyViT successfully distinguishes and classifies seven surface fault types and provides actionable severity grades using low-cost, consumer-grade cameras, demonstrating accuracy and interpretability comparable to more resource-intensive methods.

Conclusion: The study advances solar health monitoring by eliminating reliance on specialized sensors, allowing scalable and affordable solar panel maintenance and universal accessibility for resource-limited installations.

Abstract: Sustained operation of solar photovoltaic assets hinges on accurate detection and prioritization of surface faults across vast, geographically distributed modules. While multi modal imaging strategies are popular, they introduce logistical and economic barriers for routine farm level deployment. This work demonstrates that deep learning and classical machine learning may be judiciously combined to achieve robust surface anomaly categorization and severity estimation from planar visible band imagery alone. We introduce TinyViT which is a compact pipeline integrating Transformer based segmentation, spectral-spatial feature engineering, and ensemble regression. The system ingests consumer grade color camera mosaics of PV panels, classifies seven nuanced surface faults, and generates actionable severity grades for maintenance triage. By eliminating reliance on electroluminescence or IR sensors, our method enables affordable, scalable upkeep for resource limited installations, and advances the state of solar health monitoring toward universal field accessibility. Experiments on real public world datasets validate both classification and regression sub modules, achieving accuracy and interpretability competitive with specialized approaches.

*Ruo-Syuan Mei,Sixian Jia,Guangze Li,Soo Yeon Lee,Brian Musser,William Keller,Sreten Zakula,Jorge Arinez,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid synthetic data generation framework for industrial quality inspection, generating large synthetic datasets for zero-shot learning and achieving superior performance without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of data scarcity, high costs of annotation, and severe class imbalance in training machine learning models for industrial quality inspection.

Method: The method combines simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and compositing synthetic parts onto real backgrounds to create a synthetic dataset for training a YOLOv8n- and MobileNetV3-based model.

Result: The model trained on synthetic data achieves high performance with an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy on real parts, outperforming few-shot real-data baselines significantly.

Conclusion: The hybrid synthetic data approach effectively addresses data-related barriers, enabling scalable, robust, and annotation-free machine learning-based quality inspection in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep learning, is transforming industrial quality inspection. Yet, training robust machine learning models typically requires large volumes of high-quality labeled data, which are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive to obtain in manufacturing. Moreover, defective samples are intrinsically rare, leading to severe class imbalance that degrades model performance. These data constraints hinder the widespread adoption of machine learning-based quality inspection methods in real production environments. Synthetic data generation (SDG) offers a promising solution by enabling the creation of large, balanced, and fully annotated datasets in an efficient, cost-effective, and scalable manner. This paper presents a hybrid SDG framework that integrates simulation-based rendering, domain randomization, and real background compositing to enable zero-shot learning for computer vision-based industrial part inspection without manual annotation. The SDG pipeline generates 12,960 labeled images in one hour by varying part geometry, lighting, and surface properties, and then compositing synthetic parts onto real image backgrounds. A two-stage architecture utilizing a YOLOv8n backbone for object detection and MobileNetV3-small for quality classification is trained exclusively on synthetic data and evaluated on 300 real industrial parts. The proposed approach achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.995 for detection, 96% classification accuracy, and 90.1% balanced accuracy. Comparative evaluation against few-shot real-data baseline approaches demonstrates significant improvement. The proposed SDG-based approach achieves 90-91% balanced accuracy under severe class imbalance, while the baselines reach only 50% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method enables annotation-free, scalable, and robust quality inspection for real-world manufacturing applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Out-of-Distribution (OOD) input issues in deep learning for breast cancer detection by combining ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures, achieving high accuracy and improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliability issues in breast cancer detection models caused by OOD inputs like imaging modality variations.

Method: The study integrates ResNet50-based OOD filtering preceding detection via YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12), using cosine similarity to exclude non-mammographic images and improve detection accuracy.

Result: Achieved 99.77% OOD detection accuracy, 100% accuracy on test OOD sets, and improved detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947), establishing reliability with Grad-CAM visualizations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework mitigates OOD issues and enhances the reliability and accuracy of breast cancer detection systems for diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Deep learning models for breast cancer detection from mammographic images have significant reliability problems when presented with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs such as other imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray) or equipment variations, leading to unreliable detection and misdiagnosis. The current research mitigates the fundamental OOD issue through a comprehensive approach integrating ResNet50-based OOD filtering with YOLO architectures (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, YOLOv12) for accurate detection of breast cancer. Our strategy establishes an in-domain gallery via cosine similarity to rigidly reject non-mammographic inputs prior to processing, ensuring that only domain-associated images supply the detection pipeline. The OOD detection component achieves 99.77\% general accuracy with immaculate 100\% accuracy on OOD test sets, effectively eliminating irrelevant imaging modalities. ResNet50 was selected as the optimum backbone after 12 CNN architecture searches. The joint framework unites OOD robustness with high detection performance (mAP@0.5: 0.947) and enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations. Experimental validation establishes that OOD filtering significantly improves system reliability by preventing false alarms on out-of-distribution inputs while maintaining higher detection accuracy on mammographic data. The present study offers a fundamental foundation for the deployment of reliable AI-based breast cancer detection systems in diverse clinical environments with inherent data heterogeneity.

### [197] [Local and Global Context-and-Object-part-Aware Superpixel-based Data Augmentation for Deep Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00130)
*Fadi Dornaika,Danyang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LGCOAMix, a novel superpixel-based data augmentation method that addresses limitations in existing cutmix strategies by leveraging local contextual and object-part information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cutmix-based data augmentation methods primarily rely on global semantics and rectangular/square region operations, resulting in performance bottlenecks and inefficiencies, such as the need for double forward propagation or external networks to resolve inconsistencies.

Method: The authors propose LGCOAMix, a superpixel-based grid blending method that uses superpixel attention to mix labels and extract local discriminative features, reducing inefficiencies and improving augmentation effectiveness.

Result: LGCOAMix demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art cutmix-based data augmentation methods on classification tasks and weakly supervised object location on the CUB200-2011 dataset across both CNN and Transformer networks.

Conclusion: LGCOAMix offers a significant improvement in cutmix-based data augmentation by effectively capturing discriminative local features using a superpixel-based approach, suitable for various deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Cutmix-based data augmentation, which uses a cut-and-paste strategy, has shown remarkable generalization capabilities in deep learning. However, existing methods primarily consider global semantics with image-level constraints, which excessively reduces attention to the discriminative local context of the class and leads to a performance improvement bottleneck. Moreover, existing methods for generating augmented samples usually involve cutting and pasting rectangular or square regions, resulting in a loss of object part information. To mitigate the problem of inconsistency between the augmented image and the generated mixed label, existing methods usually require double forward propagation or rely on an external pre-trained network for object centering, which is inefficient. To overcome the above limitations, we propose LGCOAMix, an efficient context-aware and object-part-aware superpixel-based grid blending method for data augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a label mixing strategy using a superpixel attention approach has been proposed for cutmix-based data augmentation. It is the first instance of learning local features from discriminative superpixel-wise regions and cross-image superpixel contrasts. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that LGCOAMix outperforms state-of-the-art cutmix-based data augmentation methods on classification tasks, {and weakly supervised object location on CUB200-2011.} We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LGCOAMix not only for CNN networks, but also for Transformer networks.

*Mohamed Abdallah Salem,Nourhan Zein Diab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight CNN for material recognition in laser cutting, achieving high accuracy and low computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve material recognition for laser cutting, addressing prior complexities and limitations in existing methods.

Method: Developed a lightweight CNN tailored for laser speckle pattern recognition, using the SensiCut dataset for testing.

Result: Achieved 95.05% test accuracy and enhanced material classification efficiency, with the model deployable on low-cost devices.

Conclusion: Domain-specific, efficient CNNs can outperform larger networks for material recognition in laser cutting, promoting edge-deployable systems.

Abstract: Accurate material recognition is critical for safe and effective laser cutting, as misidentification can lead to poor cut quality, machine damage, or the release of hazardous fumes. Laser speckle sensing has recently emerged as a low-cost and non-destructive modality for material classification; however, prior work has either relied on computationally expensive backbone networks or addressed only limited subsets of materials. In this study, A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) tailored for speckle patterns is proposed, designed to minimize parameters while maintaining high discriminative power. Using the complete SensiCut dataset of 59 material classes spanning woods, acrylics, composites, textiles, metals, and paper-based products, the proposed model achieves 95.05% test accuracy, with macro and weighted F1-scores of 0.951. The network contains only 341k trainable parameters (~1.3 MB) -- over 70X fewer than ResNet-50 -- and achieves an inference speed of 295 images per second, enabling deployment on Raspberry Pi and Jetson-class devices. Furthermore, when materials are regrouped into nine and five practical families, recall exceeds 98% and approaches 100%, directly supporting power and speed preset selection in laser cutters. These results demonstrate that compact, domain-specific CNNs can outperform large backbones for speckle-based material classification, advancing the feasibility of material-aware, edge-deployable laser cutting systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance EEG component classification accuracy and interpretability, aiming for scalable and expert-level neurophysiological analysis.

Method: The system uses GPT-4 Vision, a multimodal language model, to analyze EEG visualizations and provide classifications alongside human-like explanations.

Result: ICVision outperformed conventional classifiers with high agreement with experts (k = 0.677) and over 97% interpretability of outputs.

Conclusion: ICVision heralds a new era of AI in neurophysiology, redefining EEG workflows with explainable, scalable, and reproducible methods.

Abstract: We introduce EEG Autoclean Vision Language AI (ICVision) a first-of-its-kind system that emulates expert-level EEG ICA component classification through AI-agent vision and natural language reasoning. Unlike conventional classifiers such as ICLabel, which rely on handcrafted features, ICVision directly interprets ICA dashboard visualizations topography, time series, power spectra, and ERP plots, using a multimodal large language model (GPT-4 Vision). This allows the AI to see and explain EEG components the way trained neurologists do, making it the first scientific implementation of AI-agent visual cognition in neurophysiology. ICVision classifies each component into one of six canonical categories (brain, eye, heart, muscle, channel noise, and other noise), returning both a confidence score and a human-like explanation. Evaluated on 3,168 ICA components from 124 EEG datasets, ICVision achieved k = 0.677 agreement with expert consensus, surpassing MNE ICLabel, while also preserving clinically relevant brain signals in ambiguous cases. Over 97% of its outputs were rated as interpretable and actionable by expert reviewers. As a core module of the open-source EEG Autoclean platform, ICVision signals a paradigm shift in scientific AI, where models do not just classify, but see, reason, and communicate. It opens the door to globally scalable, explainable, and reproducible EEG workflows, marking the emergence of AI agents capable of expert-level visual decision-making in brain science and beyond.

Conclusion: The success of Mammo-FM underscores the potential of domain-specific foundation models for clinical tasks and demonstrates their importance for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. We introduce Mammo-FM, the first foundation model specifically for mammography, pretrained on the largest and most diverse dataset to date - 140,677 patients (821,326 mammograms) across four U.S. institutions. Mammo-FM provides a unified foundation for core clinical tasks in breast imaging, including cancer diagnosis, pathology localization, structured report generation, and cancer risk prognosis within a single framework. Its alignment between images and text enables both visual and textual interpretability, improving transparency and clinical auditability, which are essential for real-world adoption. We rigorously evaluate Mammo-FM across diagnosis, prognosis, and report-generation tasks in in- and out-of-distribution datasets. Despite operating on native-resolution mammograms and using only one-third of the parameters of state-of-the-art generalist FMs, Mammo-FM consistently outperforms them across multiple public and private benchmarks. These results highlight the efficiency and value of domain-specific foundation models designed around the full spectrum of tasks within a clinical domain and emphasize the importance of rigorous, domain-aligned evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D scene datasets lack rich semantic annotations, making them insufficient for nuanced visual-language tasks.

Method: DenseScan uses an automated pipeline combining multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models to generate dense captions and scenario-based questions.

Result: DenseScan enhances object-level understanding and improves question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: DenseScan introduces detailed annotations for 3D datasets, aiding advancements in robotics, AR, and visual-language tasks.

Abstract: 3D understanding is a key capability for real-world AI assistance. High-quality data plays an important role in driving the development of the 3D understanding community. Current 3D scene understanding datasets often provide geometric and instance-level information, yet they lack the rich semantic annotations necessary for nuanced visual-language tasks.In this work, we introduce DenseScan, a novel dataset with detailed multi-level descriptions generated by an automated pipeline leveraging multi-view 2D images and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach enables dense captioning of scene elements, ensuring comprehensive object-level descriptions that capture context-sensitive details. Furthermore, we extend these annotations through scenario-based question generation, producing high-level queries that integrate object properties, spatial relationships, and scene context. By coupling geometric detail with semantic richness, DenseScan broadens the range of downstream tasks, from detailed visual-language navigation to interactive question answering. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances object-level understanding and question-answering performance in 3D environments compared to traditional annotation pipelines. We release both the annotated dataset and our annotation pipeline to facilitate future research and applications in robotics, augmented reality, and beyond. Through DenseScan, we aim to catalyze new avenues in 3D scene understanding, allowing researchers and practitioners to tackle the complexities of real-world environments with richer, more contextually aware annotations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Relightable Holoported Characters (RHC) for rendering and relighting dynamic humans from sparse-view RGB videos, using a single network pass without the need for OLAT-basis capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of relighting highly dynamic humans efficiently and accurately from sparse-view RGB videos without relying on costly OLAT processes.

Method: The authors developed RelightNet, a transformer-based network trained on multi-view lightstage recordings with alternating illuminated sequences. It uses novel physics-informed features and texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats for rendering dynamic human characters under varied lighting conditions.

Result: The proposed RelightNet demonstrates superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RHC efficiently relights dynamic humans with high realism under diverse conditions, while bypassing traditional OLAT requirements, advancing the field of human rendering and relighting.

Abstract: We present Relightable Holoported Characters (RHC), a novel person-specific method for free-view rendering and relighting of full-body and highly dynamic humans solely observed from sparse-view RGB videos at inference. In contrast to classical one-light-at-a-time (OLAT)-based human relighting, our transformer-based RelightNet predicts relit appearance within a single network pass, avoiding costly OLAT-basis capture and generation. For training such a model, we introduce a new capture strategy and dataset recorded in a multi-view lightstage, where we alternate frames lit by random environment maps with uniformly lit tracking frames, simultaneously enabling accurate motion tracking and diverse illumination as well as dynamics coverage. Inspired by the rendering equation, we derive physics-informed features that encode geometry, albedo, shading, and the virtual camera view from a coarse human mesh proxy and the input views. Our RelightNet then takes these features as input and cross-attends them with a novel lighting condition, and regresses the relit appearance in the form of texel-aligned 3D Gaussian splats attached to the coarse mesh proxy. Consequently, our RelightNet implicitly learns to efficiently compute the rendering equation for novel lighting conditions within a single feed-forward pass. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior visual fidelity and lighting reproduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/RHC/

*Yuzhen Hu,Saurabh Prasad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses sparse annotations for multimodal remote sensing by proposing UniDiff, a diffusion model framework adapted to multiple modalities using only target-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse annotations in remote sensing limit the effectiveness and deployment of supervised methods, especially for heterogeneous modalities like hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

Method: UniDiff adapts a pre-trained ImageNet diffusion model to multimodal sensing data using techniques like FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation of 5% parameters, and pseudo-RGB anchoring.

Result: Experiments on two benchmarking datasets show that UniDiff mitigates annotation scarcity and effectively fuses multimodal remote sensing data through unsupervised adaptation.

Conclusion: UniDiff successfully adapts pre-trained models to diverse remote sensing tasks under sparse annotations, enhancing feature extraction and data fusion without requiring extensive labels.

Abstract: Sparse annotations fundamentally constrain multimodal remote sensing: even recent state-of-the-art supervised methods such as MSFMamba are limited by the availability of labeled data, restricting their practical deployment despite architectural advances. ImageNet-pretrained models provide rich visual representations, but adapting them to heterogeneous modalities such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) without large labeled datasets remains challenging. We propose UniDiff, a parameter-efficient framework that adapts a single ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model to multiple sensing modalities using only target-domain data. UniDiff combines FiLM-based timestep-modality conditioning, parameter-efficient adaptation of approximately 5% of parameters, and pseudo-RGB anchoring to preserve pre-trained representations and prevent catastrophic forgetting. This design enables effective feature extraction from remote sensing data under sparse annotations. Our results with two established multi-modal benchmarking datasets demonstrate that unsupervised adaptation of a pre-trained diffusion model effectively mitigates annotation constraints and achieves effective fusion of multi-modal remotely sensed data.

### [205] [HeartFormer: Semantic-Aware Dual-Structure Transformers for 3D Four-Chamber Cardiac Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00264)
*Zhengda Ma,Abhirup Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeartFormer, a novel transformer-based framework for 3D four-chamber cardiac reconstruction using cine MRI data and a newly created dataset, HeartCompv1, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the limitation of conventional cine MRI, which provides only 2D images, hindering a complete understanding of cardiac morphology and physiological mechanisms.

Method: They propose HeartFormer, a novel point cloud completion network based on a 2-component transformer architecture: SA-DSTNet, which creates an initial coarse geometry, and SA-GFRTNet, which refines it with semantic and geometric knowledge.

Result: HeartFormer shows robust, accurate, and generalizable 3D reconstructions by outperforming state-of-the-art models in cross-domain tests on HeartCompv1 and UK Biobank datasets.

Conclusion: HeartFormer provides a significant step in 3D cardiac reconstruction by delivering superior point-cloud-based performance, introducing a publicly available benchmark dataset (HeartCompv1), and setting new standards for future research.

Abstract: We present the first geometric deep learning framework based on point cloud representation for 3D four-chamber cardiac reconstruction from cine MRI data. This work addresses a long-standing limitation in conventional cine MRI, which typically provides only 2D slice images of the heart, thereby restricting a comprehensive understanding of cardiac morphology and physiological mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{HeartFormer}, a novel point cloud completion network that extends traditional single-class point cloud completion to the multi-class. HeartFormer consists of two key components: a Semantic-Aware Dual-Structure Transformer Network (SA-DSTNet) and a Semantic-Aware Geometry Feature Refinement Transformer Network (SA-GFRTNet). SA-DSTNet generates an initial coarse point cloud with both global geometry features and substructure geometry features. Guided by these semantic-geometry representations, SA-GFRTNet progressively refines the coarse output, effectively leveraging both global and substructure geometric priors to produce high-fidelity and geometrically consistent reconstructions. We further construct \textbf{HeartCompv1}, the first publicly available large-scale dataset with 17,000 high-resolution 3D multi-class cardiac meshes and point-clouds, to establish a general benchmark for this emerging research direction. Extensive cross-domain experiments on HeartCompv1 and UK Biobank demonstrate that HeartFormer achieves robust, accurate, and generalizable performance, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at: https://github.com/10Darren/HeartFormer.

*Jun Wang,Peirong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces USB, a framework for generating and editing both pathological and healthy brain images using a paired diffusion mechanism, overcoming limitations of data availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of obtaining paired pathological-healthy brain imaging data, which hinders advancements in neuroimaging analysis and applications such as disease diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: Develop USB, a unified framework leveraging a paired diffusion mechanism and a consistency guidance algorithm for generating and editing pathological-healthy brain images.

Result: Demonstrates diverse and realistic image generation on six public brain MRI datasets, showcasing bidirectional pathological-healthy image generation and editing capabilities.

Conclusion: USB offers a scalable and unified approach for brain image modeling, providing opportunities for better neuroimaging analysis, dataset creation, and research advancements.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between pathological and healthy brain structures is fundamental to neuroimaging, connecting disease diagnosis and detection with modeling, prediction, and treatment planning. However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery, named HIMOSA. Specifically, HIMOSA leverages the inherent redundancy in remote sensing imagery and introduces a content-aware sparse attention mechanism, enabling the model to achieve fast inference while maintaining strong reconstruction performance. Furthermore, to effectively leverage the multi-scale repetitive patterns found in remote sensing imagery, we introduce a hierarchical window expansion and reduce the computational complexity by adjusting the sparsity of the attention. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Lixing Guo,Tobias Höllerer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular AR system integrating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models for relational reasoning and spatial retrieval in physical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional AR systems, which rely on fixed detectors or markers and cannot process complex natural language queries.

Method: The system utilizes MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to construct dynamic AR scene graphs encoding diverse relations, enabling relational reasoning and accurate 3D anchor generation.

Result: The system supports complex query processing, spatial retrieval, human-in-the-loop refinement, and integration of plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining.

Conclusion: This modular architecture bridges AR and MLLMs, providing real-world spatial intelligence and enhancing interactive scene understanding with the introduction of the GroundedAR-Bench evaluation framework.

Abstract: Traditional augmented reality (AR) systems predominantly rely on fixed class detectors or fiducial markers, limiting their ability to interpret complex, open-vocabulary natural language queries. We present a modular AR agent system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with grounded vision models to enable relational reasoning in space and language-conditioned spatial retrieval in physical environments. Our adaptive task agent coordinates MLLMs and coordinate-aware perception tools to address varying query complexities, ranging from simple object identification to multi-object relational reasoning, while returning meter-accurate 3D anchors. It constructs dynamic AR scene graphs encoding nine typed relations (spatial, structural-semantic, causal-functional), enabling MLLMs to understand not just what objects exist, but how they relate and interact in 3D space. Through task-adaptive region-of-interest highlighting and contextual spatial retrieval, the system guides human attention to information-dense areas while supporting human-in-the-loop refinement. The agent dynamically invokes coordinate-aware tools for complex queries-selection, measurement, comparison, and actuation-grounding language understanding in physical operations. The modular architecture supports plug-and-use vision-language models without retraining, establishing AR agents as intermediaries that augment MLLMs with real-world spatial intelligence for interactive scene understanding. We also introduce GroundedAR-Bench, an evaluation framework for language-driven real world localization and relation grounding across diverse environments.

### [209] [TGSFormer: Scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting for Embodied Semantic Scene Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00300)
*Rui Qian,Haozhi Cao,Tianchen Deng,Tianxin Hu,Weixiang Guo,Shenghai Yuan,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGSFormer is a framework for scalable 3D semantic scene completion that reduces redundancy, scales well to large environments, and improves accuracy and efficiency using temporal Gaussian splatting and a compact fusion mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to 3D semantic scene completion face limitations such as redundancy, poor scalability in large scenes, and high latency/memory usage.

Method: TGSFormer integrates a persistent Gaussian memory system with dual temporal encoders for temporal fusion and a confidence-aware voxel fusion module to optimize geometry and semantics.

Result: TGSFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance on both local and embodied semantic scene completion benchmarks, with improved accuracy, scalability, and fewer primitives compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TGSFormer enhances both local and scalable semantic scene completion by handling temporal information more efficiently and maintaining compact representations, offering consistent long-term scene integrity.

Abstract: Embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) infers dense geometry and semantics from continuous egocentric observations. Most existing Gaussian-based methods rely on random initialization of many primitives within predefined spatial bounds, resulting in redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Recent depth-guided approach alleviates this issue but remains local, suffering from latency and memory overhead as scale increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose TGSFormer, a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied SSC. It maintains a persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction, without relying on image coherence or frame caches. For temporal fusion, a Dual Temporal Encoder jointly processes current and historical Gaussian features through confidence-aware cross-attention. Subsequently, a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module merges overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations, regulating density and maintaining compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity. The code will be released upon acceptance.

*Xiao Cui,Yulei Qin,Wengang Zhou,Hongsheng Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new approach for dataset distillation using Optimal Transport (OT) frameworks to improve generalization by preserving both global and instance-level distribution characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods fail to capture instance-level details and intra-class variations while focusing on global statistics, which hampers generalization in dataset distillation for large-scale datasets.

Method: The authors reformulated dataset distillation as an OT distance minimization problem and proposed three components: OT-guided diffusion sampling, label-image-aligned soft relabeling, and OT-based logit matching.

Result: Their method achieves consistent performance improvements, including a 4% accuracy improvement (under IPC=10 settings) on ImageNet-1K compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed OT-based framework effectively aligns geometric and feature distributions for distillation, showcasing robust performance and setting new benchmarks for large-scale dataset distillation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a compact distilled dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the full dataset. Recent methods for large-scale datasets focus on matching global distributional statistics (e.g., mean and variance), but overlook critical instance-level characteristics and intraclass variations, leading to suboptimal generalization. We address this limitation by reformulating dataset distillation as an Optimal Transport (OT) distance minimization problem, enabling fine-grained alignment at both global and instance levels throughout the pipeline. OT offers a geometrically faithful framework for distribution matching. It effectively preserves local modes, intra-class patterns, and fine-grained variations that characterize the geometry of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our method comprises three components tailored for preserving distributional geometry: (1) OT-guided diffusion sampling, which aligns latent distributions of real and distilled images; (2) label-image-aligned soft relabeling, which adapts label distributions based on the complexity of distilled image distributions; and (3) OT-based logit matching, which aligns the output of student models with soft-label distributions. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in an efficient manner, achieving at least 4% accuracy improvement under IPC=10 settings for each architecture on ImageNet-1K.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-ASyn generates anatomically consistent lung opacity anomalies for chest X-rays using realistic texture-based augmentations and enables zero-shot segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of unsupervised anomaly detection by creating realistic anomalies that respect anatomical consistency while providing explicit segmentation supervision.

Method: The paper introduces ART-ASyn, employing texture-based augmentation and Progressive Binary Thresholding Segmentation (PBTSeg) for generating synthetic anomalies and masks for lung segmentation.

Result: ART-ASyn enhances the realism of generated anomalies, facilitates supervised segmentation, and demonstrates generalizability by enabling zero-shot anomaly segmentation on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: ART-ASyn provides a promising approach for anomaly detection in medical imaging, improving segmentation performance and zero-shot abilities in diverse datasets.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies without pixel-level annotations. Synthetic anomaly-based methods exhibit a unique capacity to introduce controllable irregularities with known masks, enabling explicit supervision during training. However, existing methods often produce synthetic anomalies that are visually distinct from real pathological patterns and ignore anatomical structure. This paper presents a novel Anatomy-aware Realistic Texture-based Anomaly Synthesis framework (ART-ASyn) for chest X-rays that generates realistic and anatomically consistent lung opacity related anomalies using texture-based augmentation guided by our proposed Progressive Binary Thresholding Segmentation method (PBTSeg) for lung segmentation. The generated paired samples of synthetic anomalies and their corresponding precise pixel-level anomaly mask for each normal sample enable explicit segmentation supervision. In contrast to prior work limited to one-class classification, ART-ASyn is further evaluated for zero-shot anomaly segmentation, demonstrating generalizability on an unseen dataset without target-domain annotations.

*Chenqi Zhu,Levi Burner,Yiannis Aloimonos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel visual odometry technique using ruled surfaces observed in image-space time, minimizing reliance on traditional point-to-point correspondence methods and incorporating IMU sensor data for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the limitations of traditional visual odometry methods, such as computation cost and accuracy issues caused by reliance on point-to-point correspondence.

Method: The research uses a novel algorithm that analyzes ruled surfaces formed by camera-observed lines sweeping in image-space. The process integrates IMU sensor data to improve dimensionality reduction and scene reconstruction.

Result: The proposed method enables accurate 3D scene reconstruction and visual odometry, leveraging the benefits of edge detection from event cameras and constrained by inertia data.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust alternative to traditional visual odometry techniques by reducing reliance on correspondence calculations and combining innovative surface analyses with IMU data.

Abstract: Visual odometry techniques typically rely on feature extraction from a sequence of images and subsequent computation of optical flow. This point-to-point correspondence between two consecutive frames can be costly to compute and suffers from varying accuracy, which affects the odometry estimate's quality. Attempts have been made to bypass the difficulties originating from the correspondence problem by adopting line features and fusing other sensors (event camera, IMU) to improve performance, many of which still heavily rely on correspondence. If the camera observes a straight line as it moves, the image of the line sweeps a smooth surface in image-space time. It is a ruled surface and analyzing its shape gives information about odometry. Further, its estimation requires only differentially computed updates from point-to-line associations. Inspired by event cameras' propensity for edge detection, this research presents a novel algorithm to reconstruct 3D scenes and visual odometry from these ruled surfaces. By constraining the surfaces with the inertia measurements from an onboard IMU sensor, the dimensionality of the solution space is greatly reduced.

TL;DR: The paper presents MVAD, a comprehensive dataset for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content, addressing the gaps in existing synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive multimodal datasets that encompass both video and audio modalities, particularly for trustworthy detection systems.

Method: Developed the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD) featuring realistic forgery patterns, high-quality generative models, and diverse multimodal content.

Result: Introduced the first benchmark dataset combining realistic video-audio data with high perceptual and structural diversity.

Conclusion: MVAD bridges the gap in existing datasets, paving the way for the development of advanced detection systems for AI-generated content.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated multimodal video-audio content has raised significant concerns regarding information security and content authenticity. Existing synthetic video datasets predominantly focus on the visual modality alone, while the few incorporating audio are largely confined to facial deepfakes--a limitation that fails to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and substantially impedes the development of trustworthy detection systems. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content. Our dataset exhibits three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality achieved through diverse state-of-the-art generative models; and (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic and anime visual styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, and scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types.

*Zhongqi Wang,Jie Zhang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AMDET, a novel model-level detection framework to identify backdoors in vision-language pretrained models (VLPs) without requiring prior knowledge of the dataset, triggers, or classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language pretrained models like CLIP are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet detecting these backdoors remains challenging due to reliance on prior knowledge, making existing methods impractical for real-world applications.

Method: The paper presents AMDET, leveraging the feature assimilation property in backdoored text encoders. It identifies similarities in token representations within backdoor samples, pointing to concentrated attention weights on trigger tokens. Gradient-based inversion on token embeddings recovers hidden backdoor features, followed by loss landscape analysis to filter natural backdoor-like behaviors.

Result: AMDET effectively detects backdoors in VLP models with an F1 score of 89.90% across various experiments involving 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models. Its detection is efficient, completing in about 5 minutes on an RTX 4090 GPU, and robust against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed AMDET framework successfully and efficiently detects backdoors in VLP models without prior knowledge while demonstrating robustness in diverse scenarios, offering a practical solution to a critical security challenge.

Abstract: Vision-language pretrained models (VLPs) such as CLIP have achieved remarkable success, but are also highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Given a model fine-tuned by an untrusted third party, determining whether the model has been injected with a backdoor is a critical and challenging problem. Existing detection methods usually rely on prior knowledge of training dataset, backdoor triggers and targets, or downstream classifiers, which may be impractical for real-world applications. To address this, To address this challenge, we introduce Assimilation Matters in DETection (AMDET), a novel model-level detection framework that operates without any such prior knowledge. Specifically, we first reveal the feature assimilation property in backdoored text encoders: the representations of all tokens within a backdoor sample exhibit a high similarity. Further analysis attributes this effect to the concentration of attention weights on the trigger token. Leveraging this insight, AMDET scans a model by performing gradient-based inversion on token embeddings to recover implicit features that capable of activating backdoor behaviors. Furthermore, we identify the natural backdoor feature in the OpenAI's official CLIP model, which are not intentionally injected but still exhibit backdoor-like behaviors. We then filter them out from real injected backdoor by analyzing their loss landscapes. Extensive experiments on 3,600 backdoored and benign-finetuned models with two attack paradigms and three VLP model structures show that AMDET detects backdoors with an F1 score of 89.90%. Besides, it achieves one complete detection in approximately 5 minutes on a RTX 4090 GPU and exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces mmWave radar for Human Motion Prediction (HMP) to overcome the limitations of RGB-D cameras and proposes mmPred, a diffusion-based framework for noise mitigation and improving temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-D camera-based HMP methods are limited by sensitivity to lighting conditions and privacy issues, particularly in applications like firefighting and healthcare. mmWave radar is proposed for its robustness and privacy-preservation.

Method: The paper develops mmPred, a diffusion-based framework with a dual-domain approach: a Time-domain Pose Refinement branch and a Frequency-domain Dominant Motion branch, alongside a Global Skeleton-relational Transformer for joint cooperation.

Result: mmPred significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 8.6% improvement on mmBody and 22% on mm-Fi datasets.

Conclusion: Radar-based HMP through mmPred addresses noise and inconsistency effectively, providing a more reliable and privacy-preserving solution compared to RGB-D cameras.

Abstract: Existing Human Motion Prediction (HMP) methods based on RGB-D cameras are sensitive to lighting conditions and raise privacy concerns, limiting their real-world applications such as firefighting and healthcare. Motivated by the robustness and privacy-preserving nature of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, this work introduces radar as a novel sensing modality for HMP, for the first time. Nevertheless, radar signals often suffer from specular reflections and multipath effects, resulting in noisy and temporally inconsistent measurements, such as body-part miss-detection. To address these radar-specific artifacts, we propose mmPred, the first diffusion-based framework tailored for radar-based HMP. mmPred introduces a dual-domain historical motion representation to guide the generation process, combining a Time-domain Pose Refinement (TPR) branch for learning fine-grained details and a Frequency-domain Dominant Motion (FDM) branch for capturing global motion trends and suppressing frame-level inconsistency. Furthermore, we design a Global Skeleton-relational Transformer (GST) as the diffusion backbone to model global inter-joint cooperation, enabling corrupted joints to dynamically aggregate information from others. Extensive experiments show that mmPred achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 8.6% on mmBody and 22% on mm-Fi.

TL;DR: The paper presents SMamDiff, a single-stage spatial-temporal diffusion model for human motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced latency and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human motion prediction often compromise between uncertainty and kinematic plausibility, and multi-stage pipelines are computationally expensive for edge deployment.

Method: The proposed solution is SMamDiff, a model incorporating residual-DCT motion encoding for better temporal signal representation and a spatial-mamba module for enhanced joint dependency and spatial coherence.

Result: On Human3.6M and HumanEva datasets, SMamDiff achieves superior performance in single-stage probabilistic human motion prediction while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SMamDiff effectively balances spatial-temporal coherence and computational efficiency in human motion prediction, advancing edge-deployable models without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: With intelligent room-side sensing and service robots widely deployed, human motion prediction (HMP) is essential for safe, proactive assistance. However, many existing HMP methods either produce a single, deterministic forecast that ignores uncertainty or rely on probabilistic models that sacrifice kinematic plausibility. Diffusion models improve the accuracy-diversity trade-off but often depend on multi-stage pipelines that are costly for edge deployment. This work focuses on how to ensure spatial-temporal coherence within a single-stage diffusion model for HMP. We introduce SMamDiff, a Spatial Mamba-based Diffusion model with two novel designs: (i) a residual-DCT motion encoding that subtracts the last observed pose before a temporal DCT, reducing the first DC component ($f=0$) dominance and highlighting informative higher-frequency cues so the model learns how joints move rather than where they are; and (ii) a stickman-drawing spatial-mamba module that processes joints in an ordered, joint-by-joint manner, making later joints condition on earlier ones to induce long-range, cross-joint dependencies. On Human3.6M and HumanEva, these coherence mechanisms deliver state-of-the-art results among single-stage probabilistic HMP methods while using less latency and memory than multi-stage diffusion baselines.

*Jianhong Han,Yupei Wang,Yuan Zhang,Liang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MM-DETR, a lightweight and efficient framework for multimodal object detection, improving accuracy and practicality over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal object detection approaches are limited by fusion complexity, suboptimal feature extraction from shared backbones, and high parameter counts in dual-stream designs.

Method: MM-DETR introduces a dual granularity fusion encoder with efficient cross-modal modeling, regional modality completion for fine-grained fusion, and a lightweight frequency-aware adapter to optimize modality-specific feature extraction.

Result: Experiments across four multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate MM-DETR's effectiveness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MM-DETR addresses the shortcomings of existing methods, achieving efficient multimodal fusion while reducing computational overhead, and enabling practical deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal remote sensing object detection aims to achieve more accurate and robust perception under challenging conditions by fusing complementary information from different modalities. However, existing approaches that rely on attention-based or deformable convolution fusion blocks still struggle to balance performance and lightweight design. Beyond fusion complexity, extracting modality features with shared backbones yields suboptimal representations due to insufficient modality-specific modeling, whereas dual-stream architectures nearly double the parameter count, ultimately limiting practical deployment. To this end, we propose MM-DETR, a lightweight and efficient framework for multimodal object detection. Specifically, we propose a Mamba-based dual granularity fusion encoder that reformulates global interaction as channel-wise dynamic gating and leverages a 1D selective scan for efficient cross-modal modeling with linear complexity. Following this design, we further reinterpret multimodal fusion as a modality completion problem. A region-aware 2D selective scanning completion branch is introduced to recover modality-specific cues, supporting fine-grained fusion along a bidirectional pyramid pathway with minimal overhead. To further reduce parameter redundancy while retaining strong feature extraction capability, a lightweight frequency-aware modality adapter is inserted into the shared backbone. This adapter employs a spatial-frequency co-expert structure to capture modality-specific cues, while a pixel-wise router dynamically balances expert contributions for efficient spatial-frequency fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on four multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed method.

TL;DR: This paper explores the development of coarse, body-like representations in semantic segmentation models, comparing them to human physical reasoning and demonstrates how limited computational resources affect representational granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand if machine vision models naturally develop coarse internal representations similar to humans, which capture intuitive motion and physical reasoning.

Method: They adapted a psychophysical experiment conducted with human participants into a semantic segmentation task, testing the performance and representations of seven different segmentation networks varying in size.

Result: Smaller models formed human-like coarse representations, while larger ones developed detailed and fine-grained encodings.

Conclusion: Coarse physical representations naturally emerge in systems constrained by limited resources, suggesting machine models can aid in understanding human physical reasoning.

Abstract: Human physical reasoning relies on internal "body" representations - coarse, volumetric approximations that capture an object's extent and support intuitive predictions about motion and physics. While psychophysical evidence suggests humans use such coarse representations, their internal structure remains largely unknown. Here we test whether vision models trained for segmentation develop comparable representations. We adapt a psychophysical experiment conducted with 50 human participants to a semantic segmentation task and test a family of seven segmentation networks, varying in size. We find that smaller models naturally form human-like coarse body representations, whereas larger models tend toward overly detailed, fine-grain encodings. Our results demonstrate that coarse representations can emerge under limited computational resources, and that machine representations can provide a scalable path toward understanding the structure of physical reasoning in the brain.

### [219] [THCRL: Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00368)
*Jian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method called Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning (THCRL) to address untrustworthy fusion in multi-view clustering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Untrustworthy fusion in multi-view clustering arises due to the presence of noise in individual views and existing contrastive learning methods neglecting structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster.

Method: The method involves two modules: (1) Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) to achieve trustworthy multi-view data fusion using the UNet architecture with denoising mechanisms, and (2) Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) to align fused and view-specific representations by focusing on similarities within the same cluster.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed THCRL method achieves state-of-the-art performance in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Conclusion: The THCRL approach effectively overcomes the limitations of untrustworthy fusion in MVC by incorporating denoising mechanisms and cluster-level contrastive learning techniques.

Abstract: Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has garnered increasing attention in recent years. It is capable of partitioning data samples into distinct groups by learning a consensus representation. However, a significant challenge remains: the problem of untrustworthy fusion. This problem primarily arises from two key factors: 1) Existing methods often ignore the presence of inherent noise within individual views; 2) In traditional MVC methods using Contrastive Learning (CL), similarity computations typically rely on different views of the same instance, while neglecting the structural information from nearest neighbors within the same cluster. Consequently, this leads to the wrong direction for multi-view fusion. To address this problem, we present a novel Trusted Hierarchical Contrastive Representation Learning (THCRL). It consists of two key modules. Specifically, we propose the Deep Symmetry Hierarchical Fusion (DSHF) module, which leverages the UNet architecture integrated with multiple denoising mechanisms to achieve trustworthy fusion of multi-view data. Furthermore, we present the Average K-Nearest Neighbors Contrastive Learning (AKCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. Unlike conventional strategies, AKCL enhances representation similarity among samples belonging to the same cluster, rather than merely focusing on the same sample across views, thereby reinforcing the confidence of the fused representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THCRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance in deep MVC tasks.

### [220] [POLARIS: Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00369)
*Wenshuo Chen,Haosen Li,Shaofeng Liang,Lei Wang,Haozhe Jia,Kaishen Yuan,Jieming Wu,Bowen Tian,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes POLARIS, a method to address the issue of noise approximation errors in the Inversion-Denoising Paradigm, greatly improving image restoration and editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods for image editing and restoration face significant reconstruction degradation due to noise approximation errors during inversion.

Method: POLARIS reformulates inversion from an error-compensation problem to addressing the root cause of error by treating the guidance scale ω as a step-wise variable and minimizing inversion error through a derived mathematical formula.

Result: POLARIS mitigates noise approximation errors, improves latent quality, requires minimal code changes, and has negligible performance overhead while enhancing accuracy in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: POLARIS introduces an adaptive and mathematically-grounded approach to solve noise approximation issues in image reconstruction, ensuring consistent improvement with minimal implementation complexity.

Abstract: The Inversion-Denoising Paradigm, which is based on diffusion models, excels in diverse image editing and restoration tasks. We revisit its mechanism and reveal a critical, overlooked factor in reconstruction degradation: the approximate noise error. This error stems from approximating the noise at step t with the prediction at step t-1, resulting in severe error accumulation throughout the inversion process. We introduce Projection-Orthogonal Least Squares for Robust and Adaptive Inversion (POLARIS), which reformulates inversion from an error-compensation problem into an error-origin problem. Rather than optimizing embeddings or latent codes to offset accumulated drift, POLARIS treats the guidance scale ω as a step-wise variable and derives a mathematically grounded formula to minimize inversion error at each step. Remarkably, POLARIS improves inversion latent quality with just one line of code. With negligible performance overhead, it substantially mitigates noise approximation errors and consistently improves the accuracy of downstream tasks.

*Dong Li,HuaLiang Lin,JiaYu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PorePatch dataset and a Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to improve the performance of local descriptors in facial weak-texture regions but highlights the ongoing challenges of such descriptors for 3D reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial skin regions with weak textures are challenging for descriptor matching in applications like motion analysis and 3D reconstruction. Existing deep learning descriptors underperform due to a lack of high-quality, pore-scale image datasets.

Method: The authors present the PorePatch dataset and the DMCE framework to generate a high-quality dataset. They trained SOTA models on this dataset, performed extensive experiments, and compared deep learning and traditional descriptors.

Result: The SOTA model trained on PorePatch achieved an FPR95 of 1.91% in matching tasks, outperforming traditional descriptors like PSIFT. However, its performance in 3D reconstruction tasks showed limited improvement over traditional methods.

Conclusion: Despite advances with the PorePatch dataset and DMCE framework, deep learning descriptors face significant challenges in facial weak-texture applications, particularly in 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: The weak-texture nature of facial skin regions presents significant challenges for local descriptor matching in applications such as facial motion analysis and 3D face reconstruction. Although deep learning-based descriptors have demonstrated superior performance to traditional hand-crafted descriptors in many applications, the scarcity of pore-scale image patch datasets has hindered their further development in the facial domain. In this paper, we propose the PorePatch dataset, a high-quality pore-scale image patch dataset, and establish a rational evaluation benchmark. We introduce a Data-Model Co-Evolution (DMCE) framework to generate a progressively refined, high-quality dataset from high-resolution facial images. We then train existing SOTA models on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments. Our results show that the SOTA model achieves a FPR95 value of 1.91% on the matching task, outperforming PSIFT (22.41%) by a margin of 20.5%. However, its advantage is diminished in the 3D reconstruction task, where its overall performance is not significantly better than that of traditional descriptors. This indicates that deep learning descriptors still have limitations in addressing the challenges of facial weak-texture regions, and much work remains to be done in this field.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EZ-SP, a GPU-based superpoint partitioning algorithm that enhances 3D semantic segmentation efficiency, operating 13x faster than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current superpoint-based pipelines face bottlenecks due to CPU-dependent partitioning, limiting their speed and scalability for 3D semantic segmentation.

Method: The paper proposes a learnable, GPU-accelerated partition algorithm that generates coherent superpoints using a compact model (under 60k parameters) and a differentiable surrogate loss without handcrafted features.

Result: EZ-SP achieves a 72x faster inference time and 120x fewer parameters compared to point-based state-of-the-art models while maintaining comparable accuracy across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: EZ-SP provides a highly efficient and scalable solution for 3D semantic segmentation, facilitating real-time inference with minimal resource demands.

Abstract: Superpoint-based pipelines provide an efficient alternative to point- or voxel-based 3D semantic segmentation, but are often bottlenecked by their CPU-bound partition step. We propose a learnable, fully GPU partitioning algorithm that generates geometrically and semantically coherent superpoints 13$\times$ faster than prior methods. Our module is compact (under 60k parameters), trains in under 20 minutes with a differentiable surrogate loss, and requires no handcrafted features. Combine with a lightweight superpoint classifier, the full pipeline fits in $<$2 MB of VRAM, scales to multi-million-point scenes, and supports real-time inference. With 72$\times$ faster inference and 120$\times$ fewer parameters, EZ-SP matches the accuracy of point-based SOTA models across three domains: indoor scans (S3DIS), autonomous driving (KITTI-360), and aerial LiDAR (DALES).

TL;DR: WiseEdit introduces a novel benchmark for evaluating advanced image editing models on cognition- and creativity-informed tasks, focusing on three distinct steps: Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, using knowledge-based criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate the cognitive and creative capabilities of advanced image editing models. WiseEdit aims to address this gap.

Method: WiseEdit uses an analogy to human cognitive creation to break down image editing into three steps (Awareness, Interpretation, Imagination) and incorporates three knowledge types (Declarative, Procedural, Metacognitive) in its benchmark for evaluation of models.

Result: WiseEdit reveals the limitations of state-of-the-art image editing models in cognitive reasoning and creative composition through 1,220 test cases across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: WiseEdit provides a unique framework for evaluating the cognitive and creative abilities of image editing models, pushing the field toward more sophisticated benchmarks and standards.

Abstract: Recent image editing models boast next-level intelligent capabilities, facilitating cognition- and creativity-informed image editing. Yet, existing benchmarks provide too narrow a scope for evaluation, failing to holistically assess these advanced abilities. To address this, we introduce WiseEdit, a knowledge-intensive benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of cognition- and creativity-informed image editing, featuring deep task depth and broad knowledge breadth. Drawing an analogy to human cognitive creation, WiseEdit decomposes image editing into three cascaded steps, i.e., Awareness, Interpretation, and Imagination, each corresponding to a task that poses a challenge for models to complete at the specific step. It also encompasses complex tasks, where none of the three steps can be finished easily. Furthermore, WiseEdit incorporates three fundamental types of knowledge: Declarative, Procedural, and Metacognitive knowledge. Ultimately, WiseEdit comprises 1,220 test cases, objectively revealing the limitations of SoTA image editing models in knowledge-based cognitive reasoning and creative composition capabilities. The benchmark, evaluation code, and the generated images of each model will be made publicly available soon. Project Page: https://qnancy.github.io/wiseedit_project_page/.

*Jiazhen Liu,Mingkuan Feng,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAMP, a multimodal large language model that solves the trilemma of preserving dialogue ability, achieving strong segmentation, and ensuring fast inference using a novel all-mask prediction paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent challenges of integrating segmentation into MLLMs without compromising on dialogue quality, segmentation effectiveness, or inference speed.

Method: Developed a novel all-mask prediction approach, decoupling dialogue generation and segmentation by employing non-autoregressive mask prediction. This mechanism treats segmentation as a parallel task over image patches after textual dialogue response generation.

Result: STAMP achieves high segmentation performance, maintains robust dialogue capabilities, and operates at exceptional speeds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: STAMP provides an effective solution to the MLLM trilemma, achieving balanced performance in dialogue, segmentation, and speed, demonstrating its superiority over traditional methods.

Abstract: Integrating segmentation into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents a core trilemma: simultaneously preserving dialogue ability, achieving high segmentation performance, and ensuring fast inference. Prevailing paradigms are forced into a compromise. Embedding prediction methods introduce a conflicting pixel-level objective that degrades the MLLM's general dialogue abilities. The alternative, next-token prediction, reframes segmentation as an autoregressive task, which preserves dialogue but forces a trade-off between poor segmentation performance with sparse outputs or prohibitive inference speeds with rich ones. We resolve this trilemma with all-mask prediction, a novel paradigm that decouples autoregressive dialogue generation from non-autoregressive mask prediction. We present STAMP: Simultaneous Textual All-Mask Prediction, an MLLM that embodies this paradigm. After generating a textual response, STAMP predicts an entire segmentation mask in a single forward pass by treating it as a parallel "fill-in-the-blank" task over image patches. This design maintains the MLLM's dialogue ability by avoiding conflicting objectives, enables high segmentation performance by leveraging rich, bidirectional spatial context for all mask tokens, and achieves exceptional speed. Extensive experiments show that STAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple segmentation benchmarks, providing a solution that excels in dialogue, segmentation, and speed without compromise.

*Lingdong Wang,Guan-Ming Su,Divya Kothandaraman,Tsung-Wei Huang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Ramesh K. Sitaraman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiSCo, a semantic video compression framework leveraging generative priors to transmit meaningful information for high-quality video synthesis at ultra-low bitrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video codecs focus on pixel fidelity, which fails to align with human perception at ultra-low bitrates, resulting in severe artifacts. A new approach is needed to balance compression and perceptual quality.

Method: The method involves decomposing video into textual descriptions, degraded video, and optional sketches/poses. A conditional video diffusion model generates coherent videos from these representations with proposed enhancements like temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs.

Result: DiSCo achieves a 2-10X improvement in perceptual metrics compared to traditional and baseline semantic codecs at low bitrates.

Conclusion: DiSCo demonstrates that prioritizing perceptually meaningful information and utilizing generative priors can significantly enhance video compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.

Abstract: Traditional video codecs optimized for pixel fidelity collapse at ultra-low bitrates and produce severe artifacts. This failure arises from a fundamental misalignment between pixel accuracy and human perception. We propose a semantic video compression framework named DiSCo that transmits only the most meaningful information while relying on generative priors for detail synthesis. The source video is decomposed into three compact modalities: a textual description, a spatiotemporally degraded video, and optional sketches or poses that respectively capture semantic, appearance, and motion cues. A conditional video diffusion model then reconstructs high-quality, temporally coherent videos from these compact representations. Temporal forward filling, token interleaving, and modality-specific codecs are proposed to improve multimodal generation and modality compactness. Experiments show that our method outperforms baseline semantic and traditional codecs by 2-10X on perceptual metrics at low bitrates.

TL;DR: The paper presents SplatFont3D, a novel framework for generating 3D artistic fonts with precise part-level style control using 3D Gaussian splatting and a score distillation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in 3D artistic font generation, which is essential for immersive 3D environments and improving 2D font rendering while enabling fine-grained style control for 3D fonts.

Method: Proposes SplatFont3D, which includes a Glyph2Cloud module for transforming 2D glyphs into 3D Gaussian point clouds, and utilizes a pretrained 2D diffusion model with score distillation sampling for style optimization and part-level control.

Result: SplatFont3D surpasses existing 3D font generation methods in text-style consistency, visual quality, and rendering speed.

Conclusion: SplatFont3D effectively addresses the challenges of 3D artistic font generation with enhanced part-level control and visual fidelity, offering practical applications in 3D environments and improving upon prior methods.

Abstract: Artistic font generation (AFG) can assist human designers in creating innovative artistic fonts. However, most previous studies primarily focus on 2D artistic fonts in flat design, leaving personalized 3D-AFG largely underexplored. 3D-AFG not only enables applications in immersive 3D environments such as video games and animations, but also may enhance 2D-AFG by rendering 2D fonts of novel views. Moreover, unlike general 3D objects, 3D fonts exhibit precise semantics with strong structural constraints and also demand fine-grained part-level style control. To address these challenges, we propose SplatFont3D, a novel structure-aware text-to-3D AFG framework with 3D Gaussian splatting, which enables the creation of 3D artistic fonts from diverse style text prompts with precise part-level style control. Specifically, we first introduce a Glyph2Cloud module, which progressively enhances both the shapes and styles of 2D glyphs (or components) and produces their corresponding 3D point clouds for Gaussian initialization. The initialized 3D Gaussians are further optimized through interaction with a pretrained 2D diffusion model using score distillation sampling. To enable part-level control, we present a dynamic component assignment strategy that exploits the geometric priors of 3D Gaussians to partition components, while alleviating drift-induced entanglement during 3D Gaussian optimization. Our SplatFont3D provides more explicit and effective part-level style control than NeRF, attaining faster rendering efficiency. Experiments show that our SplatFont3D outperforms existing 3D models for 3D-AFG in style-text consistency, visual quality, and rendering efficiency.

### [227] [PhysGen: Physically Grounded 3D Shape Generation for Industrial Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00422)
*Yingxuan You,Chen Zhao,Hantao Zhang,Mingda Xu,Pascal Fua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a physics-based 3D shape generation method to improve the realism of engineered shapes by incorporating physical properties into the generative process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional 3D generative models lack awareness of physical properties which are crucial for the realism of engineering-focused shape designs, such as aerodynamic performance.

Method: The paper introduces a physics-guided 3D shape generation pipeline using a flow matching model with alternating updates: velocity-based adjustments and physics-based refinements. A shape-and-physics variational autoencoder (SP-VAE) encodes shape and physics information in a unified latent space, with physics-aware regularization enhancing the model.

Result: The experiments show that the proposed approach improves shape realism, incorporating both visual and physical plausibility, and performs effectively across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method successfully integrates physical properties into 3D shape generative processes, enhancing the realism and applicability of designs, especially for industrial engineering use cases.

Abstract: Existing generative models for 3D shapes can synthesize high-fidelity and visually plausible shapes. For certain classes of shapes that have undergone an engineering design process, the realism of the shape is tightly coupled with the underlying physical properties, e.g., aerodynamic efficiency for automobiles. Since existing methods lack knowledge of such physics, they are unable to use this knowledge to enhance the realism of shape generation. Motivated by this, we propose a unified physics-based 3D shape generation pipeline, with a focus on industrial design applications. Specifically, we introduce a new flow matching model with explicit physical guidance, consisting of an alternating update process. We iteratively perform a velocity-based update and a physics-based refinement, progressively adjusting the latent code to align with the desired 3D shapes and physical properties. We further strengthen physical validity by incorporating a physics-aware regularization term into the velocity-based update step. To support such physics-guided updates, we build a shape-and-physics variational autoencoder (SP-VAE) that jointly encodes shape and physics information into a unified latent space. The experiments on three benchmarks show that this synergistic formulation improves shape realism beyond mere visual plausibility.

*Nthenya Kyatha,Jay Taneja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study developed a method leveraging onboard CCTV to analyze bus origin-destination flows in sub-Saharan Africa, achieving high accuracy under ideal conditions but struggling in real-world stressors like overcrowding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable passenger flow data in sub-Saharan Africa's overcrowded public transport systems where automated systems fail.

Method: Combined YOLOv1 detection, BotSORT tracking, OSNet embeddings, OCR timestamping, and telematics stop classification to recover bus origin-destination flows using onboard CCTV.

Result: Achieved around 93% F1 score under low-density, well-lit conditions, but accuracy dropped significantly under real-world stressors such as overcrowding and monochrome footage.

Conclusion: While the pipeline performs well under controlled conditions, it highlights the need for robust methods tailored to the challenges of sub-Saharan African transit environments.

Abstract: Public transport in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often operates in overcrowded conditions where existing automated systems fail to capture reliable passenger flow data. Leveraging onboard CCTV already deployed for security, we present a baseline pipeline that combines YOLOv12 detection, BotSORT tracking, OSNet embeddings, OCR-based timestamping, and telematics-based stop classification to recover bus origin--destination (OD) flows. On annotated CCTV segments from Nairobi and Kigali buses, the system attains high counting accuracy under low-density, well-lit conditions (recall $\approx$95\%, precision $\approx$91\%, F1 $\approx$93\%). It produces OD matrices that closely match manual tallies. Under realistic stressors such as overcrowding, color-to-monochrome shifts, posture variation, and non-standard door use, performance degrades sharply (e.g., $\sim$40\% undercount in peak-hour boarding and a $\sim$17 percentage-point drop in recall for monochrome segments), revealing deployment-specific failure modes and motivating more robust, deployment-focused Re-ID methods for SSA transit.

*Minh-Quan Le,Yuanzhi Zhu,Vicky Kalogeiton,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$, a post-training framework for video generation that improves physical realism by incorporating Newtonian physics using verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent video diffusion models, while visually compelling, often lack physical realism, violating basic laws of physics like consistent motion and collisions.

Method: The authors propose $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$, which uses measurable proxies such as optical flow (velocity) and appearance features (mass) to enforce Newtonian constraints. Two rewards are used: a kinematic constraint for acceleration dynamics and a mass conservation reward. This framework is tested on a newly built benchmark, $\texttt{NewtonBench-60K}$.

Result: $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence across various motion primitives and under out-of-distribution conditions such as varying speed and friction.

Conclusion: The introduction of physics-grounded verifiable rewards provides a scalable method for enhancing physical realism in video generation models.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet often violate basic physical laws-objects float, accelerations drift, and collisions behave inconsistently-revealing a persistent gap between visual realism and physical realism. We propose $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$, the first physics-grounded post-training framework for video generation based on $\textit{verifiable rewards}$. Instead of relying on human or VLM feedback, $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ extracts $\textit{measurable proxies}$ from generated videos using frozen utility models: optical flow serves as a proxy for velocity, while high-level appearance features serve as a proxy for mass. These proxies enable explicit enforcement of Newtonian structure through two complementary rewards: a Newtonian kinematic constraint enforcing constant-acceleration dynamics, and a mass conservation reward preventing trivial, degenerate solutions. We evaluate $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ on five Newtonian Motion Primitives (free fall, horizontal/parabolic throw, and ramp sliding down/up) using our newly constructed large-scale benchmark, $\texttt{NewtonBench-60K}$. Across all primitives in visual and physics metrics, $\texttt{NewtonRewards}$ consistently improves physical plausibility, motion smoothness, and temporal coherence over prior post-training methods. It further maintains strong performance under out-of-distribution shifts in height, speed, and friction. Our results show that physics-grounded verifiable rewards offer a scalable path toward physics-aware video generation.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of synthetic chest X-ray images generated by an AI model, Nano Banana, to train a pneumonia classification model, demonstrating promising performance on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the feasibility of using synthetic medical images for developing AI classifiers to overcome data availability challenges in healthcare.

Method: Synthetic chest X-ray images were generated using Nano Banana, and a classifier was trained exclusively on this synthetic data. External validations were conducted on real-world datasets to evaluate its performance.

Result: The classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.923 and an AUPR of 0.900 on one dataset, and an AUROC of 0.824 and an AUPR of 0.913 on another, showing promising results.

Conclusion: While synthetic data shows potential for medical AI development, current limitations such as diversity control and post-processing need addressing, alongside stringent validation, regulatory approval, and ethical considerations for clinical application.

Abstract: We trained a classifier with synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images generated by Nano Banana, the latest AI model for image generation and editing, released by Google. When directly applied to real-world CXRs having only been trained with synthetic data, the classifier achieved an AUROC of 0.923 (95% CI: 0.919 - 0.927), and an AUPR of 0.900 (95% CI: 0.894 - 0.907) in recognizing pneumonia in the 2018 RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset (14,863 CXRs), and an AUROC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.810 - 0.836), and an AUPR of 0.913 (95% CI: 0.904 - 0.922) in the Chest X-Ray dataset (5,856 CXRs). These external validation results on real-world data demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and suggest potential for synthetic data in medical AI development. Nonetheless, several limitations remain at present, including challenges in prompt design for controlling the diversity of synthetic CXR data and the requirement for post-processing to ensure alignment with real-world data. However, the growing sophistication and accessibility of medical intelligence will necessitate substantial validation, regulatory approval, and ethical oversight prior to clinical translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FR-TTS, a method designed to apply test-time scaling to next-token prediction (NTP) by solving limitations in evaluating intermediate samples. Its novel Filling-Based Reward (FR) estimates future trajectories to improve evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While test-time scaling excels in image generation, it struggles with next-token prediction tasks due to poor correlation between intermediate and final sequence rewards. A method was needed to better evaluate and guide incomplete intermediate samples.

Method: The novel Filling-Based Reward (FR) estimates the future trajectory of intermediate token sequences by applying filling schemes. It improves correlation metrics and incorporates a dynamic diversity reward within FR-TTS scaling strategy.

Result: FR-TTS outperforms existing benchmarks and reward models in experiments, showcasing superior evaluation and sample generation performance.

Conclusion: FR-TTS demonstrates the feasibility of test-time scaling for NTP by addressing issues in intermediate sample evaluation through a novel reward mechanism, promising improved performance for sequence-based tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has become a prevalent technique in image generation, significantly boosting output quality by expanding the number of parallel samples and filtering them using pre-trained reward models. However, applying this powerful methodology to the next-token prediction (NTP) paradigm remains challenging. The primary obstacle is the low correlation between the reward of an image decoded from an intermediate token sequence and the reward of the fully generated image. Consequently, these incomplete intermediate representations prove to be poor indicators for guiding the pruning direction, a limitation that stems from their inherent incompleteness in scale or semantic content. To effectively address this critical issue, we introduce the Filling-Based Reward (FR). This novel design estimates the approximate future trajectory of an intermediate sample by finding and applying a reasonable filling scheme to complete the sequence. Both the correlation coefficient between rewards of intermediate samples and final samples, as well as multiple intrinsic signals like token confidence, indicate that the FR provides an excellent and reliable metric for accurately evaluating the quality of intermediate samples. Building upon this foundation, we propose FR-TTS, a sophisticated scaling strategy. FR-TTS efficiently searches for good filling schemes and incorporates a diversity reward with a dynamic weighting schedule to achieve a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of intermediate samples. We experimentally validate the superiority of FR-TTS over multiple established benchmarks and various reward models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RecruitView, a dataset with multimodal behavioral data and proposes CRMF, a geometric deep learning model, achieving improved assessment performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in automated personality and soft skill assessment due to limited datasets and lack of methods capturing human traits' geometric structure.

Method: The authors present RecruitView dataset and propose CRMF, a framework leveraging hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean manifolds with geometry-specific expert networks and adaptive routing for behavioral trait assessment.

Result: CRMF achieves improved performance, with up to 11.4% better Spearman correlation and 6.0% higher concordance index while requiring 40-50% fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: CRMF significantly improves performance in soft skill and personality assessments and introduces a publicly available dataset for further research.

Abstract: Automated personality and soft skill assessment from multimodal behavioral data remains challenging due to limited datasets and methods that fail to capture geometric structure inherent in human traits. We introduce RecruitView, a dataset of 2,011 naturalistic video interview clips from 300+ participants with 27,000 pairwise comparative judgments across 12 dimensions: Big Five personality traits, overall personality score, and six interview performance metrics. To leverage this data, we propose Cross-Modal Regression with Manifold Fusion (CRMF), a geometric deep learning framework that explicitly models behavioral representations across hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean manifolds. CRMF employs geometry-specific expert networks to capture hierarchical trait structures, directional behavioral patterns, and continuous performance variations simultaneously. An adaptive routing mechanism dynamically weights expert contributions based on input characteristics. Through principled tangent space fusion, CRMF achieves superior performance while training 40-50% fewer trainable parameters than large multimodal models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRMF substantially outperforms the selected baselines, achieving up to 11.4% improvement in Spearman correlation and 6.0% in concordance index.

*Guanyu Hu,Tangzheng Lian,Dimitrios Kollias,Oya Celiktutan,Xinyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CausalAffect, a causal graph discovery framework for analyzing facial affect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of methods that infer psychologically plausible causal dependencies between Action Units (AUs) and expressions directly from data.

Method: CausalAffect utilizes polarity and direction-aware causal hierarchies to model AU-AU and AU-Expression links and employs counterfactual interventions to uncover true causality while avoiding spurious correlations.

Result: The model discovers causal structures aligning with psychological theories and demonstrates superior performance in AU detection and expression recognition across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalAffect establishes a link between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior, significantly advancing methods in this domain.

Abstract: Understanding human affect from facial behavior requires not only accurate recognition but also structured reasoning over the latent dependencies that drive muscle activations and their expressive outcomes. Although Action Units (AUs) have long served as the foundation of affective computing, existing approaches rarely address how to infer psychologically plausible causal relations between AUs and expressions directly from data. We propose CausalAffect, the first framework for causal graph discovery in facial affect analysis. CausalAffect models AU-AU and AU-Expression dependencies through a two-level polarity and direction aware causal hierarchy that integrates population-level regularities with sample-adaptive structures. A feature-level counterfactual intervention mechanism further enforces true causal effects while suppressing spurious correlations. Crucially, our approach requires neither jointly annotated datasets nor handcrafted causal priors, yet it recovers causal structures consistent with established psychological theories while revealing novel inhibitory and previously uncharacterized dependencies. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that CausalAffect advances the state of the art in both AU detection and expression recognition, establishing a principled connection between causal discovery and interpretable facial behavior. All trained models and source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Junyan Ye,Leiqi Zhu,Yuncheng Guo,Dongzhi Jiang,Zilong Huang,Yifan Zhang,Zhiyuan Yan,Haohuan Fu,Conghui He,Weijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealGen, a framework for improving photorealistic text-to-image generation by leveraging LLM-based prompt optimization, diffusion models, and a detector-based reward mechanism for realism. It also introduces RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image generation models, like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, fail to produce truly photorealistic images, often generating images with noticeable AI artifacts. There is a need to overcome these limitations and create indistinguishable-from-reality images.

Method: The RealGen framework incorporates a Large Language Model (LLM) to refine prompts, a diffusion model for realistic image synthesis, and a 'Detector Reward' mechanism to evaluate and improve realism by using synthetic image detectors. The GRPO algorithm is employed for optimizing the entire process. RealBench is proposed as an automated measurement tool for photorealism.

Result: RealGen surpasses both general and specialized models (like GPT-Image-1, Qwen-Image, FLUX-Krea) in generating realistic, detailed, and aesthetically pleasing images. RealBench also offers a reliable photorealism evaluation without requiring human intervention.

Conclusion: RealGen addresses the limitations in photorealistic text-to-image generation by combining novel methodologies and evaluation metrics, significantly advancing the quality and realism of generated images. The framework sets a benchmark in automated photorealism assessment.

Abstract: With the continuous advancement of image generation technology, advanced models such as GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image have achieved remarkable text-to-image consistency and world knowledge However, these models still fall short in photorealistic image generation. Even on simple T2I tasks, they tend to produce " fake" images with distinct AI artifacts, often characterized by "overly smooth skin" and "oily facial sheens". To recapture the original goal of "indistinguishable-from-reality" generation, we propose RealGen, a photorealistic text-to-image framework. RealGen integrates an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for realistic image generation. Inspired by adversarial generation, RealGen introduces a "Detector Reward" mechanism, which quantifies artifacts and assesses realism using both semantic-level and feature-level synthetic image detectors. We leverage this reward signal with the GRPO algorithm to optimize the entire generation pipeline, significantly enhancing image realism and detail. Furthermore, we propose RealBench, an automated evaluation benchmark employing Detector-Scoring and Arena-Scoring. It enables human-free photorealism assessment, yielding results that are more accurate and aligned with real user experience. Experiments demonstrate that RealGen significantly outperforms general models like GPT-Image-1 and Qwen-Image, as well as specialized photorealistic models like FLUX-Krea, in terms of realism, detail, and aesthetics.

*Xin Gu,Congcong Li,Xinyao Wang,Dexiang Hong,Libo Zhang,Tiejian Luo,Longyin Wen,Heng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called Structured Context Learning for Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD), offering structured context through the Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) for temporal information processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the detection of event boundaries in videos by providing a structured context for temporal modeling, addressing the limitations of existing approaches in terms of efficiency and generalizability.

Method: The method involves using SPoS to partition video frames into structured contexts, calculating group similarities to detect differences, and applying a lightweight convolutional network, along with Gaussian kernel preprocessing for boundary annotations.

Result: The method achieves superior performance on Kinetics-GEBD, TAPOS, and shot transition detection datasets, with better speed-accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust, flexible solution for GEBD with linear computational cost and general applicability to various datasets.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to identify moments in videos that humans perceive as event boundaries. This paper proposes a novel method for addressing this task, called Structured Context Learning, which introduces the Structured Partition of Sequence (SPoS) to provide a structured context for learning temporal information. Our approach is end-to-end trainable and flexible, not restricted to specific temporal models like GRU, LSTM, and Transformers. This flexibility enables our method to achieve a better speed-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, we apply SPoS to partition the input frame sequence and provide a structured context for the subsequent temporal model. Notably, SPoS's overall computational complexity is linear with respect to the video length. We next calculate group similarities to capture differences between frames, and a lightweight fully convolutional network is utilized to determine the event boundaries based on the grouped similarity maps. To remedy the ambiguities of boundary annotations, we adapt the Gaussian kernel to preprocess the ground-truth event boundaries. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the challenging Kinetics-GEBD, TAPOS, and shot transition detection datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TACS, a framework allowing ViTs to select examples that truly enhance task performance by aligning selection with task rewards, demonstrating consistent improvement over similarity-based methods across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of ViTs in resolving visual uncertainty through the selection of meaningful examples that improve predictions.

Method: The proposed Task-Aligned Context Selection (TACS) trains a selector network alongside the task model using a hybrid optimization method combining gradient-based supervision and reinforcement learning, thereby making retrieval part of the learning process.

Result: TACS outperforms similarity-based retrieval methods across 18 diverse datasets, particularly excelling in challenging and data-limited environments.

Conclusion: TACS enables better decision-making in discriminative models by learning to select contextual examples that genuinely aid performance, showcasing its advantage over similarity-based approaches in various settings.

Abstract: Humans often resolve visual uncertainty by comparing an image with relevant examples, but ViTs lack the ability to identify which examples would improve their predictions. We present Task-Aligned Context Selection (TACS), a framework that learns to select paired examples which truly improve task performance rather than those that merely appear similar. TACS jointly trains a selector network with the task model through a hybrid optimization scheme combining gradient-based supervision and reinforcement learning, making retrieval part of the learning objective. By aligning selection with task rewards, TACS enables discriminative models to discover which contextual examples genuinely help. Across 18 datasets covering fine-grained recognition, medical image classification, and medical image segmentation, TACS consistently outperforms similarity-based retrieval, particularly in challenging or data-limited settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for generating high-quality, coherent 3D scenes from a single 2D image, overcoming spatial inconsistency and pose estimation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in 3D scene generation methods, such as reliance on small datasets, spatial inconsistency, and inaccurate object pose estimations, which hinder coherent scene generation for AR/VR and embodied AI.

Method: CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator combining semantics-aware and structured latent representations, and introduces a camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm to ensure scene-level coherence.

Result: CC-FMO generates camera-aligned, semantically plausible, and high-fidelity 3D scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The approach improves instance fidelity and spatial consistency, marking significant progress in zero-shot 3D scene generation from single images for practical applications.

Abstract: High-quality 3D scene generation from a single image is crucial for AR/VR and embodied AI applications. Early approaches struggle to generalize due to reliance on specialized models trained on curated small datasets. While recent advancements in large-scale 3D foundation models have significantly enhanced instance-level generation, coherent scene generation remains a challenge, where performance is limited by inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency. To this end, this paper introduces CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for single-image to 3D scene generation that jointly conforms to the object layout in input image and preserves instance fidelity. CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator that combines semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, yielding object geometries that are both semantically plausible and high-quality. Furthermore, CC-FMO enables the application of foundational pose estimation models in the scene generation task via a simple yet effective camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm, to enforce scene-level coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.

*Tanaka Nobuaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a smartphone-based structured-light system to measure terrain unevenness using a proposed 2D-DTW algorithm for improved grid matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable low-cost mobile rovers to detect small terrain undulations that impact stability using a smartphone-compatible solution.

Method: Developed a smartphone-based structured-light system with a topology-constrained 2D-DTW algorithm for grid pattern matching under distortions.

Result: The proposed 2D-DTW algorithm successfully reconstructed local terrain unevenness and proved broadly applicable for structured grid matching in image processing.

Conclusion: The system effectively detects terrain irregularities using resource-efficient techniques and introduces a versatile 2D-DTW alignment tool.

Abstract: Low-cost mobile rovers often operate on uneven terrain where small bumps or tilts are difficult to perceive visually but can significantly affect locomotion stability. To address this problem, we explore a smartphone-based structured-light system that projects a grid pattern onto the ground and reconstructs local terrain unevenness from a single handheld device. The system is inspired by face-recognition projectors, but adapted for ground sensing. A key technical challenge is robustly matching the projected grid with its deformed observation under perspective distortion and partial occlusion. Conventional one-dimensional dynamic time warping (1D-DTW) is not directly applicable to such two-dimensional grid patterns. We therefore propose a topology-constrained two-dimensional dynamic time warping (2D-DTW) algorithm that performs column-wise alignment under a global grid consistency constraint. The proposed method is designed to be simple enough to run on resource limited platforms while preserving the grid structure required for accurate triangulation. We demonstrate that our 2D-DTW formulation can be used not only for terrain sensing but also as a general tool for matching structured grid patterns in image processing scenarios. This paper describes the overall system design as well as the 2D-DTW extension that emerged from this application.

*Ye Pang*

TL;DR: The paper adapts image generation models to serve as video-like robotic planners, using a framework of text-conditioned and trajectory-conditioned generation, achieving smooth robot videos using minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate perception, planning, and action in robots by exploring how pretrained image generation models can generate realistic and functionally useful robotic manipulation videos.

Method: Proposes a novel two-part framework: (1) text-conditioned generation using language instructions and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation using a 2D trajectory overlay with the initial frame, adapted through LoRA finetuning.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets (Jaco Play, Bridge V2, RT1) demonstrate the ability to produce coherent, smooth, and condition-aligned robot videos.

Conclusion: Pretrained image generators encode temporal priors effectively, enabling them to act as video-like robotic planners with minimal adjustments, supporting robotic planning tasks.

Abstract: Generating realistic robotic manipulation videos is an important step toward unifying perception, planning, and action in embodied agents. While existing video diffusion models require large domain-specific datasets and struggle to generalize, recent image generation models trained on language-image corpora exhibit strong compositionality, including the ability to synthesize temporally coherent grid images. This suggests a latent capacity for video-like generation even without explicit temporal modeling.
  We explore whether such models can serve as visual planners for robots when lightly adapted using LoRA finetuning. We propose a two-part framework that includes: (1) text-conditioned generation, which uses a language instruction and the first frame, and (2) trajectory-conditioned generation, which uses a 2D trajectory overlay and the same initial frame. Experiments on the Jaco Play dataset, Bridge V2, and the RT1 dataset show that both modes produce smooth, coherent robot videos aligned with their respective conditions.
  Our findings indicate that pretrained image generators encode transferable temporal priors and can function as video-like robotic planners under minimal supervision.

*Zeyuan An,Yanghang Xiao,Zhiying Leng,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a new framework for reconstructing and updating 3D scenes over time using sparse images and prior scene data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent 3D representations over time, particularly when only sparse-view observations are available, useful for applications like urban planning and disaster assessment.

Method: The method consists of three stages: cross-temporal camera alignment, interference-based confidence initialization, and progressive cross-temporal optimization to refine and update 3D scene reconstruction using sparse or historical data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing approaches in the quality of reconstruction and efficiency of data usage.

Conclusion: This approach is effective for updating and recovering 3D scenes, supporting applications such as digital twins and long-term spatial documentation under sparse data conditions.

Abstract: Maintaining consistent 3D scene representations over time is a significant challenge in computer vision. Updating 3D scenes from sparse-view observations is crucial for various real-world applications, including urban planning, disaster assessment, and historical site preservation, where dense scans are often unavailable or impractical. In this paper, we propose Cross-Temporal 3D Gaussian Splatting (Cross-Temporal 3DGS), a novel framework for efficiently reconstructing and updating 3D scenes across different time periods, using sparse images and previously captured scene priors. Our approach comprises three stages: 1) Cross-temporal camera alignment for estimating and aligning camera poses across different timestamps; 2) Interference-based confidence initialization to identify unchanged regions between timestamps, thereby guiding updates; and 3) Progressive cross-temporal optimization, which iteratively integrates historical prior information into the 3D scene to enhance reconstruction quality. Our method supports non-continuous capture, enabling not only updates using new sparse views to refine existing scenes, but also recovering past scenes from limited data with the help of current captures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve temporal changes using only sparse images, which can later be reconstructed into detailed 3D representations as needed. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods in reconstruction quality and data efficiency, making this approach a promising solution for scene versioning, cross-temporal digital twins, and long-term spatial documentation.

*Yongkang Hu,Yu Cheng,Yushuo Zhang,Yuan Xie,Zhaoxia Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAIDO, a novel framework for detecting AI-generated images, emphasizing scene-awareness and dynamic optimization to improve generalization and reduce errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing AI-generated image detection methods, which lack the ability to generalize to new generative methods and diverse content in real-world applications.

Method: A dynamic framework called SAIDO is proposed, consisting of a Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) for scene-specific feature learning and an Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM) to balance model flexibility and memory retention, particularly for continual learning.

Result: The proposed SAIDO framework reduces average detection error rates and forgetting rates by 44.22% and 40.57%, respectively, compared to SOTA methods. It also improves detection accuracy by 9.47% on open-world datasets.

Conclusion: SAIDO effectively overcomes challenges in detecting AI-generated images, with strong generalization capabilities and improved continual learning performance compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: The widespread misuse of image generation technologies has raised security concerns, driving the development of AI-generated image detection methods. However, generalization has become a key challenge and open problem: existing approaches struggle to adapt to emerging generative methods and content types in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a Scene-Aware and Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization detection framework with continual learning (SAIDO). Specifically, we design Scene-Awareness-Based Expert Module (SAEM) that dynamically identifies and incorporates new scenes using VLLMs. For each scene, independent expert modules are dynamically allocated, enabling the framework to capture scene-specific forgery features better and enhance cross-scene generalization. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when learning from multiple image generative methods, we introduce Importance-Guided Dynamic Optimization Mechanism (IDOM), which optimizes each neuron through an importance-guided gradient projection strategy, thereby achieving an effective balance between model plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments on continual learning tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms the current SOTA method in both stability and plasticity, achieving 44.22\% and 40.57\% relative reductions in average detection error rate and forgetting rate, respectively. On open-world datasets, it improves the average detection accuracy by 9.47\% compared to the current SOTA method.

*Sandika Biswas,Qianyi Wu,Biplab Banerjee,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of 3D geometry modeling in dynamic human-built environments involving multihuman, multiobject interactions using a hybrid approach to improve surface reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling 3D geometry of real-world, dynamic environments with multiple humans and objects interacts is crucial for AR/VR and embodied AI applications but faces challenges like motion diversity and occlusions, particularly within monocular settings.

Method: A hybrid approach combining three steps: 1) high-fidelity mesh generation using 3D generative models, 2) semantic-aware deformation of scene elements such as rigid transformations and LBS-based human deformation, and 3) refinement using Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based optimization.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the HOI-M3 dataset, showcasing better surface reconstruction and multiview consistency for multihuman, multiobject scenes.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic and occluded scenes, providing improved geometry modeling for multihuman, multiobject interactions, and enabling applications in AR/VR and gaming.

Abstract: Real-world human-built environments are highly dynamic, involving multiple humans and their complex interactions with surrounding objects. While 3D geometry modeling of such scenes is crucial for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and embodied AI, it remains underexplored due to challenges like diverse motion patterns and frequent occlusions. Beyond novel view rendering, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable progress in producing detailed, high-quality surface geometry with fast optimization of the underlying structure. However, very few GS-based methods address multihuman, multiobject scenarios, primarily due to the above-mentioned inherent challenges. In a monocular setup, these challenges are further amplified, as maintaining structural consistency under severe occlusion becomes difficult when the scene is optimized solely based on GS-based rendering loss. To tackle the challenges of such a multihuman, multiobject dynamic scene, we propose a hybrid approach that effectively combines the advantages of 1) 3D generative models for generating high-fidelity meshes of the scene elements, 2) Semantic-aware deformation, \ie rigid transformation of the rigid objects and LBS-based deformation of the humans, and mapping of the deformed high-fidelity meshes in the dynamic scene, and 3) GS-based optimization of the individual elements for further refining their alignments in the scene. Such a hybrid approach helps maintain the object structures even under severe occlusion and can produce multiview and temporally consistent geometry. We choose HOI-M3 for evaluation, as, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only dataset featuring multihuman, multiobject interactions in a dynamic scene. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing better surface reconstruction of such scenes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroVolve, a generative framework for brain-guided image synthesis using pretrained vision-language models, allowing exploration of neural interactions in visual representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what visual information is encoded in individual brain regions and how distributed patterns combine to create neural representations, with an emphasis on complex and naturalistic vision.

Method: NeuroVolve uses a generative framework to optimize a neural objective function in the embedding space of pretrained vision-language models to generate images guided by programmable neural constraints.

Result: NeuroVolve replicates known brain-region selectivity, synthesizes coherent scenes for multi-region constraints, and reveals semantic trajectories in embedding space. It demonstrates the ability to generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli aligned with curated neural objectives.

Conclusion: The framework exposes cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships across brain regions, supports subject-specific preferences, and offers interpretable tools for mapping and probing neural representation of visual information.

Abstract: What visual information is encoded in individual brain regions, and how do distributed patterns combine to create their neural representations? Prior work has used generative models to replicate known category selectivity in isolated regions (e.g., faces in FFA), but these approaches offer limited insight into how regions interact during complex, naturalistic vision. We introduce NeuroVolve, a generative framework that provides brain-guided image synthesis via optimization of a neural objective function in the embedding space of a pretrained vision-language model. Images are generated under the guidance of a programmable neural objective, i.e., activating or deactivating single regions or multiple regions together. NeuroVolve is validated by recovering known selectivity for individual brain regions, while expanding to synthesize coherent scenes that satisfy complex, multi-region constraints. By tracking optimization steps, it reveals semantic trajectories through embedding space, unifying brain-guided image editing and preferred stimulus generation in a single process. We show that NeuroVolve can generate both low-level and semantic feature-specific stimuli for single ROIs, as well as stimuli aligned to curated neural objectives. These include co-activation and decorrelation between regions, exposing cooperative and antagonistic tuning relationships. Notably, the framework captures subject-specific preferences, supporting personalized brain-driven synthesis and offering interpretable constraints for mapping, analyzing, and probing neural representations of visual information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods that struggle to balance rich open-vocabulary semantic descriptions and real-time performance when grounding them in 3D environments.

Method: DAAAM introduces an optimization-based frontend for efficient semantic generation from localized captioning models, builds a hierarchical 4D scene graph for spatio-temporal memory representation, and ensures real-time processing with batch processing.

Result: DAAAM demonstrates state-of-the-art results on spatio-temporal question answering tasks, achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and error reduction on the NaVQA and SG3D benchmarks.

Conclusion: By combining detailed language-grounding capabilities with real-time processing, DAAAM enables robust spatio-temporal scene understanding and reasoning, making advancements in applications like robotics and augmented reality. The data and code are released as open source.

Abstract: Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D. To address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.
  We thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively. We release our data and code open-source.

Motivation: To prevent injuries due to incorrect yoga poses by developing an automated, accurate yoga pose classification system.

Method: The study evaluates three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception) with three input modalities (images, MediaPipe Pose, and YOLOv8 Pose) and uses Grad-CAM for interpretability analysis.

Result: Skeleton-based inputs outperformed raw images, with MediaPipe Pose skeleton and VGG16 achieving the highest accuracy of 96.09%.

Conclusion: Skeleton-based representations are effective for yoga pose classification, and the 'Yoga-16' dataset with Grad-CAM analysis provides a strong foundation for future studies.

Abstract: Yoga is a popular form of exercise worldwide due to its spiritual and physical health benefits, but incorrect postures can lead to injuries. Automated yoga pose classification has therefore gained importance to reduce reliance on expert practitioners. While human pose keypoint extraction models have shown high potential in action recognition, systematic benchmarking for yoga pose recognition remains limited, as prior works often focus solely on raw images or a single pose extraction model. In this study, we introduce a curated dataset, 'Yoga-16', which addresses limitations of existing datasets, and systematically evaluate three deep learning architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception) using three input modalities (direct images, MediaPipe Pose skeleton images, and YOLOv8 Pose skeleton images). Our experiments demonstrate that skeleton-based representations outperform raw image inputs, with the highest accuracy of 96.09% achieved by VGG16 with MediaPipe Pose skeleton input. Additionally, we provide interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM, offering insights into model decision-making for yoga pose classification with cross validation analysis.

*Yue Jiang,Haiwei Xue,Minghao Han,Mingcheng Li,Xiaolu Hou,Dingkang Yang,Lihua Zhang,Xu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SatireDecoder, a framework to improve comprehension of visual satire using a multi-agent system and chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ability to understand visual satire, which combines humor with critique, is challenging for current vision-language models due to their difficulty in integrating local and global contexts effectively.

Method: The authors developed SatireDecoder, employing a multi-agent system to decompose images into detailed semantic representations and a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis.

Result: SatireDecoder significantly enhances accuracy in understanding complex visual satire while reducing misinterpretations and hallucinations, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates potential in advancing vision-language reasoning for nuanced tasks involving high-level semantic understanding in visual satire.

Abstract: Satire, a form of artistic expression combining humor with implicit critique, holds significant social value by illuminating societal issues. Despite its cultural and societal significance, satire comprehension, particularly in purely visual forms, remains a challenging task for current vision-language models. This task requires not only detecting satire but also deciphering its nuanced meaning and identifying the implicated entities. Existing models often fail to effectively integrate local entity relationships with global context, leading to misinterpretation, comprehension biases, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose SatireDecoder, a training-free framework designed to enhance satirical image comprehension. Our approach proposes a multi-agent system performing visual cascaded decoupling to decompose images into fine-grained local and global semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy guided by uncertainty analysis, which breaks down the complex satire comprehension process into sequential subtasks with minimized uncertainty. Our method significantly improves interpretive accuracy while reducing hallucinations. Experimental results validate that SatireDecoder outperforms existing baselines in comprehending visual satire, offering a promising direction for vision-language reasoning in nuanced, high-level semantic tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedCT-VLM, a vision-language framework for adapting CT models to medical imaging tasks using parameter-efficient techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to adapt large-scale vision-language models for medical imaging tasks, addressing limitations in applying these models to 3D volumetric medical data, like CT scans.

Method: The paper presents MedCT-VLM, which uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to modify vision and text encoder attention layers without fine-tuning the entire model. This method adjusts only 0.38% of the parameters, allowing efficient adaptation.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning significantly enhances the zero-shot classification performance for thoracic pathologies, improving metrics such as mean AUROC by +7.6 percentage points, accuracy by +6.4 percentage points, and macro-F1 by +4.8 percentage points.

Conclusion: The study concludes that parameter-efficient approaches like LoRA can successfully transfer pretraining benefits to medical imaging tasks, particularly aiding zero-shot scenarios with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Foundation models trained via vision-language pretraining have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse image domains, yet their application to volumetric medical imaging remains limited. We introduce MedCT-VLM: Medical CT Vision-Language Model, a parameter-efficient vision-language framework designed to adapt large-scale CT foundation models for downstream clinical tasks. MedCT-VLM uses a parameter-efficient approach to adapt CT-CLIP, a contrastive vision-language model trained on 25,692 chest CT volumes, for multi-label pathology classification using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Rather than fine-tuning the model's 440 M parameters directly, we insert low-rank decomposition matrices into attention layers of both vision and text encoders, training only 1.67M parameters (0.38\% of total). We evaluate on zero-shot classification across 18 thoracic pathologies, where the model must align CT embeddings with unseen text prompts at inference without task-specific training. LoRA fine-tuning improves mean AUROC from 61.3\% to 68.9\% (+7.6 pp), accuracy from 67.2\% to 73.6\% (+6.4 pp), and macro-F1 from 32.1\% to 36.9\% (+4.8 pp). These results demonstrate that parameter-efficient methods can effectively transfer large-scale pretraining to downstream medical imaging tasks, particularly for zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

TL;DR: This study investigates deep learning's application for automating pith detection in tree cross-sections, finding Swin Transformer most accurate, with other models offering varying strengths and trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate pith detection in tree cross-sections, traditionally a manual and error-prone task, by utilizing deep learning techniques.

Method: The study evaluates five deep learning models (YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, Mask R-CNN) on a dataset of 582 labeled images, supported by data augmentation. Generalizability was tested on a smaller oak dataset and other labeled datasets.

Result: Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94). Other models like YOLOv9 and U-Net showed strengths in specific aspects, while Mask R-CNN improved using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).

Conclusion: Deep learning offers great potential for automating tree cross-section pith detection, with model selection driven by dataset traits and intended use cases.

Abstract: Pith detection in tree cross-sections is essential for forestry and wood quality analysis but remains a manual, error-prone task. This study evaluates deep learning models -- YOLOv9, U-Net, Swin Transformer, DeepLabV3, and Mask R-CNN -- to automate the process efficiently. A dataset of 582 labeled images was dynamically augmented to improve generalization. Swin Transformer achieved the highest accuracy (0.94), excelling in fine segmentation. YOLOv9 performed well for bounding box detection but struggled with boundary precision. U-Net was effective for structured patterns, while DeepLabV3 captured multi-scale features with slight boundary imprecision. Mask R-CNN initially underperformed due to overlapping detections, but applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) improved its IoU from 0.45 to 0.80. Generalizability was next tested using an oak dataset of 11 images from Oregon State University's Tree Ring Lab. Additionally, for exploratory analysis purposes, an additional dataset of 64 labeled tree cross-sections was used to train the worst-performing model to see if this would improve its performance generalizing to the unseen oak dataset. Key challenges included tensor mismatches and boundary inconsistencies, addressed through hyperparameter tuning and augmentation. Our results highlight deep learning's potential for tree cross-section pith detection, with model choice depending on dataset characteristics and application needs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study develops a trustworthy, high-accuracy CAD system for diagnosing multi-class skin lesions using enhanced data balance and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome class imbalance in skin lesion datasets, improve diagnostic accuracy, and add interpretability to deep learning models for clinical applications.

Method: DCGANs were applied for data augmentation, followed by fine-tuning of a ResNet-50 classifier. LIME and SHAP were incorporated for explainable AI and feature relevance validation.

Result: The system achieved 92.50% accuracy and a Macro-AUC of 98.82%, surpassing prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability, though future efforts should improve performance for critical categories like Melanoma NOS.

Abstract: Accurate and timely diagnosis of multi-class skin lesions is hampered by subjective methods, inherent data imbalance in datasets like HAM10000, and the "black box" nature of Deep Learning (DL) models. This study proposes a trustworthy and highly accurate Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to overcome these limitations. The approach utilizes Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) for per class data augmentation to resolve the critical class imbalance problem. A fine-tuned ResNet-50 classifier is then trained on the augmented dataset to classify seven skin disease categories. Crucially, LIME and SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are integrated to provide transparency by confirming that predictions are based on clinically relevant features like irregular morphology. The system achieved a high overall Accuracy of 92.50 % and a Macro-AUC of 98.82 %, successfully outperforming various prior benchmarked architectures. This work successfully validates a verifiable framework that combines high performance with the essential clinical interpretability required for safe diagnostic deployment. Future research should prioritize enhancing discrimination for critical categories, such as Melanoma NOS (F1-Score is 0.8602).

*Razieh Ghaedi,AmirReza BabaAhmadi,Reyer Zwiggelaar,Xinqi Fan,Nashid Alam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAT-ADA, a framework combining a ResNet-50 backbone with a batch-level Graph Attention Network (GAT) and multiple alignment techniques to tackle cross-domain facial expression recognition (CD-FER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the challenge of domain shift in CD-FER, where discrepancies between training and deployment data reduce model generalization and performance.

Method: GAT-ADA employs a combination of ResNet-50 for feature extraction, GAT for modeling inter-sample relations, adversarial domain alignment using Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), and statistical alignment via CORAL and MMD.

Result: Under unsupervised domain adaptation, GAT-ADA achieves a mean cross-domain accuracy of 74.39% and significantly outperforms baselines with 98.0% accuracy on the RAF-DB to FER2013 task.

Conclusion: The proposed GAT-ADA demonstrates the effectiveness of combining graph attention and hybrid alignment strategies in improving CD-FER across different datasets and addressing domain shifts.

Abstract: Cross-domain facial expression recognition (CD-FER) remains difficult due to severe domain shift between training and deployment data. We propose Graph-Attention Network with Adversarial Domain Alignment (GAT-ADA), a hybrid framework that couples a ResNet-50 as backbone with a batch-level Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model inter-sample relations under shift. Each mini-batch is cast as a sparse ring graph so that attention aggregates cross-sample cues that are informative for adaptation. To align distributions, GAT-ADA combines adversarial learning via a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) with statistical alignment using CORAL and MMD. GAT-ADA is evaluated under a standard unsupervised domain adaptation protocol: training on one labeled source (RAF-DB) and adapting to multiple unlabeled targets (CK+, JAFFE, SFEW 2.0, FER2013, and ExpW). GAT-ADA attains 74.39% mean cross-domain accuracy. On RAF-DB to FER2013, it reaches 98.0% accuracy, corresponding to approximately a 36-point improvement over the best baseline we re-implemented with the same backbone and preprocessing.

### [251] [MambaScope: Coarse-to-Fine Scoping for Efficient Vision Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00647)
*Shanhui Liu,Rui Xu,Yunke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CF-ViM, an adaptive method for efficient image inference by dynamically adjusting resolution based on image complexity, outperforming existing techniques on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency of Vision Mamba caused by the large number of input tokens and information loss in existing token reduction techniques.

Method: The authors introduce CF-ViM, which processes images initially at a coarse resolution. For images where prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-evaluated at a finer resolution. This dynamic assignment adapts to image complexity.

Result: CF-ViM achieves better accuracy and efficiency compared to standard Vision Mamba and other token reduction methods, as demonstrated in ImageNet experiments.

Conclusion: By adaptively assigning computational resources based on image complexity, CF-ViM maintains efficiency while preserving essential visual details, making it a superior approach to existing methods.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a promising and efficient alternative to Vision Transformers, yet its efficiency remains fundamentally constrained by the number of input tokens. Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss, as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is exacerbated when applied uniformly to fine-grained token representations across all images, regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing. Simple images can be effectively handled at coarse resolution, while only complex ones may warrant refinement. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Coarse-to-Fine Vision Mamba (CF-ViM)}, an adaptive framework for efficient inference. CF-ViM first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing the token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover critical visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows CF-ViM to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, ensuring efficient processing without compromising essential visual information. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that CF-ViM outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

*Kiri L. Wagstaff*

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of recognizing multi-digit handwriting by creating more realistic benchmark datasets based on multi-digit writer data. Better solutions are needed for real-world recognition problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between isolated digit classification and real-world multi-digit number recognition, which is necessary for tasks like ZIP Codes, handwritten amounts, and appointment times.

Method: The authors use knowledge about digit writers from NIST images to create benchmark datasets for multi-digit writer scenarios, introducing new performance metrics tailored to real-world applications.

Result: The study highlights that classifiers excelling in isolated digit recognition struggle with multi-digit recognition, emphasizing the need for new approaches.

Conclusion: Solving real-world number recognition challenges requires methods that utilize task-specific knowledge and go beyond isolated digit classification approaches.

Abstract: Isolated digit classification has served as a motivating problem for decades of machine learning research. In real settings, numbers often occur as multiple digits, all written by the same person. Examples include ZIP Codes, handwritten check amounts, and appointment times. In this work, we leverage knowledge about the writers of NIST digit images to create more realistic benchmark multi-digit writer (MDW) data sets. As expected, we find that classifiers may perform well on isolated digits yet do poorly on multi-digit number recognition. If we want to solve real number recognition problems, additional advances are needed. The MDW benchmarks come with task-specific performance metrics that go beyond typical error calculations to more closely align with real-world impact. They also create opportunities to develop methods that can leverage task-specific knowledge to improve performance well beyond that of individual digit classification methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free framework for text-driven editing of 4D dynamic scenes, addressing issues of motion distortion and inconsistency found in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with text-driven 4D scene editing due to challenges in maintaining multi-view and temporal consistency, as well as avoiding motion distortion and geometric drift when relying on 2D diffusion models.

Method: The authors design Dynamic-eDiTor using MM-DiT and 4DGS, incorporating Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for local consistency and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation without requiring additional training.

Result: Experiments on the DyNeRF dataset show that Dynamic-eDiTor outperforms prior approaches with higher editing fidelity, multi-view consistency, and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Dynamic-eDiTor provides an effective and seamless solution for editing 4D scenes driven by text, achieving better results than existing methods without needing extra training.

Abstract: Recent progress in 4D representations, such as Dynamic NeRF and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), has enabled dynamic 4D scene reconstruction. However, text-driven 4D scene editing remains under-explored due to the challenge of ensuring both multi-view and temporal consistency across space and time during editing. Existing studies rely on 2D diffusion models that edit frames independently, often causing motion distortion, geometric drift, and incomplete editing. We introduce Dynamic-eDiTor, a training-free text-driven 4D editing framework leveraging Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) and 4DGS. This mechanism consists of Spatio-Temporal Sub-Grid Attention (STGA) for locally consistent cross-view and temporal fusion, and Context Token Propagation (CTP) for global propagation via token inheritance and optical-flow-guided token replacement. Together, these components allow Dynamic-eDiTor to perform seamless, globally consistent multi-view video without additional training and directly optimize pre-trained source 4DGS. Extensive experiments on multi-view video dataset DyNeRF demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing fidelity and both multi-view and temporal consistency prior approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationGait introduces a scalable and generalizable framework for gait pattern analysis, achieving remarkable results in diverse tasks and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous gait models struggled with scalability and generalization, limiting their ability to handle diverse datasets and tasks effectively.

Method: Introduces FoundationGait, a self-supervised pretraining framework with 0.13 billion parameters, trained on over 2 million walking sequences from 12 public gait datasets.

Result: FoundationGait achieved notable zero-shot performance, including 48.0% rank-1 accuracy on Gait3D and 64.5% on OU-MVLP, while excelling in various gait-related tasks.

Conclusion: FoundationGait represents a significant advancement in gait analysis, overcoming scalability and generalization challenges, and showcases the potential to unify diverse gait-related applications.

Abstract: Gait patterns play a critical role in human identification and healthcare analytics, yet current progress remains constrained by small, narrowly designed models that fail to scale or generalize. Building a unified gait foundation model requires addressing two longstanding barriers: (a) Scalability. Why have gait models historically failed to follow scaling laws? (b) Generalization. Can one model serve the diverse gait tasks that have traditionally been studied in isolation? We introduce FoundationGait, the first scalable, self-supervised pretraining framework for gait understanding. Its largest version has nearly 0.13 billion parameters and is pretrained on 12 public gait datasets comprising over 2 million walking sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationGait, with or without fine-tuning, performs robustly across a wide spectrum of gait datasets, conditions, tasks (e.g., human identification, scoliosis screening, depression prediction, and attribute estimation), and even input modality. Notably, it achieves 48.0% zero-shot rank-1 accuracy on the challenging in-the-wild Gait3D dataset (1,000 test subjects) and 64.5% on the largest in-the-lab OU-MVLP dataset (5,000+ test subjects), setting a new milestone in robust gait recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Affordance-First Decomposition (AFD) for continual video-language learning, achieving state-of-the-art results by stabilizing a shared substrate and focusing adaptation efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve continual learning for video-language tasks without static routing or excessive reliance on past data, while handling non-stationary data, domains, and query styles.

Method: The proposed method, Affordance-First Decomposition (AFD), separates stability and plasticity by mapping videos to affordance tokens (stable) and using a query-routed scheduler (adaptive) with memory-efficient mechanisms.

Result: AFD delivers state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like domain-incremental VideoQA (51.6% accuracy) and ViLCo, with reduced forgetting and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: AFD explicitly delineates stable and adaptive components in continual video-language understanding, balancing innovation with robustness and privacy.

Abstract: Continual learning for video--language understanding is increasingly important as models face non-stationary data, domains, and query styles, yet prevailing solutions blur what should stay stable versus what should adapt, rely on static routing/capacity, or require replaying past videos. We aim to explicitly specify where stability lives and where plasticity should be focused under realistic memory and privacy constraints. We introduce Affordance-First Decomposition (AFD): videos are mapped to slowly varying affordance tokens that form a shared, time-aligned substrate, while a lightweight, query-routed, conflict-aware scheduler concentrates adaptation and grows capacity only when needed. The substrate is stabilized via weak alignment and teacher consistency, and training uses question-only replay. AFD achieves state-of-the-art across protocols: 51.6% average accuracy with -1.8% forgetting on domain-incremental VideoQA, ViLCo R@1@0.5 of 29.6% (MQ) and 20.7% (NLQ) with 18.4% stAP@0.25 (VQ), and 39.5% accuracy with -1.6% forgetting on time-incremental iVQA. Overall, AFD offers an explicit, interpretable split between a stable interaction-centered substrate and targeted adaptation.

Motivation: To unlock and utilize the vast amount of unlabeled human demonstration data in industrial videos for VLA model pre-training, addressing the challenges of unstructured data and scalability.

Method: The method involves training a motion tokenizer for motion dynamics, using a novel 'Latent Action Energy' metric for unsupervised segmentation of action primitives, and organizing the data into structured output for VLA pre-training.

Result: The framework effectively segments and organizes human actions from industrial video streams, demonstrated on both public benchmarks and proprietary datasets, achieving semantic coherence validated through clustering and Vision-Language Model assessments.

Conclusion: This system is the first fully automated approach to extract and structure VLA pre-training data from industrial videos, enabling scalable embodied AI deployment in manufacturing.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Result: Demonstrated through both synthetic and real-world image experiments, the model effectively removes motion blur and restores fine details.

Conclusion: CAR-net is efficient and capable for semi-blind image deblurring of rotational motion blur, with resources and codes publicly released.

Abstract: We propose a new neural network architecture called CAR-net (CAscade Refinement Network) to deblur images that are subject to rotational motion blur. Our architecture is specifically designed for the semi-blind scenarios where only noisy information of the rotational motion blur angle is available. The core of our approach is progressive refinement process that starts with an initial deblurred estimate obtained from frequency-domain inversion; A series of refinement stages take the current deblurred image to predict and apply residual correction to the current estimate, progressively suppressing artifacts and restoring fine details. To handle parameter uncertainty, our architecture accommodates an optional angle detection module which can be trained end-to-end with refinement modules. We provide a detailed description of our architecture and illustrate its efficiency through experiments using both synthetic and real-life images.

Result: The approach drastically reduces hallucination rates on multiple benchmarks and enables an open-source model to surpass GPT-4V's performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate hallucination in LVLMs and unlock the potential of open-source models, offering significant advancements for multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have risen to be a promising approach for multimodal tasks. However, principled hallucination mitigation remains a critical challenge.In this work, we first analyze the data generation process in LVLM hallucination mitigation and affirm that on-policy data significantly outperforms off-policy data, which thus calls for efficient and reliable preference annotation of on-policy data. We then point out that, existing annotation methods introduce additional hallucination in training samples, which may enhance the model's hallucination patterns, to address this problem, we propose training a hallucination classifier giving binary annotations, which guarantee clean chosen samples for the subsequent alignment. To further harness of the power of on-policy data, we design a robust iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm adopting a dynamic sample reweighting scheme. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks with comparison to 8 state-of-the-art baselines. In particular, our approach reduces the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B on MMHalBench by 50.8% and the average hallucination rate on Object HalBench by 79.5%; more significantly, our method fully taps into the potential of open-source models, enabling LLaVA-1.5-13B to even surpass the performance of GPT-4V.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IIS methods struggle with remote sensing images due to limited annotated data and computational issues, necessitating a new approach tailored to this domain.

Method: RS-ISRefiner utilizes an adapter-based tuning strategy with a hybrid attention mechanism and improved probability map modulation to address remote sensing-specific characteristics.

Result: RS-ISRefiner showed superior performance over state-of-the-art IIS methods in six remote sensing datasets across segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and interaction cost.

Conclusion: RS-ISRefiner effectively enhances segmentation performance and is generalizable for high-quality instance segmentation in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Interactive image segmentation(IIS) plays a critical role in generating precise annotations for remote sensing imagery, where objects often exhibit scale variations, irregular boundaries and complex backgrounds. However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost. These results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our framework, making it highly suitable for high-quality instance segmentation in practical remote sensing scenarios.

Motivation: The high cost of manual perception annotation in autonomous driving motivates the need for cost-effective, annotation-free planning paradigms.

Method: The authors propose TrajDiff, which uses raw sensor inputs and future trajectory to create Gaussian BEV heatmap targets. This is supported by a trajectory-oriented BEV encoder and a BEV Diffusion Transformer to predict diverse trajectories without handcrafted priors.

Result: Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, TrajDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance (87.5 PDMS) among annotation-free methods and improves further to 88.5 PDMS with data scaling.

Conclusion: TrajDiff proves the feasibility of annotation-free methods for autonomous driving tasks, providing performance comparable to perception-based approaches and opening avenues for data-scaled improvements.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems directly generate driving policies from raw sensor inputs. While these systems can extract effective environmental features for planning, relying on auxiliary perception tasks, developing perception annotation-free planning paradigms has become increasingly critical due to the high cost of manual perception annotation. In this work, we propose TrajDiff, a Trajectory-oriented BEV Conditioned Diffusion framework that establishes a fully perception annotation-free generative method for end-to-end autonomous driving. TrajDiff requires only raw sensor inputs and future trajectory, constructing Gaussian BEV heatmap targets that inherently capture driving modalities. We design a simple yet effective trajectory-oriented BEV encoder to extract the TrajBEV feature without perceptual supervision. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-oriented BEV Diffusion Transformer (TB-DiT), which leverages ego-state information and the predicted TrajBEV features to directly generate diverse yet plausible trajectories, eliminating the need for handcrafted motion priors. Beyond architectural innovations, TrajDiff enables exploration of data scaling benefits in the annotation-free setting. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, TrajDiff achieves 87.5 PDMS, establishing state-of-the-art performance among all annotation-free methods. With data scaling, it further improves to 88.5 PDMS, which is comparable to advanced perception-based approaches. Our code and model will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: Multi-GRPO resolves critical GRPO issues, presenting a reliable and efficient solution for text-to-image model alignment with improved credit assignment and conflict resolution. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promising potential for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models, yet existing GRPO-based methods suffer from two critical limitations. (1) \textit{Shared credit assignment}: trajectory-level advantages derived from group-normalized sparse terminal rewards are uniformly applied across timesteps, failing to accurately estimate the potential of early denoising steps with vast exploration spaces. (2) \textit{Reward-mixing}: predefined weights for combining multi-objective rewards (e.g., text accuracy, visual quality, text color)--which have mismatched scales and variances--lead to unstable gradients and conflicting updates. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Multi-GRPO}, a multi-group advantage estimation framework with two orthogonal grouping mechanisms. For better credit assignment, we introduce tree-based trajectories inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search: branching trajectories at selected early denoising steps naturally forms \emph{temporal groups}, enabling accurate advantage estimation for early steps via descendant leaves while amortizing computation through shared prefixes. For multi-objective optimization, we introduce \emph{reward-based grouping} to compute advantages for each reward function \textit{independently} before aggregation, disentangling conflicting signals. To facilitate evaluation of multiple objective alignment, we curate \textit{OCR-Color-10}, a visual text rendering dataset with explicit color constraints. Across the single-reward \textit{PickScore-25k} and multi-objective \textit{OCR-Color-10} benchmarks, Multi-GRPO achieves superior stability and alignment performance, effectively balancing conflicting objectives.

*Zhengxin Chen,Xiaohai He,Tingrong Zhang,Shuhua Xiong,Chao Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new image compression method combining Prior-guided Convolution (PGConv) and Multi-scale Gated Transformer (MGT) to enhance feature extraction capabilities, achieving better performance and complexity trade-offs than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to surpass traditional image codecs and enhance existing learned image compression methods through more effective local and non-local feature extraction.

Method: The authors propose PGConv for local feature extraction with asymmetric and difference convolutions, and MGT for non-local features using dilated multi-head self-attention and gated mechanisms. These are combined into the MGTPCN framework.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that MGTPCN outperforms state-of-the-art compression algorithms with a superior balance between performance and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The novel MGTPCN framework achieves improved image compression by advancing feature extraction methods and balancing performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression methods have made remarkable achievements, some of which have outperformed the traditional image codec VVC. The advantages of learned image compression methods over traditional image codecs can be largely attributed to their powerful nonlinear transform coding. Convolutional layers and shifted window transformer (Swin-T) blocks are the basic units of neural networks, and their representation capabilities play an important role in nonlinear transform coding. In this paper, to improve the ability of the vanilla convolution to extract local features, we propose a novel prior-guided convolution (PGConv), where asymmetric convolutions (AConvs) and difference convolutions (DConvs) are introduced to strengthen skeleton elements and extract high-frequency information, respectively. A re-parameterization strategy is also used to reduce the computational complexity of PGConv. Moreover, to improve the ability of the Swin-T block to extract non-local features, we propose a novel multi-scale gated transformer (MGT), where dilated window-based multi-head self-attention blocks with different dilation rates and depth-wise convolution layers with different kernel sizes are used to extract multi-scale features, and a gate mechanism is introduced to enhance non-linearity. Finally, we propose a novel joint Multi-scale Gated Transformer and Prior-guided Convolutional Network (MGTPCN) for learned image compression. Experimental results show that our MGTPCN surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms with a better trade-off between performance and complexity.

*Ke Liu,Shangde Gao,Yichao Fu,Shangqi Gao,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProSeg, a probabilistic model to address multi-rater medical segmentation challenges, achieving expert-personalized and diverse results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-rater medical image segmentation caused by ambiguous boundaries and inter-observer variability, and improve both diversity and expert specificity in segmentation outcomes.

Method: ProSeg is proposed, utilizing two latent variables to model expert preferences and boundary ambiguity, with segmentation outputs generated via variational inference.

Result: ProSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and lung nodule (LIDC-IDRI) datasets, delivering diverse and expert-specific segmentation results.

Conclusion: ProSeg successfully enables both personalization and diversity in medical image segmentation, advancing the field with its probabilistic modeling approach.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is inherently influenced by data uncertainty, arising from ambiguous boundaries in medical scans and inter-observer variability in diagnosis. To address this challenge, previous works formulated the multi-rater medical image segmentation task, where multiple experts provide separate annotations for each image. However, existing models are typically constrained to either generate diverse segmentation that lacks expert specificity or to produce personalized outputs that merely replicate individual annotators. We propose Probabilistic modeling of multi-rater medical image Segmentation (ProSeg) that simultaneously enables both diversification and personalization. Specifically, we introduce two latent variables to model expert annotation preferences and image boundary ambiguity. Their conditional probabilistic distributions are then obtained through variational inference, allowing segmentation outputs to be generated by sampling from these distributions. Extensive experiments on both the nasopharyngeal carcinoma dataset (NPC) and the lung nodule dataset (LIDC-IDRI) demonstrate that our ProSeg achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, providing segmentation results that are both diverse and expert-personalized.

### [265] [Charts Are Not Images: On the Challenges of Scientific Chart Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00752)
*Shawn Li,Ryan Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Sunav Choudhary,Franck Dernoncourt,Puneet Mathur,Zhengzhong Tu,Yue Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FigEdit, a benchmark specifically designed for scientific figure editing, highlighting the inadequacies of current generative models in handling structured data transformations inherent to charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models excel at natural image editing but fail in scientific figure editing due to treating charts as unstructured pixel arrangements instead of structured data governed by graphical grammar.

Method: The authors developed FigEdit, a large-scale benchmark with over 30,000 samples, covering diverse chart types and complex editing scenarios. It includes tasks like single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly on FigEdit, showing limitations in executing structured transformations. Traditional evaluation metrics fail to capture semantic correctness in chart edits.

Conclusion: FigEdit exposes the limitations of current pixel-based generative models for chart editing and emphasizes the need for structure-aware models. The benchmark provides a foundation for systematic progress in understanding both visual and semantic aspects of scientific charts.

Abstract: Generative models, such as diffusion and autoregressive approaches, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in editing natural images. However, applying these tools to scientific charts rests on a flawed assumption: a chart is not merely an arrangement of pixels but a visual representation of structured data governed by a graphical grammar. Consequently, chart editing is not a pixel-manipulation task but a structured transformation problem. To address this fundamental mismatch, we introduce \textit{FigEdit}, a large-scale benchmark for scientific figure editing comprising over 30,000 samples. Grounded in real-world data, our benchmark is distinguished by its diversity, covering 10 distinct chart types and a rich vocabulary of complex editing instructions. The benchmark is organized into five distinct and progressively challenging tasks: single edits, multi edits, conversational edits, visual-guidance-based edits, and style transfer. Our evaluation of a range of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark reveals their poor performance on scientific figures, as they consistently fail to handle the underlying structured transformations required for valid edits. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that traditional evaluation metrics (e.g., SSIM, PSNR) have limitations in capturing the semantic correctness of chart edits. Our benchmark demonstrates the profound limitations of pixel-level manipulation and provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating future structure-aware models. By releasing \textit{FigEdit} (https://github.com/adobe-research/figure-editing), we aim to enable systematic progress in structure-aware figure editing, provide a common ground for fair comparison, and encourage future research on models that understand both the visual and semantic layers of scientific charts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to model invisible forces causing motion, such as wind by using videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the invisible forces behind object motions like the wind causing a leaf to fall remains largely unexplored though crucial.

Method: It proposes a differentiable inverse graphics framework to model object geometry, physical properties, and interactions using video backpropagation.

Result: The method accurately infers force fields from videos in both synthetic and real-world tests.

Conclusion: This approach bridges vision and physics, enabling innovations in physics-based video generation and editing.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computer vision is to model motions from videos, while the representations behind motions, i.e. the invisible physical interactions that cause objects to deform and move, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study how to recover the invisible forces from visual observations, e.g., estimating the wind field by observing a leaf falling to the ground. Our key innovation is an end-to-end differentiable inverse graphics framework, which jointly models object geometry, physical properties, and interactions directly from videos. Through backpropagation, our approach enables the recovery of force representations from object motions. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, and the results demonstrate its ability to infer plausible force fields from videos. Furthermore, we show the potential applications of our approach, including physics-based video generation and editing. We hope our approach sheds light on understanding and modeling the physical process behind pixels, bridging the gap between vision and physics.

*Chaojun Ni,Cheng Chen,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Wenzhao Zheng,Boyuan Wang,Tianrun Chen,Guosheng Zhao,Haoyun Li,Zhehao Dong,Qiang Zhang,Yun Ye,Yang Wang,Guan Huang,Wenjun Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwiftVLA introduces an efficient Vision-Language-Action model with 4D reasoning capabilities, using a pretrained 4D vision transformer and novel strategies like Fusion Tokens and mask-and-reconstruct for lightweight and enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the impracticality of large parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the limitations of lightweight models in spatiotemporal reasoning.

Method: The method involves utilizing a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache to extract 4D features, combining them with Vision-Language Models using learnable Fusion Tokens, and employing a mask-and-reconstruct strategy to train the VLM to understand 4D structures while minimizing inference requirements.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that SwiftVLA outperforms other lightweight models and matches the performance of much larger VLAs, achieving significant improvements in speed (18x faster) and memory efficiency (12x lower).

Conclusion: SwiftVLA presents a practical and efficient solution for deploying Vision-Language-Action models on edge devices while maintaining strong performance and spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential but are limited in practicality due to their large parameter counts. To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.

### [268] [The Outline of Deception: Physical Adversarial Attacks on Traffic Signs Using Edge Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00765)
*Haojie Jia,Te Hu,Haowen Li,Long Jin,Chongshi Xin,Yuchi Yao,Jiarui Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TESP-Attack, a stealthy adversarial attack method on traffic signs that avoids visible tampering by aligning perturbations with edge regions and optimizing visual integration. It shows high attack success rates and effective cross-model and real-world robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physical adversarial attack methods on traffic signs are often visually conspicuous, making them detectable by humans and impractical for real-world use. This study aims to address this limitation.

Method: TESP-Attack utilizes instance segmentation to focus perturbations on edge-aligned regions of traffic signs, employing a U-Net generator for creating patches that blend seamlessly with the environment while adhering to constraints on color, texture, and frequency. The approach ensures stealth and effectiveness.

Result: TESP-Attack achieves over 90% attack success across various models while demonstrating strong cross-model transferability and robust real-world performance under varying angles and distances.

Conclusion: TESP-Attack advances adversarial attacks on traffic sign classification with a stealth-aware approach that improves visual concealment and real-world applicability without sacrificing effectiveness against deep learning models.

Abstract: Intelligent driving systems are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs. These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework called EAG3R for robust 3D geometry estimation in challenging scenarios by combining RGB data with event streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing RGB-only approaches in dynamic and low-light scenarios for robust real-world 3D geometry estimation.

Method: The framework incorporates a retinex-inspired image enhancement module, an event adapter with a SNR-aware fusion mechanism, and a novel event-based photometric consistency loss, utilizing both RGB and event streams.

Result: EAG3R achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines in depth estimation, pose tracking, and reconstruction across challenging conditions.

Conclusion: EAG3R effectively integrates event streams with RGB data, providing robust geometry estimation in real-world, dynamic, and low-light environments without additional training on night-time data.

Abstract: Robust 3D geometry estimation from videos is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, SLAM, and 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods like DUSt3R demonstrate that regressing dense pointmaps from image pairs enables accurate and efficient pose-free reconstruction. However, existing RGB-only approaches struggle under real-world conditions involving dynamic objects and extreme illumination, due to the inherent limitations of conventional cameras. In this paper, we propose EAG3R, a novel geometry estimation framework that augments pointmap-based reconstruction with asynchronous event streams. Built upon the MonST3R backbone, EAG3R introduces two key innovations: (1) a retinex-inspired image enhancement module and a lightweight event adapter with SNR-aware fusion mechanism that adaptively combines RGB and event features based on local reliability; and (2) a novel event-based photometric consistency loss that reinforces spatiotemporal coherence during global optimization. Our method enables robust geometry estimation in challenging dynamic low-light scenes without requiring retraining on night-time data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAG3R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-only baselines across monocular depth estimation, camera pose tracking, and dynamic reconstruction tasks.

Result: Achieved high success rates: 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% on Franka real-robot tasks, and 52.38% on RoboTwin2.0, with a 9.25% performance boost from cross-modal learning.

Conclusion: MM-ACT advances the efficiency and capability of robotic systems in handling diverse tasks by integrating text, image, and actions.

Abstract: A generalist robotic policy needs both semantic understanding for task planning and the ability to interact with the environment through predictive capabilities. To tackle this, we present MM-ACT, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates text, image, and action in shared token space and performs generation across all three modalities. MM-ACT adopts a re-mask parallel decoding strategy for text and image generation, and employs a one-step parallel decoding strategy for action generation to improve efficiency. We introduce Context-Shared Multimodal Learning, a unified training paradigm that supervises generation in all three modalities from a shared context, enhancing action generation through cross-modal learning. Experiments were conducted on the LIBERO simulation and Franka real-robot setups as well as RoboTwin2.0 to assess in-domain and out-of-domain performances respectively. Our approach achieves a success rate of 96.3% on LIBERO, 72.0% across three tasks of real Franka, and 52.38% across eight bimanual tasks of RoboTwin2.0 with an additional gain of 9.25% from cross-modal learning.

Motivation: The lack of high-quality, large-scale Japanese Vision-and-Language datasets motivated this work to enhance multimodal model development in Japanese contexts.

Method: A scalable pipeline was developed combining web collection, filtering/deduplication, object-detection evidence extraction, and Large Language Model refinement under grounding constraints.

Result: It produced DEJIMA-Cap and DEJIMA-VQA datasets with 3.88M image-text pairs. These surpass existing datasets in scale while achieving high linguistic naturalness, cultural relevance, and factual accuracy.

Conclusion: DEJIMA datasets improve model performance across Japanese multimodal benchmarks, showcasing the importance of culturally grounded large-scale resources. The dataset and pipeline are public, fostering further research and applications.

Abstract: This work addresses the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale resources for Japanese Vision-and-Language (V&L) modeling. We present a scalable and reproducible pipeline that integrates large-scale web collection with rigorous filtering/deduplication, object-detection-driven evidence extraction, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement under grounding constraints. Using this pipeline, we build two resources: an image-caption dataset (DEJIMA-Cap) and a VQA dataset (DEJIMA-VQA), each containing 3.88M image-text pairs, far exceeding the size of existing Japanese V&L datasets. Human evaluations demonstrate that DEJIMA achieves substantially higher Japaneseness and linguistic naturalness than datasets constructed via translation or manual annotation, while maintaining factual correctness at a level comparable to human-annotated corpora. Quantitative analyses of image feature distributions further confirm that DEJIMA broadly covers diverse visual domains characteristic of Japan, complementing its linguistic and cultural representativeness. Models trained on DEJIMA exhibit consistent improvements across multiple Japanese multimodal benchmarks, confirming that culturally grounded, large-scale resources play a key role in enhancing model performance. All data sources and modules in our pipeline are licensed for commercial use, and we publicly release the resulting dataset and metadata to encourage further research and industrial applications in Japanese V&L modeling.

*Bo Guo,Sijia Wen,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PolarGS, a 3D surface reconstruction method using polarized light to improve accuracy in reflective and textureless surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with photometric ambiguities in reflective and textureless regions, preventing accurate geometry estimation.

Method: Introduces PolarGS with two modules: (1) polarization-guided photometric correction to identify reflective areas and refine them, and (2) polarization-enhanced densification for textureless surfaces using polarization data in depth completion processes.

Result: PolarGS demonstrates superior geometric accuracy when compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Polarization can successfully complement photometric cues in overcoming surface reconstruction challenges, and PolarGS effectively achieves this with improved results.

Abstract: Recent advances in surface reconstruction for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled remarkable geometric accuracy. However, their performance degrades in photometrically ambiguous regions such as reflective and textureless surfaces, where unreliable cues disrupt photometric consistency and hinder accurate geometry estimation. Reflected light is often partially polarized in a manner that reveals surface orientation, making polarization an optic complement to photometric cues in resolving such ambiguities. Therefore, we propose PolarGS, an optics-aware extension of RGB-based 3DGS that leverages polarization as an optical prior to resolve photometric ambiguities and enhance reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce two complementary modules: a polarization-guided photometric correction strategy, which ensures photometric consistency by identifying reflective regions via the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) and refining reflective Gaussians with Color Refinement Maps; and a polarization-enhanced Gaussian densification mechanism for textureless area geometry recovery, which integrates both Angle and Degree of Linear Polarization (A/DoLP) into a PatchMatch-based depth completion process. This enables the back-projection and fusion of new Gaussians, leading to more complete reconstruction. PolarGS is framework-agnostic and achieves superior geometric accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CircleFlow, a framework for accurately estimating the point spread function (PSF) by using flow-guided edge localization and optimizing PSF representation and sharp image reconstruction within a differentiable framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSF estimation is critical for optical characterization and computational vision, yet challenging due to ambiguity and the ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution.

Method: CircleFlow uses structured capture with a circle grid target, binary luminance prior, subpixel optical flow alignment, and implicit neural representation modeling for PSF estimation. Components are jointly optimized within a differentiable framework.

Result: CircleFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability in PSF estimation through extensive tests on simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: CircleFlow provides a robust and accurate solution for practical PSF calibration by leveraging edge localization and optimizing within a differentiable framework.

Abstract: The point spread function (PSF) serves as a fundamental descriptor linking the real-world scene to the captured signal, manifesting as camera blur. Accurate PSF estimation is crucial for both optical characterization and computational vision, yet remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and the ill-posed nature of intensity-based deconvolution. We introduce CircleFlow, a high-fidelity PSF estimation framework that employs flow-guided edge localization for precise blur characterization. CircleFlow begins with a structured capture that encodes locally anisotropic and spatially varying PSFs by imaging a circle grid target, while leveraging the target's binary luminance prior to decouple image and kernel estimation. The latent sharp image is then reconstructed through subpixel alignment of an initialized binary structure guided by optical flow, whereas the PSF is modeled as an energy-constrained implicit neural representation. Both components are jointly optimized within a demosaicing-aware differentiable framework, ensuring physically consistent and robust PSF estimation enabled by accurate edge localization. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that CircleFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and reliability, validating its effectiveness for practical PSF calibration.

### [275] [Generalized Medical Phrase Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01085)
*Wenjun Zhang,Shekhar S. Chandra,Aaron Nicolson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedGrounder, a model for generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), which maps medical phrases to multiple image regions or none as needed, showing strong zero-shot performance and reducing dependence on human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical phrase grounding methods are limited as they assume each phrase corresponds to only one image region, which fails to address multi-region findings, non-groundable phrases, and normal anatomy. This creates a need for a more flexible approach.

Method: The authors propose MedGrounder, which employs a two-stage training process: pre-training on datasets aligning report sentences with anatomy boxes, and fine-tuning with human-annotated datasets. This enables flexible mapping for GMPG and compatibility with existing report generators.

Result: MedGrounder outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation systems on tasks involving multi-region or non-groundable phrases, achieves strong performance in zero-shot transfer scenarios, and operates with significantly fewer human annotations.

Conclusion: MedGrounder establishes a more realistic and flexible framework for medical phrase grounding, improving interpretability of medical reports while being efficient with annotation requirements. It is also compatible with existing systems for generating grounded medical reports.

Abstract: Medical phrase grounding (MPG) maps textual descriptions of radiological findings to corresponding image regions. These grounded reports are easier to interpret, especially for non-experts. Existing MPG systems mostly follow the referring expression comprehension (REC) paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase. Real reports often violate this assumption. They contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases, such as negations or descriptions of normal anatomy. Motivated by this, we reformulate the task as generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), where each sentence is mapped to zero, one, or multiple scored regions. To realise this formulation, we introduce the first GMPG model: MedGrounder. We adopted a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence--anatomy box alignment datasets and fine-tuning on report sentence--human annotated box datasets. Experiments on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR show that MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, while using far fewer human box annotations. Finally, we show that MedGrounder can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining the generator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding demands coherent reasoning over extended temporal contexts, which is challenging due to inefficiencies in current methods that process large multi-modal contexts.

Method: SpecTemp uses a cooperative dual-model design where a draft model quickly suggests key frames, and a target model performs in-depth reasoning and validation. It employs reinforcement learning to enhance efficiency.

Result: SpecTemp demonstrated competitive accuracy while significantly speeding up inference compared to existing methods in video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SpecTemp framework effectively balances computational efficiency and reasoning accuracy, showcasing a novel approach to tackling inefficiencies in long video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding is essential for human-like intelligence, enabling coherent perception and reasoning over extended temporal contexts. While the emerging thinking-with-frames paradigm, which alternates between global temporal reasoning and local frame examination, has advanced the reasoning capabilities of video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), it suffers from a significant efficiency bottleneck due to the progressively growing and redundant multi-modal context. To address this, we propose SpecTemp, a reinforcement learning-based Speculative Temporal reasoning framework that decouples temporal perception from reasoning via a cooperative dual-model design. In SpecTemp, a lightweight draft MLLM rapidly explores and proposes salient frames from densely sampled temporal regions, while a powerful target MLLM focuses on temporal reasoning and verifies the draft's proposals, iteratively refining its attention until convergence. This design mirrors the collaborative pathways of the human brain, balancing efficiency with accuracy. To support training, we construct the SpecTemp-80K dataset, featuring synchronized dual-level annotations for coarse evidence spans and fine-grained frame-level evidence. Experiments across multiple video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SpecTemp not only maintains competitive accuracy but also significantly accelerates inference compared with existing thinking-with-frames methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating simulation-ready articulated 3D assets is currently labor-intensive and requires expert knowledge to model part hierarchies and motion structures.

Method: SPARK uses vision-language models (VLMs) to extract initial parameters, combines part-image guidance in a diffusion transformer, and refines parameters with differentiable techniques for detailed kinematic modeling.

Result: SPARK produces high-quality 3D articulated objects that are physically consistent and ready for simulations, as demonstrated in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework simplifies the creation of 3D articulated objects, proving useful for applications in robotics, manipulation, and interactive modeling.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are critical for embodied AI, robotics, and interactive scene understanding, yet creating simulation-ready assets remains labor-intensive and requires expert modeling of part hierarchies and motion structures. We introduce SPARK, a framework for reconstructing physically consistent, kinematic part-level articulated objects from a single RGB image. Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images. We then integrate the part-image guidance and the inferred structure graph into a generative diffusion transformer to synthesize consistent part and complete shapes of articulated objects. To further refine the URDF parameters, we incorporate differentiable forward kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize joint types, axes, and origins under VLM-generated open-state supervision. Extensive experiments show that SPARK produces high-quality, simulation-ready articulated assets across diverse categories, enabling downstream applications such as robotic manipulation and interaction modeling.

*Haoxuan Xu. Yi Liu,Boyuan Jiang,Jinlong Peng,Donghao Luo,Xiaobin Hu,Shuicheng Yan,Haoang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IRPO, a new post-training paradigm for image restoration, focusing on better data formulation and reward modeling to improve performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing image restoration methods that suffer from over-smoothing and poor generalization due to their reliance on pixel-level hard-fitting.

Method: IRPO introduces a data formulation principle that selects underperforming samples for improved efficiency and performance. It also employs a reward criteria system balancing structural accuracy and perceptual quality using three components: General Reward, Expert Reward, and Restoration Reward.

Result: IRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on six in-domain and five OOD low-level benchmarks, surpassing AdaIR by 0.83 dB and 3.43 dB, respectively.

Conclusion: IRPO effectively enhances low-level image restoration with systematic improvements in data formulation and reward modeling, showing promising results across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training paradigms have achieved remarkable success in high-level generation tasks, yet their potential for low-level vision remains rarely explored. Existing image restoration (IR) methods rely on pixel-level hard-fitting to ground-truth images, struggling with over-smoothing and poor generalization. To address these limitations, we propose IRPO, a low-level GRPO-based post-training paradigm that systematically explores both data formulation and reward modeling. We first explore a data formulation principle for low-level post-training paradigm, in which selecting underperforming samples from the pre-training stage yields optimal performance and improved efficiency. Furthermore, we model a reward-level criteria system that balances objective accuracy and human perceptual preference through three complementary components: a General Reward for structural fidelity, an Expert Reward leveraging Qwen-VL for perceptual alignment, and a Restoration Reward for task-specific low-level quality. Comprehensive experiments on six in-domain and five out-of-domain (OOD) low-level benchmarks demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse degradation types, surpassing the AdaIR baseline by 0.83 dB on in-domain tasks and 3.43 dB on OOD settings.

*Yue Pan,Tao Sun,Liyuan Zhu,Lucas Nunes,Iro Armeni,Jens Behley,Cyrill Stachniss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel methodology for point cloud registration by treating it as conditional generation, directly producing registered point clouds rather than relying on pairwise transformation matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud registration is crucial for 3D reconstruction and robot localization, especially for scenarios involving low overlap, diverse scales, and sensor modalities.

Method: The proposed approach employs a learned continuous, point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points to a registered scene directly, utilizing a lightweight local feature extractor and enforcing rigidity constraints during test time.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for pairwise and multi-view registration, with strong capabilities in low overlap conditions and robustness across different scales and sensor modalities.

Conclusion: This innovative technique advances multi-view registration by bypassing traditional pairwise correspondence matching, demonstrating utility in varied robotic tasks and offering generalization for diverse applications.

Abstract: Point cloud registration aligns multiple unposed point clouds into a common frame, and is a core step for 3D reconstruction and robot localization. In this work, we cast registration as conditional generation: a learned continuous, point-wise velocity field transports noisy points to a registered scene, from which the pose of each view is recovered. Unlike previous methods that conduct correspondence matching to estimate the transformation between a pair of point clouds and then optimize the pairwise transformations to realize multi-view registration, our model directly generates the registered point cloud. With a lightweight local feature extractor and test-time rigidity enforcement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on pairwise and multi-view registration benchmarks, particularly with low overlap, and generalizes across scales and sensor modalities. It further supports downstream tasks including relocalization, multi-robot SLAM, and multi-session map merging. Source code available at: https://github.com/PRBonn/RAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps in motion control and visual quality in panoramic video generation for applications in VR and immersive media.

Method: PanFlow employs spherical noise warping for loop consistency and decouples camera rotation from optical flow conditions, supported by a curated dataset with pose and flow annotations.

Result: PanFlow outperforms previous methods in motion fidelity, quality, and coherence through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: PanFlow enhances panoramic video generation capabilities, with its methodology and resources publicly available for contribution and experimentation.

Abstract: Panoramic video generation has attracted growing attention due to its applications in virtual reality and immersive media. However, existing methods lack explicit motion control and struggle to generate scenes with large and complex motions. We propose PanFlow, a novel approach that exploits the spherical nature of panoramas to decouple the highly dynamic camera rotation from the input optical flow condition, enabling more precise control over large and dynamic motions. We further introduce a spherical noise warping strategy to promote loop consistency in motion across panorama boundaries. To support effective training, we curate a large-scale, motion-rich panoramic video dataset with frame-level pose and flow annotations. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method in various applications, including motion transfer and video editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanFlow significantly outperforms prior methods in motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLWG, a post-training self-supervised alignment framework, which integrates physically grounded rewards into pretrained world models. It demonstrates improvements in visual and spatial coherence for navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale generative video world models lack geometric and spatial grounding, which limits their usefulness for navigation tasks requiring reliable long-horizon stability.

Method: The authors propose RLWG, a self-supervised post-training framework using geometric and perceptual rewards for alignment. They implement GrndCtrl, which incorporates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to stabilize trajectories and consistent geometry.

Result: GrndCtrl shows significant improvement in maintaining stable trajectories and spatial coherence when compared with supervised fine-tuning, particularly in outdoor navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating physically verifiable feedback into generative world models enhances navigation performance, offering a parallel to alignment practices in language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.

*Zirui Zhao,Boye Niu,David Hsu,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to generate abstract visual compositions using geometric constraints and neural semantics, outperforming existing generative models in constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of generating abstract structures that rely on spatial configuration and relations among geometric primitives, overcoming issues like sparse solution manifolds and combinatorial complexity.

Method: The method combines geometric reasoning with neural semantics, utilizing an AlphaGo-like search for feasibility and a vision-language model for semantic scoring. It fine-tunes the network via Monte-Carlo Tree Search and adversarial reward refinement inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance in terms of validity and semantic fidelity in the Tangram Assembly task compared to diffusion and auto-regressive models, particularly under tight constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach efficiently integrates geometric constraints and neural models to generate semantically aligned and feasible abstract compositions, proving effective in challenging environments.

Abstract: We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AFRAgent, a compact multimodal architecture improving mobile GUI automation through adaptive feature processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile UI automation is increasingly demanded for its wide-ranging applications, but existing methods face challenges like inaccurate widget identification, action determination, and inference delays in large models.

Method: The authors developed AFRAgent, a multimodal architecture based on instruct-BLIP, incorporating adaptive feature renormalization to enrich image embeddings and improve fusion of high-resolution details.

Result: AFRAgent outperforms competitors on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks while being under one-fourth the size of its closest rival, setting a new standard for smartphone GUI automation.

Conclusion: The proposed AFRAgent offers a significant contribution to UI automation by providing a compact, efficient, and high-performing solution for smartphone automation.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for mobile user interface (UI) automation, driven by its broad applications across industries. With the advent of visual language models (VLMs), GUI automation has progressed from generating text-based instructions for humans to autonomously executing tasks, thus optimizing automation workflows. Recent approaches leverage VLMs for this problem due to their ability to 1) process on-screen content directly, 2) remain independent of device-specific APIs by utilizing human actions (e.g., clicks, typing), and 3) apply real-world contextual knowledge for task understanding. However, these models often have trouble accurately identifying widgets and determining actions due to limited spatial information in vision encoder features. Additionally, top-performing models are often large, requiring extensive training and resulting in inference delays. In this work, we introduce AFRAgent, an instruct-BLIP-based multimodal architecture that achieves superior performance in GUI automation while being less than one-fourth the size of its nearest competitor. To enhance image embeddings in the large language model (LLM) pipeline, we propose an adaptive feature renormalization-based (a token-level affine transformation) technique that effectively enriches low-resolution image embeddings and fuses high-resolution details. We evaluate AFRAgent on Meta-GUI and AITW benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art baseline for smartphone automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient yet flexible methods to compress and represent 3D scenes with both spatial and semantic fidelity.

Method: The method uses recursive voxel hierarchies for spatial representation and splat-wise features for semantic information, enabling high compression rates without sacrificing rendering quality.

Result: Smol-GS significantly compresses 3D scenes while maintaining state-of-the-art rendering quality on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Smol-GS not only excels in compact representation and visual fidelity but has potential applications in downstream tasks like navigation and scene understanding.

Abstract: We present Smol-GS, a novel method for learning compact representations for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach learns highly efficient encodings in 3D space that integrate both spatial and semantic information. The model captures the coordinates of the splats through a recursive voxel hierarchy, while splat-wise features store abstracted cues, including color, opacity, transformation, and material properties. This design allows the model to compress 3D scenes by orders of magnitude without loss of flexibility. Smol-GS achieves state-of-the-art compression on standard benchmarks while maintaining high rendering quality. Beyond visual fidelity, the discrete representations could potentially serve as a foundation for downstream tasks such as navigation, planning, and broader 3D scene understanding.

TL;DR: VisualSync is an optimization framework that synchronizes unsynchronized, unposed videos at millisecond precision using epipolar constraints and multi-view dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of synchronizing cross-camera video streams in uncontrolled and diverse settings, without relying on expensive hardware or manual corrections.

Method: The method utilizes 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences, followed by joint optimization to minimize epipolar error and estimate camera time offsets.

Result: VisualSync demonstrated superior performance on four diverse datasets, achieving a median synchronization error under 50 milliseconds, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: VisualSync provides a robust and efficient solution for video synchronization in uncontrolled environments, proving its utility in real-world applications by achieving high synchronization accuracy.

Abstract: Today, people can easily record memorable moments, ranging from concerts, sports events, lectures, family gatherings, and birthday parties with multiple consumer cameras. However, synchronizing these cross-camera streams remains challenging. Existing methods assume controlled settings, specific targets, manual correction, or costly hardware. We present VisualSync, an optimization framework based on multi-view dynamics that aligns unposed, unsynchronized videos at millisecond accuracy. Our key insight is that any moving 3D point, when co-visible in two cameras, obeys epipolar constraints once properly synchronized. To exploit this, VisualSync leverages off-the-shelf 3D reconstruction, feature matching, and dense tracking to extract tracklets, relative poses, and cross-view correspondences. It then jointly minimizes the epipolar error to estimate each camera's time offset. Experiments on four diverse, challenging datasets show that VisualSync outperforms baseline methods, achieving an median synchronization error below 50 ms.

Motivation: Current foundation models in the medical domain often require extensive fine-tuning and are pretrained with objectives biased toward specific tasks. There is a need for scalable, task-agnostic models that perform effectively with minimal tuning.

Method: The method, TAP-CT, adapts Vision Transformers and DINOv2 for 3D CT data by modifying patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations to make them depth-aware while simplifying the architectures.

Result: The pretraining approach on a large dataset (105K CT volumes) produced robust frozen representations that generalize well across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: TAP-CT provides scalable, task-agnostic, and effective pretraining for CT models, facilitating further research and development in medical imaging. Pretrained models and configurations will be publicly released for transparency and reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing foundation models (FMs) in the medical domain often require extensive fine-tuning or rely on training resource-intensive decoders, while many existing encoders are pretrained with objectives biased toward specific tasks. This illustrates a need for a strong, task-agnostic foundation model that requires minimal fine-tuning beyond feature extraction. In this work, we introduce a suite of task-agnostic pretraining of CT foundation models (TAP-CT): a simple yet effective adaptation of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and DINOv2 for volumetric data, enabling scalable self-supervised pretraining directly on 3D CT volumes. Our approach incorporates targeted modifications to patch embeddings, positional encodings, and volumetric augmentations, making the architecture depth-aware while preserving the simplicity of the underlying architectures. We show that large-scale 3D pretraining on an extensive in-house CT dataset (105K volumes) yields stable, robust frozen representations that generalize strongly across downstream tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to tackle data scarcity issues in self-driving laboratories by developing a hybrid pipeline combining real and virtual data generation for enhanced pipetting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address labor-intensive, time-consuming, and irreproducible workflows in biological sciences, which require robust training models hindered by scarce annotated data, especially for rare negative samples.

Method: The method involves creating a hybrid data generation pipeline: a real data track using a human-in-the-loop approach for precise validation, and a virtual data track leveraging prompt-guided image generation and validation, to ensure dataset balance.

Result: By combining real and virtual data, the training model achieves 99.6% accuracy using real images alone, and 99.4% accuracy with mixed real and generated data, reducing data collection workload while maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable, efficient solution to data scarcity in self-driving laboratory workflows, particularly in rare event detection cases, enhancing accuracy and reducing manual effort.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories offer a promising path toward reducing the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often irreproducible workflows in the biological sciences. Yet their stringent precision requirements demand highly robust models whose training relies on large amounts of annotated data. However, this kind of data is difficult to obtain in routine practice, especially negative samples. In this work, we focus on pipetting, the most critical and precision sensitive action in SDLs. To overcome the scarcity of training data, we build a hybrid pipeline that fuses real and virtual data generation. The real track adopts a human-in-the-loop scheme that couples automated acquisition with selective human verification to maximize accuracy with minimal effort. The virtual track augments the real data using reference-conditioned, prompt-guided image generation, which is further screened and validated for reliability. Together, these two tracks yield a class-balanced dataset that enables robust bubble detection training. On a held-out real test set, a model trained entirely on automatically acquired real images reaches 99.6% accuracy, and mixing real and generated data during training sustains 99.4% accuracy while reducing collection and review load. Our approach offers a scalable and cost-effective strategy for supplying visual feedback data to SDL workflows and provides a practical solution to data scarcity in rare event detection and broader vision tasks.

TL;DR: The study introduces DeepPriorCBCT, a deep learning framework for CBCT-guided procedures, that uses only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose while providing diagnostic-grade image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiation exposure from CBCT-guided procedures increases the risk of secondary malignancies. Current low-dose CBCT strategies lack validation with large multicenter datasets and prospective clinical trials.

Method: DeepPriorCBCT, a three-stage deep learning model, was developed using a dataset of 8675 CBCT scans from 4102 patients across 12 centers. Its clinical applicability was assessed in a prospective crossover trial involving 138 patients and evaluations by multiple physicians.

Result: DeepPriorCBCT-reconstructed images were comparable to conventional methods in diagnostic performance and image quality, with physicians finding no significant differences. Radiation dose was reduced to one-sixth of the standard approach.

Conclusion: DeepPriorCBCT enables effective and high-quality CBCT imaging at significantly reduced radiation doses, minimizing intraoperative radiation risks while maintaining clinical standards for image utility.

Abstract: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided puncture has become an established approach for diagnosing and treating early- to mid-stage thoracic tumours, yet the associated radiation exposure substantially elevates the risk of secondary malignancies. Although multiple low-dose CBCT strategies have been introduced, none have undergone validation using large-scale multicenter retrospective datasets, and prospective clinical evaluation remains lacking. Here, we propose DeepPriorCBCT - a three-stage deep learning framework that achieves diagnostic-grade reconstruction using only one-sixth of the conventional radiation dose. 4102 patients with 8675 CBCT scans from 12 centers were included to develop and validate DeepPriorCBCT. Additionally, a prospective cross-over trial (Registry number: NCT07035977) which recruited 138 patients scheduled for percutaneous thoracic puncture was conducted to assess the model's clinical applicability. Assessment by 11 physicians confirmed that reconstructed images were indistinguishable from original scans. Moreover, diagnostic performance and overall image quality were comparable to those generated by standard reconstruction algorithms. In the prospective trial, five radiologists reported no significant differences in image quality or lesion assessment between DeepPriorCBCT and the clinical standard (all P>0.05). Likewise, 25 interventionalists expressed no preference between model-based and full-sampling images for surgical guidance (Kappa<0.2). Radiation exposure with DeepPriorCBCT was reduced to approximately one-sixth of that with the conventional approach, and collectively, the findings confirm that it enables high-quality CBCT reconstruction under sparse sampling conditions while markedly decreasing intraoperative radiation risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to overcome the substantial data size of 3D Gaussian Splatting, which hinders its widespread adoption, by developing an effective and generalizable compression method.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a large-scale context structure based on Morton serialization, a fine-grained space-channel auto-regressive entropy model for better context utilization, and an attention-based transform coding model to improve latent priors through feature aggregation.

Result: The method achieves a 20x compression ratio for 3D Gaussian Splatting with state-of-the-art performance among generalizable codecs.

Conclusion: The approach provides a highly effective and generalizable solution to compress 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing key limitations of existing methods and enabling broader applicability of the representation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a revolutionary 3D representation. However, its substantial data size poses a major barrier to widespread adoption. While feed-forward 3DGS compression offers a practical alternative to costly per-scene per-train compressors, existing methods struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies, due to the limited receptive field of transform coding networks and the inadequate context capacity in entropy models. In this work, we propose a novel feed-forward 3DGS compression framework that effectively models long-range correlations to enable highly compact and generalizable 3D representations. Central to our approach is a large-scale context structure that comprises thousands of Gaussians based on Morton serialization. We then design a fine-grained space-channel auto-regressive entropy model to fully leverage this expansive context. Furthermore, we develop an attention-based transform coding model to extract informative latent priors by aggregating features from a wide range of neighboring Gaussians. Our method yields a $20\times$ compression ratio for 3DGS in a feed-forward inference and achieves state-of-the-art performance among generalizable codecs.

Motivation: The research is motivated by the inefficiencies in multimodal intelligence, including feature heterogeneity, real-time operation demands, and redundant operators on resource-constrained domestic hardware.

Method: The paper introduces a geometric framework for neural operators, employing the normalized singular value spectrum on the Bloch hypersphere to establish a cross-modal substitutability metric.

Result: The proposed Quantum Metric-Driven Functional Redundancy Graphs (QM-FRG) and a one-shot structured pruning approach are validated through controlled experiments, demonstrating strong performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The work offers rigorous theoretical and practical solutions for efficient multimodal intelligence, paving the way for hardware-aware optimization and operator substitutability.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal intelligence on resource-constrained and heterogeneous domestic hardware exposes critical bottlenecks: multimodal feature heterogeneity, real-time requirements in dynamic scenarios, and hardware-specific operator redundancy. This work introduces a quantum-inspired geometric framework for neural operators that represents each operator by its normalized singular value spectrum on the Bloch hypersphere. We prove a tight spectral-to-functional equivalence theorem showing that vanishing Fubini--Study/Wasserstein-2 distance implies provable functional closeness, establishing the first rigorous foundation for cross-modal and cross-architecture operator substitutability. Based on this metric, we propose Quantum Metric-Driven Functional Redundancy Graphs (QM-FRG) and one-shot structured pruning. Controlled simulation validates the superiority of the proposed metric over magnitude and random baselines. An extensive experimental validation on large-scale multimodal transformers and domestic heterogeneous hardware (Huawei Ascend, Cambricon MLU, Kunlunxin) hardware is deferred to an extended journal version currently in preparation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces hallucinations and boosts accuracy in domain-specific applications, transforming perception into active knowledge retrieval through modular design.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit significant performance plateaus in specialized domains like precision agriculture, primarily due to "Reasoning-Driven Hallucination" where linguistic priors override visual perception. A key bottleneck is the "Modality Gap": visual embeddings fail to reliably activate the fine-grained expert knowledge already encoded in model parameters. We propose "Look, Recite, Then Answer," a parameter-efficient framework that enhances VLMs via self-generated knowledge hints while keeping backbone models frozen. The framework decouples inference into three stages: (1) Look generates objective visual descriptions and candidate sets; (2) Recite employs a lightweight 1.7B router to transform visual cues into targeted queries that trigger candidate-specific parametric knowledge; (3) Answer performs parallel evidence alignment between descriptions and recited knowledge to select the most consistent label. On AgroBench, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving Weed Identification accuracy by 23.6% over Qwen-VL and surpassing GPT-4o without external search overhead. This modular design mitigates hallucinations by transforming passive perception into active, controllable knowledge retrieval

*Masatoshi Tateno,Gido Kato,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Yoichi Sato,Takuma Yagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark focusing on hand-object interactions (HOI) by addressing manipulation and effect dynamics. It evaluates models' reasoning on spatial, motion, and part-level understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing HOI benchmarks, which lack the capabilities for fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning required to capture dynamic aspects of human-object interactions.

Method: The study introduces HanDyVQA, a benchmark covering six question types related to HOI, compiling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs and 10.3K segmentation masks. It measures video foundation models' performance in understanding manipulation and effects through various tasks.

Result: The best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieved only 73% accuracy, far lower than human performance (97%). This highlights challenges like spatial relationships, motion understanding, and part-level reasoning.

Conclusion: Explicitly integrating HOI-related cues into models improves performance and demonstrates the need for advancements in modeling HOI dynamics to bridge the performance gap with humans.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) inherently involves dynamics where human manipulations produce distinct spatio-temporal effects on objects. However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.

*Carlos Rebelo,Gil Rocha,João Daniel Silva,Bruno Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a training-free multilingual approach for remote sensing image captioning using retrieval-augmented prompting, demonstrating competitive results across languages and proposing methods like PageRank re-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from overcoming challenges like the reliance on large annotated datasets and the predominance of English-focused studies in remote sensing image captioning.

Method: The method leverages a domain-adapted encoder (SigLIP2) to retrieve captions and few-shot examples for language models. It introduces two setups: an image-blind approach using multilingual LLMs and an image-aware approach using Vision--Language Models, along with a graph-based re-ranking strategy utilizing PageRank.

Result: The approach achieves competitive results across ten languages and four datasets compared to English-only systems, with re-ranking offering significant performance improvements and VLMs and LLMs showing distinct strengths in caption generation.

Conclusion: This study pioneers a training-free multilingual captioning framework for remote sensing, highlighting the advantages of direct captioning over translation-based strategies and contributing to scalable, inclusive Earth observation systems.

Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning has advanced rapidly through encoder--decoder models, although the reliance on large annotated datasets and the focus on English restricts global applicability. To address these limitations, we propose the first training-free multilingual approach, based on retrieval-augmented prompting. For a given aerial image, we employ a domain-adapted SigLIP2 encoder to retrieve related captions and few-shot examples from a datastore, which are then provided to a language model. We explore two variants: an image-blind setup, where a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) generates the caption from textual prompts alone, and an image-aware setup, where a Vision--Language Model (VLM) jointly processes the prompt and the input image. To improve the coherence of the retrieved content, we introduce a graph-based re-ranking strategy using PageRank on a graph of images and captions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets across ten languages demonstrate that our approach is competitive with fully supervised English-only systems and generalizes to other languages. Results also highlight the importance of re-ranking with PageRank, yielding up to 35% improvements in performance metrics. Additionally, it was observed that while VLMs tend to generate visually grounded but lexically diverse captions, LLMs can achieve stronger BLEU and CIDEr scores. Lastly, directly generating captions in the target language consistently outperforms other translation-based strategies. Overall, our work delivers one of the first systematic evaluations of multilingual, training-free captioning for remote sensing imagery, advancing toward more inclusive and scalable multimodal Earth observation systems.

*Yiyu Wang,Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Xinying Lin,Boxue Yang,Chenfei Liao,Tailai Chen,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a plug-and-play framework called Streaming Token Compression (STC) to address computational inefficiencies in VideoLLMs, optimizing Vision Transformer encoding and reducing memory and latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs struggle with real-time deployment due to high computational costs associated with processing continuous video streams, especially redundant processing in Vision Transformer encoding and inflated token sequences.

Method: The paper proposes STC, consisting of STC-Cacher for reducing ViT encoding overhead and STC-Pruner for compressing visual token sequences before they reach the LLM, focusing on spatial and temporal relevance.

Result: STC achieves 99% model accuracy retention while reducing ViT encoding latency by 24.5% and LLM pre-filling latency by 45.3%, performing better than other compression methods in experiments across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: STC is an effective and efficient framework for optimizing streaming VideoLLMs, significantly improving latency and maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: Streaming Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various video understanding tasks, but they face significant challenges in real-time deployment due to the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens from continuous video streams. In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreamGaze, the first benchmark to evaluate how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) use gaze signals for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos, revealing performance gaps against human-level understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance streaming video understanding by incorporating gaze-guided reasoning, addressing the lack of existing benchmarks that evaluate human gaze interpretation in MLLMs for practical applications like AR glasses.

Method: The authors created StreamGaze, a benchmark featuring gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks, using a pipeline that combines egocentric videos with gaze trajectories to develop spatio-temporally grounded question-answer pairs.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs show significant deficiencies compared to human performance on StreamGaze tasks, particularly in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction.

Conclusion: StreamGaze reveals critical limitations in current MLLMs for gaze-guided video understanding, guiding future research to improve gaze integration. The data/code will be released for further exploration in this domain.

Abstract: Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.

*Xingyu Zhu,Beier Zhu,Yunfan Li,Junfeng Fang,Shuo Wang,Kesen Zhao,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved training-free method for image clustering named CAE, utilizing hierarchical semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image clustering methods using nouns ignore noun ambiguity, affecting semantic representation and clustering quality.

Method: The proposed CAE method aligns image features with hierarchical semantics from captions and nouns using optimal transport without training.

Result: The CAE achieved significant improvements in clustering accuracy and ARI on multiple datasets, notably surpassing other training-free methods.

Conclusion: CAE effectively addresses noun ambiguity and enhances clustering results through hierarchical semantic alignment.

Abstract: Image clustering is a classic problem in computer vision, which categorizes images into different groups. Recent studies utilize nouns as external semantic knowledge to improve clus- tering performance. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of nouns, which can distort semantic representations and degrade clustering quality. To address this issue, we propose a hierarChical semAntic alignmEnt method for image clustering, dubbed CAE, which improves cluster- ing performance in a training-free manner. In our approach, we incorporate two complementary types of textual seman- tics: caption-level descriptions, which convey fine-grained attributes of image content, and noun-level concepts, which represent high-level object categories. We first select relevant nouns from WordNet and descriptions from caption datasets to construct a semantic space aligned with image features. Then, we align image features with selected nouns and captions via optimal transport to obtain a more discriminative semantic space. Finally, we combine the enhanced semantic and image features to perform clustering. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, notably surpassing the state-of-the-art training-free approach with a 4.2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.9% improvement in adjusted rand index (ARI) on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TalkingPose, a diffusion-based framework for generating long-form, temporally consistent upper-body animations from a single image and driving poses, overcoming limitations of existing short-segment-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inability of current diffusion models to generate temporally coherent and extended animations due to computational and memory constraints when trained on short video segments.

Method: TalkingPose uses a stable diffusion backbone with a feedback-driven mechanism for temporal coherence. It leverages driving frames to transfer facial and hand movements effectively without additional computational costs or retraining.

Result: The framework enables the generation of high-quality, unlimited-duration animations with upper-body movements, along with the development of a new large-scale dataset for benchmarking.

Conclusion: TalkingPose proves effective in overcoming the short-frame limitations of existing methods, achieving temporally coherent animations and offering a robust tool for long-form content creation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved the realism and generalizability of character-driven animation, enabling the synthesis of high-quality motion from just a single RGB image and a set of driving poses. Nevertheless, generating temporally coherent long-form content remains challenging. Existing approaches are constrained by computational and memory limitations, as they are typically trained on short video segments, thus performing effectively only over limited frame lengths and hindering their potential for extended coherent generation. To address these constraints, we propose TalkingPose, a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for producing long-form, temporally consistent human upper-body animations. TalkingPose leverages driving frames to precisely capture expressive facial and hand movements, transferring these seamlessly to a target actor through a stable diffusion backbone. To ensure continuous motion and enhance temporal coherence, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism built upon image-based diffusion models. Notably, this mechanism does not incur additional computational costs or require secondary training stages, enabling the generation of animations with unlimited duration. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive, large-scale dataset to serve as a new benchmark for human upper-body animation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges caused by non-upright panoramas created from unstable robot postures. Traditional IMU-based methods are prone to drift and disturbances, which hinder performance in robotic vision tasks.

Method: The method involves a dual-stream network combining a CNN branch for geometric structure extraction, a ViT branch for global contextual understanding, and a dual-projection adaptive fusion module. Additional enhancements include high-frequency enhancement, circular padding, and channel attention mechanisms.

Result: The proposed network surpasses current methods in inclination angle estimation and upright panorama generation, as demonstrated on SUN360 and M3D datasets.

Conclusion: This study offers an effective joint solution to inclination angle estimation and upright panorama reconstruction, validated by superior performance and ablation studies.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capable of capturing a 360-degree field of view, are crucial in robotic vision, particularly in environments with sparse features. However, non-upright panoramas due to unstable robot postures hinder downstream tasks. Traditional IMU-based correction methods suffer from drift and external disturbances, while vision-based approaches offer a promising alternative. This study presents a dual-stream angle-aware generation network that jointly estimates camera inclination angles and reconstructs upright panoramic images. The network comprises a CNN branch that extracts local geometric structures from equirectangular projections and a ViT branch that captures global contextual cues from cubemap projections. These are integrated through a dual-projection adaptive fusion module that aligns spatial features across both domains. To further enhance performance, we introduce a high-frequency enhancement block, circular padding, and channel attention mechanisms to preserve 360° continuity and improve geometric sensitivity. Experiments on the SUN360 and M3D datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both inclination estimation and upright panorama generation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each module and highlight the synergy between the two tasks.

*Wentao Qu,Xiaoshui Huang,Liang Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LAHNet, a method using local attention mechanisms and transformers to improve point cloud registration with broader receptive fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance feature distinctiveness in point cloud registration by incorporating broader receptive fields and local attention mechanisms.

Method: LAHNet utilizes Locality-Sensitive Hashing for partitioning point clouds, a Group Transformer for capturing context, and an Interaction Transformer for enhancing overlap region interactions.

Result: Experiments confirm LAHNet’s ability to achieve robust, distinctive features yielding superior registration performance in real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: LAHNet effectively broadens the receptive field via innovative windowing and transformer strategies, improving point cloud registration significantly.

Abstract: Most existing learning-based point cloud descriptors for point cloud registration focus on perceiving local information of point clouds to generate distinctive features. However, a reasonable and broader receptive field is essential for enhancing feature distinctiveness. In this paper, we propose a Local Attentive Hashing Network for point cloud registration, called LAHNet, which introduces a local attention mechanism with the inductive bias of locality of convolution-like operators into point cloud descriptors. Specifically, a Group Transformer is designed to capture reasonable long-range context between points. This employs a linear neighborhood search strategy, Locality-Sensitive Hashing, enabling uniformly partitioning point clouds into non-overlapping windows. Meanwhile, an efficient cross-window strategy is adopted to further expand the reasonable feature receptive field. Furthermore, building on this effective windowing strategy, we propose an Interaction Transformer to enhance the feature interactions of the overlap regions within point cloud pairs. This computes an overlap matrix to match overlap regions between point cloud pairs by representing each window as a global signal. Extensive results demonstrate that LAHNet can learn robust and distinctive features, achieving significant registration results on real-world indoor and outdoor benchmarks.

*Keita Otani,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SceneProp, a new method for scene-graph grounding via MAP inference in MRFs, outperforming prior work and excelling with increasing query complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phrase grounding struggles to parse intricate relational descriptions in visual queries due to lack of structural bias. Scene-graph grounding offers potential but underutilized solutions despite challenges with complex graph queries.

Method: The proposed SceneProp method reformulates scene-graph grounding as a MAP inference problem in MRFs, using a differentiable Belief Propagation algorithm for global inference over query graphs in an end-to-end framework.

Result: SceneProp significantly outperforms prior approaches in four benchmarks, showing improved accuracy as the size and complexity of query graphs increase.

Conclusion: SceneProp demonstrates that leveraging relational context in scene-graph grounding enables improved performance, showing potential for structured vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Grounding complex, compositional visual queries with multiple objects and relationships is a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. While standard phrase grounding methods excel at localizing single objects, they lack the structural inductive bias to parse intricate relational descriptions, often failing as queries become more descriptive. To address this structural deficit, we focus on scene-graph grounding, a powerful but less-explored formulation where the query is an explicit graph of objects and their relationships. However, existing methods for this task also struggle, paradoxically showing decreased performance as the query graph grows -- failing to leverage the very information that should make grounding easier. We introduce SceneProp, a novel method that resolves this issue by reformulating scene-graph grounding as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem in a Markov Random Field (MRF). By performing global inference over the entire query graph, SceneProp finds the optimal assignment of image regions to nodes that jointly satisfies all constraints. This is achieved within an end-to-end framework via a differentiable implementation of the Belief Propagation algorithm. Experiments on four benchmarks show that our dedicated focus on the scene-graph grounding formulation allows SceneProp to significantly outperform prior work. Critically, its accuracy consistently improves with the size and complexity of the query graph, demonstrating for the first time that more relational context can, and should, lead to better grounding.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve memory efficiency and segmentation performance in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-GS-based segmentation methods suffer from high memory consumption due to high-dimensional category features and face challenges with fine-grained segmentation from label space congestion and lack of granularity control.

Method: The authors propose a coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme for per-Gaussian category representation, a progressive training strategy for decomposing segmentation tasks, and opacity fine-tuning for better foreground-background distinction.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, significantly reduces memory utilization, and speeds up inference on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach addresses key challenges in 3D-GS-based segmentation, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency for semantic tasks while minimizing memory overhead.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as an efficient 3D representation and a promising foundation for semantic tasks like segmentation. However, existing 3D-GS-based segmentation methods typically rely on high-dimensional category features, which introduce substantial memory overhead. Moreover, fine-grained segmentation remains challenging due to label space congestion and the lack of stable multi-granularity control mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine binary encoding scheme for per-Gaussian category representation, which compresses each feature into a single integer via the binary-to-decimal mapping, drastically reducing memory usage. We further design a progressive training strategy that decomposes panoptic segmentation into a series of independent sub-tasks, reducing inter-class conflicts and thereby enhancing fine-grained segmentation capability. Additionally, we fine-tune opacity during segmentation training to address the incompatibility between photometric rendering and semantic segmentation, which often leads to foreground-background confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing memory consumption and accelerating inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework, DEMR, to improve moment retrieval in videos using natural language queries by addressing issues of uncertainty estimation and modality imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of accurately identifying video segments based on language, which traditional methods struggle with due to fine-grained information requirements and difficulties in aligning with complex scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes DEMR, featuring a Reflective Flipped Fusion block for cross-modal alignment and a query reconstruction task to enhance sensitivity to text, along with a Geom-regularizer for better uncertainty predictions.

Result: The proposed DEMR framework shows significant improvements in retrieval accuracy, robustness, and interpretability when tested on both standard and debiased datasets like ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD.

Conclusion: DEMR provides a promising solution for improving temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval, effectively addressing issues with uncertainty and modality imbalance.

Abstract: In the domain of moment retrieval, accurately identifying temporal segments within videos based on natural language queries remains challenging. Traditional methods often employ pre-trained models that struggle with fine-grained information and deterministic reasoning, leading to difficulties in aligning with complex or ambiguous moments. To overcome these limitations, we explore Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to construct a vanilla Evidential baseline. However, this approach encounters two major issues: the inability to effectively handle modality imbalance and the structural differences in DER's heuristic uncertainty regularizer, which adversely affect uncertainty estimation. This misalignment results in high uncertainty being incorrectly associated with accurate samples rather than challenging ones. Our observations indicate that existing methods lack the adaptability required for complex video scenarios. In response, we propose Debiased Evidential Learning for Moment Retrieval (DEMR), a novel framework that incorporates a Reflective Flipped Fusion (RFF) block for cross-modal alignment and a query reconstruction task to enhance text sensitivity, thereby reducing bias in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, we introduce a Geom-regularizer to refine uncertainty predictions, enabling adaptive alignment with difficult moments and improving retrieval accuracy. Extensive testing on standard datasets and debiased datasets ActivityNet-CD and Charades-CD demonstrates significant enhancements in effectiveness, robustness, and interpretability, positioning our approach as a promising solution for temporal-semantic robustness in moment retrieval.

Result: The framework enables RL-based agents to imitate reconstructed motions, showing the practical value of the dataset. It also highlights the limitations of existing 3D foundation models in predicting human-object contact correspondences, emphasizing the need for the human-in-the-loop approach.

Conclusion: 4DHOISolver and Open4DHOI bring significant advancements in extracting and utilizing 4D HOI data from in-the-wild videos for robotics. However, automatic precise prediction of contact correspondences remains a major challenge for the community.

Abstract: Generalized robots must learn from diverse, large-scale human-object interactions (HOI) to operate robustly in the real world. Monocular internet videos offer a nearly limitless and readily available source of data, capturing an unparalleled diversity of human activities, objects, and environments. However, accurately and scalably extracting 4D interaction data from these in-the-wild videos remains a significant and unsolved challenge. Thus, in this work, we introduce 4DHOISolver, a novel and efficient optimization framework that constrains the ill-posed 4D HOI reconstruction problem by leveraging sparse, human-in-the-loop contact point annotations, while maintaining high spatio-temporal coherence and physical plausibility. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Open4DHOI, a new large-scale 4D HOI dataset featuring a diverse catalog of 144 object types and 103 actions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstructions by enabling an RL-based agent to imitate the recovered motions. However, a comprehensive benchmark of existing 3D foundation models indicates that automatically predicting precise human-object contact correspondences remains an unsolved problem, underscoring the immediate necessity of our human-in-the-loop strategy while posing an open challenge to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhotoFramer, a framework for improving photo composition, provides natural language instructions and generates example images to guide users. It uses a novel dataset generation method and demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing image composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help casual users improve their photo composition by providing actionable guidance, as many struggle with framing well-composed images.

Method: The PhotoFramer framework trains on a hierarchically structured dataset of composition sub-tasks (shift, zoom-in, and view-change) derived from multi-view datasets and synthesized using a degradation model. It integrates textual and visual output for guidance.

Result: The study shows that textual guidance combined with example images significantly improves photo composition compared to exemplar-only methods.

Conclusion: PhotoFramer makes expert photographic knowledge accessible, demonstrating a practical step toward tools designed to assist users in creating better-composed photos.

Abstract: Composition matters during the photo-taking process, yet many casual users struggle to frame well-composed images. To provide composition guidance, we introduce PhotoFramer, a multi-modal composition instruction framework. Given a poorly composed image, PhotoFramer first describes how to improve the composition in natural language and then generates a well-composed example image. To train such a model, we curate a large-scale dataset. Inspired by how humans take photos, we organize composition guidance into a hierarchy of sub-tasks: shift, zoom-in, and view-change tasks. Shift and zoom-in data are sampled from existing cropping datasets, while view-change data are obtained via a two-stage pipeline. First, we sample pairs with varying viewpoints from multi-view datasets, and train a degradation model to transform well-composed photos into poorly composed ones. Second, we apply this degradation model to expert-taken photos to synthesize poor images to form training pairs. Using this dataset, we finetune a model that jointly processes and generates both text and images, enabling actionable textual guidance with illustrative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that textual instructions effectively steer image composition, and coupling them with exemplars yields consistent improvements over exemplar-only baselines. PhotoFramer offers a practical step toward composition assistants that make expert photographic priors accessible to everyday users. Codes, model weights, and datasets have been released in https://zhiyuanyou.github.io/photoframer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2AM3D integrates 2D segmentation knowledge with 3D supervision for robust and consistent part-level point cloud segmentation, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization and consistency in 3D part-level segmentation, overcoming data scarcity issues of native 3D models and inconsistencies from integrating 2D pre-trained knowledge.

Method: The method involves a point-consistent part encoder for merging multi-view 2D features with 3D contrastive learning and a scale-aware prompt decoder for adjustable segmentation granularity. A new large-scale dataset is also introduced.

Result: Experiments show S2AM3D delivers superior performance, robustness, and control, especially with complex structures and varying part sizes.

Conclusion: S2AM3D effectively addresses the challenges in part-level segmentation by combining 2D and 3D strengths, setting a new standard in performance and versatility.

Abstract: Part-level point cloud segmentation has recently attracted significant attention in 3D computer vision. Nevertheless, existing research is constrained by two major challenges: native 3D models lack generalization due to data scarcity, while introducing 2D pre-trained knowledge often leads to inconsistent segmentation results across different views. To address these challenges, we propose S2AM3D, which incorporates 2D segmentation priors with 3D consistent supervision. We design a point-consistent part encoder that aggregates multi-view 2D features through native 3D contrastive learning, producing globally consistent point features. A scale-aware prompt decoder is then proposed to enable real-time adjustment of segmentation granularity via continuous scale signals. Simultaneously, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality part-level point cloud dataset with more than 100k samples, providing ample supervision signals for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S2AM3D achieves leading performance across multiple evaluation settings, exhibiting exceptional robustness and controllability when handling complex structures and parts with significant size variations.

Abstract: Medical imaging is essential for clinical diagnosis, yet real-world data frequently suffers from corruption, noise, and potential tampering, challenging the reliability of AI-assisted interpretation. Conventional reconstruction techniques prioritize pixel-level recovery and may produce visually plausible outputs while compromising anatomical fidelity, an issue that can directly impact clinical outcomes. We propose a semantic-aware medical image reconstruction framework that integrates high-level latent embeddings with a hybrid U-Net architecture to preserve clinically relevant structures during restoration. To ensure trust and accountability, we incorporate a lightweight blockchain-based provenance layer using scale-free graph design, enabling verifiable recording of each reconstruction event without imposing significant overhead. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and corruption types demonstrates improved structural consistency, restoration accuracy, and provenance integrity compared with existing approaches. By uniting semantic-guided reconstruction with secure traceability, our solution advances dependable AI for medical imaging, enhancing both diagnostic confidence and regulatory compliance in healthcare environments.

*Zhongbin Guo,Jiahe Liu,Wenyu Gao,Yushan Li,Chengzhi Li,Ping Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LISA-3D, a framework for text-driven 3D reconstruction using minimal adaptation and no additional 3D-text supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating consistent and open-vocabulary text-guided 3D reconstructions using language-image segmentation across viewpoints, while minimizing retraining and supervision requirements.

Method: The authors retrofitted the instruction-following model LISA with geometry-aware LoRA layers, reusing a frozen SAM-3D reconstructor. They trained it using differentiable reprojection loss on RGB-D data and their camera poses, creating modular RGBA prompts fed into SAM-3D for 3D generation.

Result: LISA-3D achieves up to 15.6 points improvement in language-to-3D accuracy on datasets like ScanRefer and Nr3D compared to baselines, while only adapting 11.6M parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed LISA-3D model is modular, data-efficient, and capable of zero-shot deployment, enhancing text-to-3D reconstruction capabilities with practical applications in content creation.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D reconstruction demands a mask generator that simultaneously understands open-vocabulary instructions and remains consistent across viewpoints. We present LISA-3D, a two-stage framework that lifts language-image segmentation into 3D by retrofitting the instruction-following model LISA with geometry-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers and reusing a frozen SAM-3D reconstructor. During training we exploit off-the-shelf RGB-D sequences and their camera poses to build a differentiable reprojection loss that enforces cross-view agreement without requiring any additional 3D-text supervision. The resulting masks are concatenated with RGB images to form RGBA prompts for SAM-3D, which outputs Gaussian splats or textured meshes without retraining. Across ScanRefer and Nr3D, LISA-3D improves language-to-3D accuracy by up to +15.6 points over single-view baselines while adapting only 11.6M parameters. The system is modular, data-efficient, and supports zero-shot deployment on unseen categories, providing a practical recipe for language-guided 3D content creation.

### [309] [Lotus-2: Advancing Geometric Dense Prediction with Powerful Image Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01030)
*Jing He,Haodong Li,Mingzhi Sheng,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lotus-2, a two-stage framework for accurate pixel-wise geometric property recovery from a single image, leveraging diffusion model priors for deterministic inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering geometric properties from a single image is challenging due to the inherent ambiguities and limitations of existing discriminative models, necessitating a new approach to exploit powerful pre-trained generative priors effectively.

Method: The Lotus-2 framework adopts a two-stage process: a core predictor for globally coherent output using a single-step deterministic approach and a detail sharpener for fine-grained geometry via rectified-flow refinement.

Result: Lotus-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in monocular depth estimation and strong results in surface normal prediction with significantly less training data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of leveraging diffusion model priors for deterministic geometric inferences, bridging the gap between generative and discriminative approaches for high-quality predictions.

Abstract: Recovering pixel-wise geometric properties from a single image is fundamentally ill-posed due to appearance ambiguity and non-injective mappings between 2D observations and 3D structures. While discriminative regression models achieve strong performance through large-scale supervision, their success is bounded by the scale, quality and diversity of available data and limited physical reasoning. Recent diffusion models exhibit powerful world priors that encode geometry and semantics learned from massive image-text data, yet directly reusing their stochastic generative formulation is suboptimal for deterministic geometric inference: the former is optimized for diverse and high-fidelity image generation, whereas the latter requires stable and accurate predictions. In this work, we propose Lotus-2, a two-stage deterministic framework for stable, accurate and fine-grained geometric dense prediction, aiming to provide an optimal adaption protocol to fully exploit the pre-trained generative priors. Specifically, in the first stage, the core predictor employs a single-step deterministic formulation with a clean-data objective and a lightweight local continuity module (LCM) to generate globally coherent structures without grid artifacts. In the second stage, the detail sharpener performs a constrained multi-step rectified-flow refinement within the manifold defined by the core predictor, enhancing fine-grained geometry through noise-free deterministic flow matching. Using only 59K training samples, less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, Lotus-2 establishes new state-of-the-art results in monocular depth estimation and highly competitive surface normal prediction. These results demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as deterministic world priors, enabling high-quality geometric reasoning beyond traditional discriminative and generative paradigms.

### [310] [TRoVe: Discovering Error-Inducing Static Feature Biases in Temporal Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01048)
*Maya Varma,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck,Sophie Ostmeier,Akshay Chaudhari,Curtis Langlotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRoVe, a method to identify and characterize static feature biases in vision-language models (VLMs) for temporal understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the deployment of vision-language models by identifying static feature biases that cause systematic errors in predictions.

Method: TRoVe automatically discovers and scores static feature biases in trained VLMs using an annotated validation dataset. Evaluation was performed with a framework comprising 101 VLMs and ground-truth bias annotations.

Result: TRoVe achieved a 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline in identifying error-inducing biases. It revealed previously unknown biases and showed that addressing these biases can improve model performance.

Conclusion: Static feature biases are critical to address for robust VLM performance. TRoVe provides an effective tool for bias discovery, making temporal VLMs more reliable in real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made great strides in addressing temporal understanding tasks, which involve characterizing visual changes across a sequence of images. However, recent works have suggested that when making predictions, VLMs may rely on static feature biases, such as background or object features, rather than dynamic visual changes. Static feature biases are a type of shortcut and can contribute to systematic prediction errors on downstream tasks; as a result, identifying and characterizing error-inducing static feature biases is critical prior to real-world model deployment. In this work, we introduce TRoVe, an automated approach for discovering error-inducing static feature biases learned by temporal VLMs. Given a trained VLM and an annotated validation dataset associated with a downstream classification task, TRoVe extracts candidate static features from the dataset and scores each feature by (i) the effect of the feature on classification errors as well as (ii) the extent to which the VLM relies on the feature when making predictions. In order to quantitatively evaluate TRoVe, we introduce an evaluation framework consisting of 101 trained temporal VLMs paired with ground-truth annotations for learned static feature biases. We use this framework to demonstrate that TRoVe can accurately identify error-inducing static feature biases in VLMs, achieving a 28.6% improvement over the closest baseline. Finally, we apply TRoVe to 7 off-the-shelf VLMs and 2 temporal understanding tasks, surfacing previously-unknown static feature biases and demonstrating that knowledge of learned biases can aid in improving model performance at test time.

### [311] [Parameter Reduction Improves Vision Transformers: A Comparative Study of Sharing and Width Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01059)
*Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores parameter reduction in Vision Transformers, achieving increased accuracy and stability despite fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether reducing parameters in Vision Transformer architectures can maintain or improve accuracy and training stability.

Method: Proposes two parameter-reduction strategies—GroupedMLP with shared weights across transformer blocks, and ShallowMLP with halved MLP hidden dimension.

Result: GroupedMLP achieves top-1 accuracy of 81.47%, ShallowMLP achieves 81.25%, both outperforming the baseline (81.05%) while improving throughput and stability.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer models are overparameterized, and strategic reductions like parameter sharing and width constraints improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Although scaling laws and many empirical results suggest that increasing the size of Vision Transformers often improves performance, model accuracy and training behavior are not always monotonically increasing with scale. Focusing on ViT-B/16 trained on ImageNet-1K, we study two simple parameter-reduction strategies applied to the MLP blocks, each removing 32.7\% of the baseline parameters. Our \emph{GroupedMLP} variant shares MLP weights between adjacent transformer blocks and achieves 81.47\% top-1 accuracy while maintaining the baseline computational cost. Our \emph{ShallowMLP} variant halves the MLP hidden dimension and reaches 81.25\% top-1 accuracy with a 38\% increase in inference throughput. Both models outperform the 86.6M-parameter baseline (81.05\%) and exhibit substantially improved training stability, reducing peak-to-final accuracy degradation from 0.47\% to the range 0.03\% to 0.06\%. These results suggest that, for ViT-B/16 on ImageNet-1K with a standard training recipe, the model operates in an overparameterized regime in which MLP capacity can be reduced without harming performance and can even slightly improve it. More broadly, our findings suggest that architectural constraints such as parameter sharing and reduced width may act as useful inductive biases, and highlight the importance of how parameters are allocated when designing Vision Transformers.

### [312] [Accelerating Inference of Masked Image Generators via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01094)
*Pranav Subbaraman,Shufan Li,Siyan Zhao,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Speed-RL is a reinforcement learning-based approach that accelerates Masked Generative Models (MGMs) to generate high-quality images three times faster while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper lies in the need to address the slow inference speed of Masked Generative Models (MGMs) due to their requirement for excessive sampling steps to generate high-quality images.

Method: The paper introduces Speed-RL, which reframes the MGM acceleration task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. It combines a quality reward and a speed reward, optimizing a pretrained MGM using the RL-based reward mechanism.

Result: The proposed Speed-RL method successfully reduces the acceleration time of MGMs by a factor of 3x. Despite this speedup, the image quality achieved remains comparable to that of the original model.

Conclusion: Speed-RL provides an effective paradigm for accelerating image generation in Masked Generative Models without compromising on output quality, showcasing the potential of reinforcement learning in optimization tasks.

Abstract: Masked Generative Models (MGM)s demonstrate strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, they need many sampling steps to create high-quality generations, resulting in slow inference speed. In this work, we propose Speed-RL, a novel paradigm for accelerating a pretrained MGMs to generate high-quality images in fewer steps. Unlike conventional distillation methods which formulate the acceleration problem as a distribution matching problem, where a few-step student model is trained to match the distribution generated by a many-step teacher model, we consider this problem as a reinforcement learning problem. Since the goal of acceleration is to generate high quality images in fewer steps, we can combine a quality reward with a speed reward and finetune the base model using reinforcement learning with the combined reward as the optimization target. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method was able to accelerate the base model by a factor of 3x while maintaining comparable image quality.

*Simon Kohaut,Daniel Ochs,Shun Zhang,Benedict Flade,Julian Eggert,Kristian Kersting,Devendra Singh Dhami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CycliST is a benchmark dataset for evaluating Video Language Models (VLMs) on cyclical state transitions and reveals their limitations in spatio-temporal cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current VLMs regarding their ability to understand cyclical patterns and temporal reasoning in video data.

Method: Built a synthetic video dataset, CycliST, featuring layered challenges like cyclical object motion, cluttered scenes, and varying light conditions to stress-test VLMs.

Result: Current VLMs fail to consistently understand cyclical patterns, lack temporal reasoning, and perform inconsistently across tasks without correlation to size or architecture.

Conclusion: CycliST identifies a significant weakness in VLMs' spatio-temporal reasoning and paves the path for next-generation visual reasoning models.

Abstract: We present CycliST, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate Video Language Models (VLM) on their ability for textual reasoning over cyclical state transitions. CycliST captures fundamental aspects of real-world processes by generating synthetic, richly structured video sequences featuring periodic patterns in object motion and visual attributes. CycliST employs a tiered evaluation system that progressively increases difficulty through variations in the number of cyclic objects, scene clutter, and lighting conditions, challenging state-of-the-art models on their spatio-temporal cognition. We conduct extensive experiments with current state-of-the-art VLMs, both open-source and proprietary, and reveal their limitations in generalizing to cyclical dynamics such as linear and orbital motion, as well as time-dependent changes in visual attributes like color and scale. Our results demonstrate that present-day VLMs struggle to reliably detect and exploit cyclic patterns, lack a notion of temporal understanding, and are unable to extract quantitative insights from scenes, such as the number of objects in motion, highlighting a significant technical gap that needs to be addressed. More specifically, we find no single model consistently leads in performance: neither size nor architecture correlates strongly with outcomes, and no model succeeds equally well across all tasks. By providing a targeted challenge and a comprehensive evaluation framework, CycliST paves the way for visual reasoning models that surpass the state-of-the-art in understanding periodic patterns.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework that learns spectral basis for shape and manifold analysis directly from unstructured data, eliminating complex traditional steps like operator selection and eigensolvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace traditional operator-based methods requiring discretization and eigensolvers with a more flexible, data-driven approach to handle unstructured data in geometry processing.

Method: A network is trained to decompose an implicit approximation operator by minimizing reconstruction error in a learned spectral basis over a distribution of probe functions, approximating the Laplacian operator without explicit construction.

Result: The proposed method successfully recovers spectral bases, sampling densities, and eigenvalues in a unified way, yielding results consistent with traditional Laplacian methods but in a more scalable and unsupervised manner.

Conclusion: By introducing a learning-based framework, the paper provides a robust alternative to traditional geometry processing pipelines, enabling efficient analysis of unstructured and high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that directly learns a spectral basis for shape and manifold analysis from unstructured data, eliminating the need for traditional operator selection, discretization, and eigensolvers. Grounded in optimal-approximation theory, we train a network to decompose an implicit approximation operator by minimizing the reconstruction error in the learned basis over a chosen distribution of probe functions. For suitable distributions, they can be seen as an approximation of the Laplacian operator and its eigendecomposition, which are fundamental in geometry processing. Furthermore, our method recovers in a unified manner not only the spectral basis, but also the implicit metric's sampling density and the eigenvalues of the underlying operator. Notably, our unsupervised method makes no assumption on the data manifold, such as meshing or manifold dimensionality, allowing it to scale to arbitrary datasets of any dimension. On point clouds lying on surfaces in 3D and high-dimensional image manifolds, our approach yields meaningful spectral bases, that can resemble those of the Laplacian, without explicit construction of an operator. By replacing the traditional operator selection, construction, and eigendecomposition with a learning-based approach, our framework offers a principled, data-driven alternative to conventional pipelines. This opens new possibilities in geometry processing for unstructured data, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlotSPE, a framework that efficiently models multimodal data for cancer survival prediction, improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with high-dimensional, complex data and fail to capture sparse, unannotated prognostic events critical for cancer patient survival.

Method: SlotSPE uses slot attention to compress multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific representations, modeling intra- and inter-modal interactions while incorporating biological insights.

Result: SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in survival prediction in 8 out of 10 cancer datasets, achieving a 2.9% improvement overall, remaining robust despite missing genomic data, and offering better interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed SlotSPE framework advances survival prediction in cancer by effectively capturing critical events, improving outcomes, and enhancing model interpretability.

Abstract: The integration of histology images and gene profiles has shown great promise for improving survival prediction in cancer. However, current approaches often struggle to model intra- and inter-modal interactions efficiently and effectively due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the inputs. A major challenge is capturing critical prognostic events that, though few, underlie the complexity of the observed inputs and largely determine patient outcomes. These events, manifested as high-level structural signals such as spatial histologic patterns or pathway co-activations, are typically sparse, patient-specific, and unannotated, making them inherently difficult to uncover. To address this, we propose SlotSPE, a slot-based framework for structural prognostic event modeling. Specifically, inspired by the principle of factorial coding, we compress each patient's multimodal inputs into compact, modality-specific sets of mutually distinctive slots using slot attention. By leveraging these slot representations as encodings for prognostic events, our framework enables both efficient and effective modeling of complex intra- and inter-modal interactions, while also facilitating seamless incorporation of biological priors that enhance prognostic relevance. Extensive experiments on ten cancer benchmarks show that SlotSPE outperforms existing methods in 8 out of 10 cohorts, achieving an overall improvement of 2.9%. It remains robust under missing genomic data and delivers markedly improved interpretability through structured event decomposition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFD introduces a unified framework to simultaneously manage four core tasks in face forgery detection: image classification, video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization, utilizing a shared architecture for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face forgery detection frameworks rely on task-specific models, leading to inefficiencies and ignoring correlations across tasks. A unified solution is needed to improve efficiency and leverage inter-task relationships.

Method: OmniFD employs a shared Swin Transformer encoder for 4D spatiotemporal representations, a cross-task interaction module for inter-task dependency reasoning, and lightweight decoding heads for predictions.

Result: OmniFD achieves superior performance across benchmarks, improves video classification accuracy by 4.63% leveraging image data, reduces model parameters by 63%, and cuts training time by 50%.

Conclusion: OmniFD offers an efficient, scalable, and generalizable solution for face forgery detection tasks, setting a benchmark for unified detection frameworks in practical applications.

Abstract: Face forgery detection encompasses multiple critical tasks, including identifying forged images and videos and localizing manipulated regions and temporal segments. Current approaches typically employ task-specific models with independent architectures, leading to computational redundancy and ignoring potential correlations across related tasks. We introduce OmniFD, a unified framework that jointly addresses four core face forgery detection tasks within a single model, i.e., image and video classification, spatial localization, and temporal localization. Our architecture consists of three principal components: (1) a shared Swin Transformer encoder that extracts unified 4D spatiotemporal representations from both images and video inputs, (2) a cross-task interaction module with learnable queries that dynamically captures inter-task dependencies through attention-based reasoning, and (3) lightweight decoding heads that transform refined representations into corresponding predictions for all FFD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate OmniFD's advantage over task-specific models. Its unified design leverages multi-task learning to capture generalized representations across tasks, especially enabling fine-grained knowledge transfer that facilitates other tasks. For example, video classification accuracy improves by 4.63% when image data are incorporated. Furthermore, by unifying images, videos and the four tasks within one framework, OmniFD achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks with high efficiency and scalability, e.g., reducing 63% model parameters and 50% training time. It establishes a practical and generalizable solution for comprehensive face forgery detection in real-world applications. The source code is made available at https://github.com/haotianll/OmniFD.

### [317] [Weakly Supervised Continuous Micro-Expression Intensity Estimation Using Temporal Deep Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01145)
*Riyadh Mohammed Almushrafy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for estimating continuous micro-expression intensity without requiring frame-level annotations using weak temporal labels. It achieves high correlation metrics on the SAMM and CASME II datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses on classifying discrete micro-expression categories, but lacks approaches addressing the continuous evolution of intensity due to the absence of frame-level intensity labels.

Method: A triangular prior converts temporal labels into pseudo-intensity trajectories, and a regression model using ResNet18 and bidirectional GRU predicts intensity from image sequences. Sparse temporal annotations (onset, apex, offset) are used, eliminating the need for frame-level labels.

Result: The method outperforms a baseline by achieving strong temporal correlation metrics on SAMM (Spearman: 0.9014, Kendall: 0.7999) and CASME II (Spearman: 0.9116, Kendall: 0.8168). Ablation studies validate the approach.

Conclusion: This is the first framework for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using weak temporal annotations, demonstrating strong performance and robustness across datasets.

Abstract: Micro-facial expressions are brief and involuntary facial movements that reflect genuine emotional states. While most prior work focuses on classifying discrete micro-expression categories, far fewer studies address the continuous evolution of intensity over time. Progress in this direction is limited by the lack of frame-level intensity labels, which makes fully supervised regression impractical.
  We propose a unified framework for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only weak temporal labels (onset, apex, offset). A simple triangular prior converts sparse temporal landmarks into dense pseudo-intensity trajectories, and a lightweight temporal regression model that combines a ResNet18 encoder with a bidirectional GRU predicts frame-wise intensity directly from image sequences. The method requires no frame-level annotation effort and is applied consistently across datasets through a single preprocessing and temporal alignment pipeline.
  Experiments on SAMM and CASME II show strong temporal agreement with the pseudo-intensity trajectories. On SAMM, the model reaches a Spearman correlation of 0.9014 and a Kendall correlation of 0.7999, outperforming a frame-wise baseline. On CASME II, it achieves up to 0.9116 and 0.8168, respectively, when trained without the apex-ranking term. Ablation studies confirm that temporal modeling and structured pseudo labels are central to capturing the rise-apex-fall dynamics of micro-facial movements.
  To our knowledge, this is the first unified approach for continuous micro-expression intensity estimation using only sparse temporal annotations.

### [318] [SocialFusion: Addressing Social Degradation in Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01148)
*Hamza Tahboub,Weiyan Shi,Gang Hua,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a problem in current vision-language models (VLMs) called 'social degradation,' which hinders their ability to perform multiple social perception tasks simultaneously. To solve this, the authors propose SocialFusion, a framework that enhances understanding of social cues and achieves superior results across tasks compared to existing VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve AI's social competence by enabling VLMs to perform multiple social perception tasks effectively, overcoming the negative transfer effects.

Method: The authors introduced SocialFusion, a framework that minimally connects a frozen visual encoder with a language model while utilizing synergies among social tasks. Additionally, they investigate the social degradation issue using linear representation probing and gradient conflict analysis.

Result: SocialFusion demonstrates positive transfer across five social tasks and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific models, addressing the social degradation challenge effectively.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize that current VLM pre-training strategies are not optimized for general social competence and advocate for training paradigms that are more socially aware.

Abstract: Understanding social interactions from visual cues is a fundamental challenge for a socially competent AI. While powerful pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable general capabilities, they surprisingly struggle to unify and learn multiple social perception tasks simultaneously, often exhibiting negative transfer. We identify that this negative transfer stems from a critical issue we term "social degradation," whereby the general visual-linguistic pre-training process of VLMs impairs the visual encoder's ability to represent nuanced social information. We investigate this behavior further under two lenses: decodability through linear representation probing and compatibility through gradient conflict analysis, revealing that both play a role in the degradation, especially the former, which is significantly compromised in the VLM pre-training process. To address these issues, we propose SocialFusion, a unified framework that learns a minimal connection between a frozen visual encoder and a language model. Compared with existing VLMs, it exhibits positive transfer across all five social tasks, leveraging synergies between them to enhance overall performance and achieves comparable performance to task-specific state-of-the-art models on various benchmarks. Our findings suggest that current VLM pre-training strategies may be detrimental to acquiring general social competence and highlight the need for more socially-aware training paradigms.

TL;DR: The paper addresses quality degradation in adversarially guided diffusion sampling, proposes a theoretical framework linking control energy and sample quality, and introduces the DPAC method to improve outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of degraded sample quality in adversarially guided diffusion sampling by formalizing a connection between control energy and perceptual fidelity.

Method: The authors analyze the path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence (path-KL) between controlled and nominal diffusion processes, derive optimality conditions for control directions, and propose the DPAC method, which projects adversarial gradients onto generative score geometries to minimize quality degradation.

Result: Theoretical analyses reveal that DPAC improves diffusion guidance quality. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 show better Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and path-KL metrics at similar attack success rates.

Conclusion: DPAC achieves better sample quality by minimizing distributional drift and path-KL, making it a theoretically principled and empirically validated method for adversarial control in diffusion sampling.

Abstract: Adversarially guided diffusion sampling often achieves the target class, but sample quality degrades as deviations between the adversarially controlled and nominal trajectories accumulate. We formalize this degradation as a path-space Kullback-Leibler divergence(path-KL) between controlled and nominal (uncontrolled) diffusion processes, thereby showing via Girsanov's theorem that it exactly equals the control energy. Building on this stochastic optimal control (SOC) view, we theoretically establish that minimizing this path-KL simultaneously tightens upper bounds on both the 2-Wasserstein distance and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), revealing a principled connection between adversarial control energy and perceptual fidelity. From a variational perspective, we derive a first-order optimality condition for the control: among all directions that yield the same classification gain, the component tangent to iso-(log-)density surfaces (i.e., orthogonal to the score) minimizes path-KL, whereas the normal component directly increases distributional drift. This leads to DPAC (Distribution-Preserving Adversarial Control), a diffusion guidance rule that projects adversarial gradients onto the tangent space defined by the generative score geometry. We further show that in discrete solvers, the tangent projection cancels the O(Δt) leading error term in the Wasserstein distance, achieving an O(Δt^2) quality gap; moreover, it remains second-order robust to score or metric approximation. Empirical studies on ImageNet-100 validate the theoretical predictions, confirming that DPAC achieves lower FID and estimated path-KL at matched attack success rates.

### [320] [VSRD++: Autolabeling for 3D Object Detection via Instance-Aware Volumetric Silhouette Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01178)
*Zihua Liu,Hiroki Sakuma,Masatoshi Okutomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSRD++ introduces a weakly supervised pipeline for monocular 3D object detection using neural-field-based volumetric rendering, bypassing extensive 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the dependency on labor-intensive 3D annotations for monocular 3D object detection using a weakly supervised approach.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage pipeline: autolabeling using signed distance fields and velocity-augmented bounding boxes, followed by monocular 3D detector training.

Result: VSRD++ achieves superior performance in static and dynamic scene object detection compared to existing weakly supervised methods on the KITTI-360 dataset.

Conclusion: The novel VSRD++ framework provides an efficient alternative to supervised methods by harnessing weak 2D supervision and refining pseudo-labels for monocular 3D detection.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D scene understanding. Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tabletop scenes are difficult to generate due to their high-density layout and spatial complexity. This paper presents TabletopGen, a training-free framework for generating instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes using reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI, especially for robotic manipulation tasks and data synthesis, requires realistic and physically interactive 3D tabletop scenes. Existing methods struggle with creating these dense, complex environments.

Method: TabletopGen is a fully automatic framework utilizing a reference image to perform instance segmentation, 3D reconstruction, pose, and scale alignment. The framework employs a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for precise 3D reconstruction.

Result: TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art outcomes in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility. It generates realistic, diverse 3D tabletop scenes suitable for simulation.

Conclusion: TabletopGen advances the generation of high-quality interactive tabletop scenes and can significantly benefit embodied AI tasks. The code will be open-sourced to encourage further research and development.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity, physically interactive 3D simulated tabletop scenes is essential for embodied AI--especially for robotic manipulation policy learning and data synthesis. However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity. Our code will be publicly available.

### [322] [Closing the Approximation Gap of Partial AUC Optimization: A Tale of Two Formulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01213)
*Yangbangyan Jiang,Qianqian Xu,Huiyang Shao,Zhiyong Yang,Shilong Bao,Xiaochun Cao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of optimizing partial AUC (PAUC) metrics and introduces two minimax reformulations with efficient computation and improved generalization bounds, validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the NP-hardness of computing partial AUC (PAUC) under class imbalance and decision constraints, which suffers from approximation errors and scalability issues in existing methods.

Method: The paper proposes two instance-wise minimax reformulations for PAUC optimization, employing equivalent problem reformulations, threshold learning, and smoothing techniques, with an efficient solver achieving linear computation and convergence rates.

Result: The proposed methods achieve linear per-iteration computational complexity and improved generalization bounds, showing explicitly how TPR/FPR constraints impact generalization. Benchmarks confirm the efficacy through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: This work provides efficient and theoretically grounded PAUC optimization techniques, closing approximation gaps and demonstrating strong experimental performance under constrained conditions.

Abstract: As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of $O(ε^{-1/3})$ for typical one-way and two-way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations. The result explicitly demonstrates the impact of the TPR/FPR constraints $α$/$β$ on the generalization and exhibits a sharp order of $\tilde{O}(α^{-1}\n_+^{-1} + β^{-1}\n_-^{-1})$. Finally, extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the strength of our proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on localized facial manipulation detection, which is critical in ensuring information reliability in the digital era.

Method: The M4-BLIP framework leverages the BLIP-2 model for local feature extraction and integrates local facial information using a custom alignment and fusion module. It incorporates Large Language Models for improved interpretability.

Result: Experiments show that M4-BLIP performs effectively and achieves stronger detection accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Combining localized feature analysis with powerful modeling methods enhances detection and improves interpretability, making it a valuable solution for combating multi-modal media manipulation.

Abstract: In the contemporary digital landscape, multi-modal media manipulation has emerged as a significant societal threat, impacting the reliability and integrity of information dissemination. Current detection methodologies in this domain often overlook the crucial aspect of localized information, despite the fact that manipulations frequently occur in specific areas, particularly in facial regions. In response to this critical observation, we propose the M4-BLIP framework. This innovative framework utilizes the BLIP-2 model, renowned for its ability to extract local features, as the cornerstone for feature extraction. Complementing this, we incorporate local facial information as prior knowledge. A specially designed alignment and fusion module within M4-BLIP meticulously integrates these local and global features, creating a harmonious blend that enhances detection accuracy. Furthermore, our approach seamlessly integrates with Large Language Models (LLM), significantly improving the interpretability of the detection outcomes. Extensive quantitative and visualization experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework against the state-of-the-art competitors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces S$^2$-MLLM, a framework for efficient and accurate 3D visual grounding that overcomes limitations of Multi-modal Large Language Models in understanding 3D spatial structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle to process 3D spatial structures efficiently and rely on viewpoint-dependent tools, which are inefficient and limited for 3D scene understanding.

Method: S$^2$-MLLM enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial guidance with feed-forward 3D reconstruction and a structure-enhanced module leveraging intra-view and inter-view attention and positional encodings.

Result: Experimental results show that S$^2$-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets (ScanRefer, Nr3D, Sr3D) with superior generalization and efficiency.

Conclusion: S$^2$-MLLM provides a significant advancement for 3DVG tasks by efficiently improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs without relying on point cloud reconstructions, achieving high accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in personalized image generation involving multiple subjects by introducing a scalable data generation pipeline, new evaluation benchmarks, and refined reinforcement learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized generation models struggle to maintain performance when dealing with multiple subjects due to lack of quality data and well-defined post-training strategies.

Method: The authors propose a new data pipeline for generating high-quality multi-subject datasets, incorporate Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards into reinforcement learning, and create a benchmark for evaluation.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve subject consistency, text controllability, and the overall quality of multi-subject personalized image generation models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses existing limitations in multi-subject personalized image generation and offers robust methodologies for better performance and evaluation.

Abstract: Personalized generation models for a single subject have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, highlighting their significant potential. However, when extended to multiple subjects, existing models often exhibit degraded performance, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and adhering to textual prompts. We attribute these limitations to the absence of high-quality multi-subject datasets and refined post-training strategies. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable multi-subject data generation pipeline that leverages powerful single-subject generation models to construct diverse and high-quality multi-subject training data. Through this dataset, we first enable single-subject personalization models to acquire knowledge of synthesizing multi-image and multi-subject scenarios. Furthermore, to enhance both subject consistency and text controllability, we design a set of Pairwise Subject-Consistency Rewards and general-purpose rewards, which are incorporated into a refined reinforcement learning stage. To comprehensively evaluate multi-subject personalization, we introduce a new benchmark that assesses model performance using seven subsets across three dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in advancing multi-subject personalized image generation. Github Link: https://github.com/wang-shulei/PSR

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRivia, a self-supervised method for fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) to perform table recognition (TR) without labeled data. It surpasses existing models on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving table recognition (TR) performance through labeled data, which is costly and impractical for many open-source models due to resource constraints and privacy regulations.

Method: TRivia uses self-supervised learning by relying on a question-answering-based reward mechanism and an attention-guided module. It identifies effective unlabeled samples to optimize TR results in a closed-loop process without human annotations.

Result: TRivia achieves state-of-the-art performance in TR, surpassing popular proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and MinerU2.5 on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: TRivia effectively bridges the performance gap between open-source and proprietary TR models by leveraging unlabeled data, offering an open-source and cost-effective solution for table recognition.

Abstract: Table recognition (TR) aims to transform table images into semi-structured representations such as HTML or Markdown. As a core component of document parsing, TR has long relied on supervised learning, with recent efforts dominated by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) using labeled data. While VLMs have brought TR to the next level, pushing performance further demands large-scale labeled data that is costly to obtain. Consequently, although proprietary models have continuously pushed the performance boundary, open-source models, often trained with limited resources and, in practice, the only viable option for many due to privacy regulations, still lag far behind. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRivia, a self-supervised fine-tuning method that enables pretrained VLMs to learn TR directly from unlabeled table images in the wild. Built upon Group Relative Policy Optimization, TRivia automatically identifies unlabeled samples that most effectively facilitate learning and eliminates the need for human annotations through a question-answering-based reward mechanism. An attention-guided module generates diverse questions for each table image, and the ability to interpret the recognition results and answer them correctly provides feedback to optimize the TR model. This closed-loop process allows the TR model to autonomously learn to recognize, structure, and reason over tables without labeled data. Leveraging this pipeline, we present TRivia-3B, an open-sourced, compact, and state-of-the-art TR model that surpasses existing systems (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, MinerU2.5) on three popular benchmarks. Model and code are released at: https://github.com/opendatalab/TRivia

TL;DR: The paper introduces a computer-vision-based viscometer for non-invasive viscosity measurement under real process conditions using optical distortions from liquid surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional viscometers are invasive and require controlled environments that differ from actual process conditions, hindering effective monitoring. There is a need for non-invasive, automation-compatible viscosity measurement methods.

Method: The proposed viscometer employs computer vision to analyze optical distortions caused by light refracting through mixing-driven liquid surfaces. It uses regression models and viscosity-class predictions, enhanced by a multi-pattern strategy and uncertainty quantification.

Result: The system achieves a mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m2 s^-1 for regression and up to 81% accuracy for viscosity classification. Robustness is improved with multi-pattern strategy, despite challenges with closely clustered viscosities.

Conclusion: This stand-off viscometer is practical and automation-ready, offering a non-invasive alternative to existing viscometry methods with reliable performance and confidence estimates.

Abstract: Viscosity measurement is essential for process monitoring and autonomous laboratory operation, yet conventional viscometers remain invasive and require controlled laboratory environments that differ substantially from real process conditions. We present a computer-vision-based viscometer that infers viscosity by exploiting how a fixed background pattern becomes optically distorted as light refracts through the mixing-driven, continuously deforming free surface. Under diverse lighting conditions, the system achieves a mean absolute error of 0.113 in log m2 s^-1 units for regression and reaches up to 81% accuracy in viscosity-class prediction. Although performance declines for classes with closely clustered viscosity values, a multi-pattern strategy improves robustness by providing enriched visual cues. To ensure sensor reliability, we incorporate uncertainty quantification, enabling viscosity predictions with confidence estimates. This stand-off viscometer offers a practical, automation-ready alternative to existing viscometry methods.

Motivation: Automated retinal image analysis is vital for early detection and treatment of diseases, but existing convolutional architectures struggle with the irregular vascular and lesion patterns critical for diagnosis.

Method: The paper proposes nnMobileNet++, integrating dynamic snake convolution for boundary features, stage-specific transformer blocks for global context, and retinal image pretraining for improved generalization.

Result: nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy on public retinal datasets with reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: nnMobileNet++ is a lightweight, efficient, and effective framework for comprehensive retinal image analysis, improving diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Retinal imaging is a critical, non-invasive modality for the early detection and monitoring of ocular and systemic diseases. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significant progress in automated retinal analysis, supporting tasks such as fundus image classification, lesion detection, and vessel segmentation. As a representative lightweight network, nnMobileNet has demonstrated strong performance across multiple retinal benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient. However, purely convolutional architectures inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies and model the irregular lesions and elongated vascular patterns that characterize on retinal images, despite the critical importance of vascular features for reliable clinical diagnosis. To further advance this line of work and extend the original vision of nnMobileNet, we propose nnMobileNet++, a hybrid architecture that progressively bridges convolutional and transformer representations. The framework integrates three key components: (i) dynamic snake convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, (ii) stage-specific transformer blocks introduced after the second down-sampling stage for global context modeling, and (iii) retinal image pretraining to improve generalization. Experiments on multiple public retinal datasets for classification, together with ablation studies, demonstrate that nnMobileNet++ achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive accuracy while maintaining low computational cost, underscoring its potential as a lightweight yet effective framework for retinal image analysis.

Abstract: Acoustic sonar image analysis plays a critical role in object detection and classification, with applications in both civilian and defense domains. Despite the availability of real and synthetic datasets, existing AI models that achieve high accuracy often over-rely on seafloor features, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates two key modules: (i) a Targeted Contrastive Unlearning (TCU) module, which extends the traditional triplet loss to reduce seafloor-induced background bias and improve generalization, and (ii) the Unlearn to Explain Sonar Framework (UESF), which provides visual insights into what the model has deliberately forgotten while adapting the LIME explainer to generate more faithful and localized attributions for unlearning evaluation. Extensive experiments across both real and synthetic sonar datasets validate our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in unlearning effectiveness, model robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedSegLatDiff, a framework using VAE and latent diffusion for efficient and diverse medical image segmentation. It outperforms benchmarks in various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation methods fail to address inherent uncertainty and are computationally intensive. The authors aim to provide a lightweight and efficient solution capable of diversity.

Method: The model integrates a VAE to compress input into a low-dimensional latent space, paired with latent diffusion for segmentation. It replaces MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in reconstruction to retain small structures.

Result: MedSegLatDiff achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results on skin lesion, polyp, and lung nodule segmentation datasets while providing diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps.

Conclusion: MedSegLatDiff proves interpretable, reliable, and computationally efficient, making it suitable for clinical deployment compared to deterministic baselines.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods typically produce a single segmentation mask, failing to capture inherent uncertainty. Recent generative models enable the creation of multiple plausible masks per image, mimicking the collaborative interpretation of several clinicians. However, these approaches remain computationally heavy. We propose MedSegLatDiff, a diffusion based framework that combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a latent diffusion model for efficient medical image segmentation. The VAE compresses the input into a low dimensional latent space, reducing noise and accelerating training, while the diffusion process operates directly in this compact representation. We further replace the conventional MSE loss with weighted cross entropy in the VAE mask reconstruction path to better preserve tiny structures such as small nodules. MedSegLatDiff is evaluated on ISIC-2018 (skin lesions), CVC-Clinic (polyps), and LIDC-IDRI (lung nodules). It achieves state of the art or highly competitive Dice and IoU scores while simultaneously generating diverse segmentation hypotheses and confidence maps. This provides enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to deterministic baselines, making the model particularly suitable for clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable-rendering-based SLAM systems face challenges in real-time computation and sensitivity to sensor noise, resulting in reduced geometric fidelity and limited practicality.

Method: The proposed EGG-Fusion system uses sparse-to-dense camera tracking, geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping, and an information filter-based fusion method to account for sensor noise for accurate surface reconstruction.

Result: EGG-Fusion achieves a 0.6 cm surface reconstruction error on Replica and ScanNet++ datasets, with over 20% improved accuracy compared to SOTA methods, operating in real-time at 24 FPS.

Conclusion: EGG-Fusion is a highly accurate, real-time differentiable-rendering-based reconstruction system, balancing precision and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Real-time 3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TBT-Former, an improvement over ActionFormer, for Temporal Action Localization by addressing temporal boundary localization and multi-scale fusion challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by limitations in precise boundary localization and multi-scale contextual information fusion in existing TAL models, especially in single-stage approaches like ActionFormer.

Method: The paper presents TBT-Former featuring a scaled Transformer backbone, cross-scale feature pyramid network, and a boundary distribution regression head leveraging probability distribution learning.

Result: TBT-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, and remains competitive on ActivityNet-1.3.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly enhances TAL tasks by addressing boundary uncertainty and context integration challenges, setting a new benchmark for Transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) remains a fundamental challenge in video understanding, aiming to identify the start time, end time, and category of all action instances within untrimmed videos. While recent single-stage, anchor-free models like ActionFormer have set a high standard by leveraging Transformers for temporal reasoning, they often struggle with two persistent issues: the precise localization of actions with ambiguous or "fuzzy" temporal boundaries and the effective fusion of multi-scale contextual information. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Boundary Transformer (TBT-Former), a new architecture that directly addresses these limitations. TBT-Former enhances the strong ActionFormer baseline with three core contributions: (1) a higher-capacity scaled Transformer backbone with an increased number of attention heads and an expanded Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) dimension for more powerful temporal feature extraction; (2) a cross-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) that integrates a top-down pathway with lateral connections, enabling richer fusion of high-level semantics and low-level temporal details; and (3) a novel boundary distribution regression head. Inspired by the principles of Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), this new head recasts the challenging task of boundary regression as a more flexible probability distribution learning problem, allowing the model to explicitly represent and reason about boundary uncertainty. Within the paradigm of Transformer-based architectures, TBT-Former advances the formidable benchmark set by its predecessors, establishing a new level of performance on the highly competitive THUMOS14 and EPIC-Kitchens 100 datasets, while remaining competitive on the large-scale ActivityNet-1.3.

*Jaewoo Song,Jooyoung Choi,Kanghyun Baek,Sangyub Lee,Daemin Park,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCText is a training-free text-to-image generation method using a divide-and-conquer strategy to render accurate text, especially effective for long or multiple texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with accurately rendering long or multiple texts due to limitations like diluted global attention.

Method: DCText uses a divide-and-conquer approach by decomposing prompts, assigning them to regions, and employing attention masks and localized noise initialization during denoising.

Result: DCText delivers superior text accuracy and region alignment along with high image quality and the lowest generation latency.

Conclusion: DCText significantly improves text rendering in visual generation, especially for complex prompts, without sacrificing efficiency or quality.

Abstract: Despite recent text-to-image models achieving highfidelity text rendering, they still struggle with long or multiple texts due to diluted global attention. We propose DCText, a training-free visual text generation method that adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, leveraging the reliable short-text generation of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers. Our method first decomposes a prompt by extracting and dividing the target text, then assigns each to a designated region. To accurately render each segment within their regions while preserving overall image coherence, we introduce two attention masks - Text-Focus and Context-Expansion - applied sequentially during denoising. Additionally, Localized Noise Initialization further improves text accuracy and region alignment without increasing computational cost. Extensive experiments on single- and multisentence benchmarks show that DCText achieves the best text accuracy without compromising image quality while also delivering the lowest generation latency.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve aerodynamic simulations in vision and graphics by overcoming the drawbacks of mesh-based and particle-based methods, such as inefficiency and discrete modeling.

Method: The authors propose Gaussian Swaying, which models surfaces using continuous 3D Gaussians for efficient aerodynamic interaction and rendering using Gaussian patches for unified simulation and shading.

Result: Their approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and efficiency in aerodynamic simulations on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Gaussian Swaying provides a scalable and efficient method for realistic aerodynamic simulations, advancing the state of the art and offering practical benefits for vision and graphics.

Abstract: Branches swaying in the breeze, flags rippling in the wind, and boats rocking on the water all show how aerodynamics shape natural motion -- an effect crucial for realism in vision and graphics. In this paper, we present Gaussian Swaying, a surface-based framework for aerodynamic simulation using 3D Gaussians. Unlike mesh-based methods that require costly meshing, or particle-based approaches that rely on discrete positional data, Gaussian Swaying models surfaces continuously with 3D Gaussians, enabling efficient and fine-grained aerodynamic interaction. Our framework unifies simulation and rendering on the same representation: Gaussian patches, which support force computation for dynamics while simultaneously providing normals for lightweight shading. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets across multiple metrics demonstrate that Gaussian Swaying achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for realistic aerodynamic scene simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether noise or low-quality neuroimaging data from large-scale datasets can contribute to developing domain foundation models or hinder their performance.

Method: The team performs pretraining using datasets of varying quality levels, followed by fine-tuning for brain age prediction using external datasets.

Result: Results highlight significant performance differences tied to data quality, pointing to the importance of curation and quality control for neuroimaging data.

Conclusion: Domain-specific curation is essential to bridge the gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards for developing trusted and effective foundation models.

Abstract: Large-scale brain imaging datasets provide unprecedented opportunities for developing domain foundation models through pretraining. However, unlike natural image datasets in computer vision, these neuroimaging data often exhibit high heterogeneity in quality, ranging from well-structured scans to severely distorted or incomplete brain volumes. This raises a fundamental question: can noise or low-quality scans contribute meaningfully to pretraining, or do they instead hinder model learning? In this study, we systematically explore the role of data quality level in pretraining and its impact on downstream tasks. Specifically, we perform pretraining on datasets with different quality levels and perform fine-tuning for brain age prediction on external cohorts. Our results show significant performance differences across quality levels, revealing both opportunities and limitations. We further discuss the gap between computer vision practices and clinical neuroimaging standards, emphasizing the necessity of domain-aware curation to ensure trusted and generalizable domain-specific foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval methods lack meaningful user-system interaction, failing to meet the personalization and dynamic needs of users in search processes.

Method: This paper introduces the IVCR task, a new retrieval paradigm enabling conversational interactions, supported by a bilingual dataset (IVCR-200K) and a framework using multi-modal large language models.

Result: Experiments validate the effectiveness of the IVCR-200K dataset and the proposed MLLM-based framework for interactive and personalized video retrieval.

Conclusion: Interactive and personalized retrieval systems can significantly improve user satisfaction. The paper's contributions pave the way for advanced conversational video retrieval mechanisms.

Abstract: In recent years, significant developments have been made in both video retrieval and video moment retrieval tasks, which respectively retrieve complete videos or moments for a given text query. These advancements have greatly improved user satisfaction during the search process. However, previous work has failed to establish meaningful "interaction" between the retrieval system and the user, and its one-way retrieval paradigm can no longer fully meet the personalization and dynamic needs of at least 80.8\% of users. In this paper, we introduce the Interactive Video Corpus Retrieval (IVCR) task, a more realistic setting that enables multi-turn, conversational, and realistic interactions between the user and the retrieval system. To facilitate research on this challenging task, we introduce IVCR-200K, a high-quality, bilingual, multi-turn, conversational, and abstract semantic dataset that supports video retrieval and even moment retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive framework based on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to help users interact in several modes with more explainable solutions. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TokenPure, a Diffusion Transformer framework for watermark removal in images while maintaining content consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving robust watermark removal alongside preserving the structural and perceptual quality of original content in the digital era.

Method: TokenPure uses token-based conditional generation by separating watermarked images into visual and structural tokens, which condition the diffusion process for reconstructing watermark-free images with high fidelity.

Result: TokenPure outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in watermark removal and reconstruction consistency across evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework establishes an effective solution for watermark removal, balancing robustness and content consistency through a novel tokenized conditional reconstruction approach.

Abstract: In the digital economy era, digital watermarking serves as a critical basis for ownership proof of massive replicable content, including AI-generated and other virtual assets. Designing robust watermarks capable of withstanding various attacks and processing operations is even more paramount. We introduce TokenPure, a novel Diffusion Transformer-based framework designed for effective and consistent watermark removal. TokenPure solves the trade-off between thorough watermark destruction and content consistency by leveraging token-based conditional reconstruction. It reframes the task as conditional generation, entirely bypassing the initial watermark-carrying noise. We achieve this by decomposing the watermarked image into two complementary token sets: visual tokens for texture and structural tokens for geometry. These tokens jointly condition the diffusion process, enabling the framework to synthesize watermark-free images with fine-grained consistency and structural integrity. Comprehensive experiments show that TokenPure achieves state-of-the-art watermark removal and reconstruction fidelity, substantially outperforming existing baselines in both perceptual quality and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety risks of Foreign Object Debris (FOD) in aircraft fuel tanks and the lack of datasets dedicated to these confined environments.

Method: The researchers created FOD-S2R, a dataset with 3,114 real and 3,137 synthetic HD images representing various configurations in a simulated aircraft fuel tank. They tested object detection models using this dataset to analyze how synthetic data enhances detection accuracy and generalizability.

Result: Benchmarking results demonstrated that synthetic data improves object detection accuracy and narrows the gap between simulation and real-world performance.

Conclusion: Synthetic data is effective in improving real-world detection performance in closed environments, providing a robust foundation for automated FOD detection in aviation maintenance.

Abstract: Foreign Object Debris (FOD) within aircraft fuel tanks presents critical safety hazards including fuel contamination, system malfunctions, and increased maintenance costs. Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance.

Motivation: To address the lack of focus on practical CFD applicability in current segmentation methods by introducing a dataset that ensures applicability in hemodynamic analyses.

Method: The authors develop the IAVS dataset, consisting of annotated 3D MRA images, a standardized CFD evaluation system, and propose a two-stage segmentation framework for aneurysm localization and fine-grained segmentation.

Result: A novel dataset and evaluation framework were created, enabling accurate segmentations that are practically applicable for CFD modeling, alongside a strong baseline model.

Conclusion: The dataset and tools presented improve the alignment of segmentation practices with CFD usage, aiming to benefit clinical and research applications in aneurysm analysis.

Abstract: The precise segmentation of intracranial aneurysms and their parent vessels (IA-Vessel) is a critical step for hemodynamic analyses, which mainly depends on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, current segmentation methods predominantly focus on image-based evaluation metrics, often neglecting their practical effectiveness in subsequent CFD applications. To address this deficiency, we present the Intracranial Aneurysm Vessel Segmentation (IAVS) dataset, the first comprehensive, multi-center collection comprising 641 3D MRA images with 587 annotations of aneurysms and IA-Vessels. In addition to image-mask pairs, IAVS dataset includes detailed hemodynamic analysis outcomes, addressing the limitations of existing datasets that neglect topological integrity and CFD applicability. To facilitate the development and evaluation of clinically relevant techniques, we construct two evaluation benchmarks including global localization of aneurysms (Stage I) and fine-grained segmentation of IA-Vessel (Stage II) and develop a simple and effective two-stage framework, which can be used as a out-of-the-box method and strong baseline. For comprehensive evaluation of applicability of segmentation results, we establish a standardized CFD applicability evaluation system that enables the automated and consistent conversion of segmentation masks into CFD models, offering an applicability-focused assessment of segmentation outcomes. The dataset, code, and model will be public available at https://github.com/AbsoluteResonance/IAVS.

Motivation: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, necessitating early risk assessment for timely interventions and prevention.

Method: Ensemble modeling with Random Forest, ExtraTrees, and XGBoost, combined with explainable AI (LIME analysis), feature engineering, and data pre-processing using Random Over-Sampling (ROS).

Result: The optimized ensemble model achieved 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD) and identified key risk factors: age, hypertension, and glucose levels.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that ensemble learning combined with explainable AI can provide accurate and interpretable stroke risk predictions, aiding in data-driven prevention and personalized healthcare strategies.

Abstract: Stroke is a major cause of death and permanent impairment, making it a major worldwide health concern. For prompt intervention and successful preventative tactics, early risk assessment is essential. To address this challenge, we used ensemble modeling and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to create an interpretable machine learning framework for stroke risk prediction. A thorough evaluation of 10 different machine learning models using 5-fold cross-validation across several datasets was part of our all-inclusive strategy, which also included feature engineering and data pretreatment (using Random Over-Sampling (ROS) to solve class imbalance). Our optimized ensemble model (Random Forest + ExtraTrees + XGBoost) performed exceptionally well, obtaining a strong 99.09% accuracy on the Stroke Prediction Dataset (SPD). We improved the model's transparency and clinical applicability by identifying three important clinical variables using LIME-based interpretability analysis: age, hypertension, and glucose levels. Through early prediction, this study highlights how combining ensemble learning with explainable AI (XAI) can deliver highly accurate and interpretable stroke risk assessment. By enabling data-driven prevention and personalized clinical decisions, our framework has the potential to transform stroke prediction and cardiovascular risk management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes AlignVid, a framework to improve text-guided image-to-video generation by addressing semantic negligence and enhancing prompt adherence through attention modulation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of semantic negligence in text-guided image-to-video generation, where existing methods fail to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially during significant transformations (e.g., adding, deleting, or modifying objects).

Method: The authors propose AlignVid, which includes Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM) for reweighting attention and Guidance Scheduling (GS) for selective application during transformer blocks and denoising. These techniques reduce semantic negligence while maintaining visual quality.

Result: AlignVid enhances prompt adherence and semantic fidelity in image-to-video generation. Alongside, the authors introduce OmitI2V, a benchmark for evaluating semantic negligence in TI2V tasks, featuring 367 annotated samples.

Conclusion: AlignVid improves semantic fidelity in TI2V generation with minimal intervention, and the OmitI2V benchmark aids in evaluating progress in addressing semantic negligence issues.

Abstract: Text-guided image-to-video (TI2V) generation has recently achieved remarkable progress, particularly in maintaining subject consistency and temporal coherence. However, existing methods still struggle to adhere to fine-grained prompt semantics, especially when prompts entail substantial transformations of the input image (e.g., object addition, deletion, or modification), a shortcoming we term semantic negligence. In a pilot study, we find that applying a Gaussian blur to the input image improves semantic adherence. Analyzing attention maps, we observe clearer foreground-background separation. From an energy perspective, this corresponds to a lower-entropy cross-attention distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce AlignVid, a training-free framework with two components: (i) Attention Scaling Modulation (ASM), which directly reweights attention via lightweight Q or K scaling, and (ii) Guidance Scheduling (GS), which applies ASM selectively across transformer blocks and denoising steps to reduce visual quality degradation. This minimal intervention improves prompt adherence while limiting aesthetic degradation. In addition, we introduce OmitI2V to evaluate semantic negligence in TI2V generation, comprising 367 human-annotated samples that span addition, deletion, and modification scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignVid can enhance semantic fidelity.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of generating high-quality Multi-Talker animated humans by introducing a large-scale dataset and a novel quality assessment framework called EvalTalker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality and user experience of Multi-Talker systems by addressing the limitations and quality degradation in current methods.

Method: The authors created the THQA-MT dataset with 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated Talking Humans from 15 techniques and designed EvalTalker, an evaluation framework that assesses global quality, human characteristics, identity consistency, and multimodal synchrony.

Result: EvalTalker demonstrated superior correlation with subjective quality scores, offering a significant improvement in evaluating Multi-Talker systems.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable dataset and framework for advancing the generation and assessment of high-quality Multi-Talker systems, setting the stage for future improvements in audiovisual communication.

Abstract: Speech-driven Talking Human (TH) generation, commonly known as "Talker," currently faces limitations in multi-subject driving capabilities. Extending this paradigm to "Multi-Talker," capable of animating multiple subjects simultaneously, introduces richer interactivity and stronger immersion in audiovisual communication. However, current Multi-Talkers still exhibit noticeable quality degradation caused by technical limitations, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. To address this challenge, we construct THQA-MT, the first large-scale Multi-Talker-generated Talking Human Quality Assessment dataset, consisting of 5,492 Multi-Talker-generated THs (MTHs) from 15 representative Multi-Talkers using 400 real portraits collected online. Through subjective experiments, we analyze perceptual discrepancies among different Multi-Talkers and identify 12 common types of distortion. Furthermore, we introduce EvalTalker, a novel TH quality assessment framework. This framework possesses the ability to perceive global quality, human characteristics, and identity consistency, while integrating Qwen-Sync to perceive multimodal synchrony. Experimental results demonstrate that EvalTalker achieves superior correlation with subjective scores, providing a robust foundation for future research on high-quality Multi-Talker generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InternVideo-Next, a video-text pretraining framework tackling issues in semantic coverage and shortcut learning by employing a novel Encoder-Predictor-Decoder design and a two-stage pretraining scheme with a diffusion decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortcomings of current video-text pretraining techniques that lack semantic coverage and fail to effectively integrate world knowledge, and improve masked video modeling's performance on general tasks.

Method: Proposes the Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework and a two-stage pretraining scheme. Stage 1 incorporates a conditional diffusion decoder to enhance semantic fidelity and convergence, while Stage 2 improves world knowledge learning by eliminating shortcut learning tendencies through a frozen latent space.

Result: InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks using only public, unlabeled videos, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for general video representation learning.

Conclusion: A scalable and effective solution for video-text pretraining is achieved by introducing InternVideo-Next, which bridges the gap between semantic understanding and pixel-level fidelity, enabling stronger video representation learning.

Abstract: Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the challenges of paragraph-level handwritten text recognition in low-resource languages like Hindi and Urdu, which often lack comprehensive linguistic resources and accurate OCR systems.

Method: The proposed method employs a Vision Transformer for visual feature extraction, a Transformer decoder for generating text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (RoBERTa) for refining output. The process involves implicit line segmentation and uses Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) for image modeling.

Result: The model achieved benchmark character recognition rates of 96.24% (NUST-UHWR), 92.05% (PUCIT-OUHL), 94.80% (Parimal-Urdu dataset), and 80.64% (Hindi dataset), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in Urdu text recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses challenges in handwritten text recognition for Hindi and Urdu, demonstrating its effectiveness by surpassing existing systems and setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in handwritten text recognition, paragraph-level handwritten text recognition, especially in low-resource languages, such as Hindi, Urdu and similar scripts, remains a challenging problem. These languages, often lacking comprehensive linguistic resources, require special attention to develop robust systems for accurate optical character recognition (OCR). This paper introduces BharatOCR, a novel segmentation-free paragraph-level handwritten Hindi and Urdu text recognition. We propose a ViT-Transformer Decoder-LM architecture for handwritten text recognition, where a Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts visual features, a Transformer decoder generates text sequences, and a pre-trained language model (LM) refines the output to improve accuracy, fluency, and coherence. Our model utilizes a Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) model proposed for masked image modeling in this research work. In addition, we adopt a RoBERTa architecture optimized for masked language modeling (MLM) to enhance the linguistic comprehension and generative capabilities of the proposed model. The transformer decoder generates text sequences from visual embeddings. This model is designed to iteratively process a paragraph image line by line, called implicit line segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated using our custom dataset ('Parimal Urdu') and ('Parimal Hindi'), introduced in this research work, as well as two public datasets. The proposed model achieved benchmark results in the NUST-UHWR, PUCIT-OUHL, and Parimal-Urdu datasets, achieving character recognition rates of 96.24%, 92.05%, and 94.80%, respectively. The model also provided benchmark results using the Hindi dataset achieving a character recognition rate of 80.64%. The results obtained from our proposed model indicated that it outperformed several state-of-the-art Urdu text recognition methods.

TL;DR: OpenBox is a two-stage pipeline for unsupervised 3D object detection, improving annotation quality and efficiency using 2D vision foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects in 3D object detection, crucial for autonomous driving safety and scalability.

Method: OpenBox uses 2D vision foundation models to align 2D and 3D data, categorizes objects by motion states, and creates adaptive bounding boxes without iterative self-training.

Result: Evaluation on multiple datasets (Waymo, Lyft Level 5, nuScenes) shows OpenBox enhances annotation accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: OpenBox addresses annotation challenges, streamlining unsupervised 3D detection with reduced overhead and better-quality results.

Abstract: Unsupervised and open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently gained attention, particularly in autonomous driving, where reducing annotation costs and recognizing unseen objects are critical for both safety and scalability. However, most existing approaches uniformly annotate 3D bounding boxes, ignore objects' physical states, and require multiple self-training iterations for annotation refinement, resulting in suboptimal quality and substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose OpenBox, a two-stage automatic annotation pipeline that leverages a 2D vision foundation model. In the first stage, OpenBox associates instance-level cues from 2D images processed by a vision foundation model with the corresponding 3D point clouds via cross-modal instance alignment. In the second stage, it categorizes instances by rigidity and motion state, then generates adaptive bounding boxes with class-specific size statistics. As a result, OpenBox produces high-quality 3D bounding box annotations without requiring self-training. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, the Lyft Level 5 Perception dataset, and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency over baselines.

Motivation: To improve road safety for pedestrians and cyclists by addressing the issue of undetected speeding vehicles approaching from behind.

Method: The method incorporates a 3D object tracking algorithm combining Kalman filter trajectory estimation and reinforcement learning-based image sampling. Head movements' impact is minimized by pitch and yaw angle correction to align the camera with the user's body.

Result: BlinkBud achieves lightweight, ultra-low power consumption (29.8 mW for earbuds and 702.6 mW for phones), and accurately detects hazards with false positive and false negative ratios of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

Conclusion: BlinkBud demonstrates effective hazard detection while being power-efficient and adaptive to constant head movements, making it a valuable contribution for improving road safety.

Abstract: Failing to be aware of speeding vehicles approaching from behind poses a huge threat to the road safety of pedestrians and cyclists. In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.

*Sheng Liu,Tianyu Luan,Phani Nuney,Xuelu Feng,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel 3D shape realism evaluation metric using a large language model (LLM) and introduces a dataset annotated with human realism scores to validate the metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for practical evaluation methods for 3D shape realism, independent of ground truth references, as demand for realistic 3D shapes increases in content creation domains.

Method: The method employs a mesh encoding to convert 3D shapes into language token space and uses a realism decoder to align LLM outputs with human perception. A new human-annotated dataset, RealismGrading, is also introduced.

Result: The proposed metric correlates well with human perception of 3D shape realism and outperforms existing methods in performance and generalizability.

Conclusion: The Shape-Realism Alignment Metric provides an effective way to evaluate 3D shape realism without ground truth, validated through extensive experiments and the new RealismGrading dataset.

Abstract: 3D generation and reconstruction techniques have been widely used in computer games, film, and other content creation areas. As the application grows, there is a growing demand for 3D shapes that look truly realistic. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a ground truth to measure mesh fidelity. However, in many practical cases, a shape's realism does not depend on having a ground truth reference. In this work, we propose a Shape-Realism Alignment Metric that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a bridge between mesh shape information and realism evaluation. To achieve this, we adopt a mesh encoding approach that converts 3D shapes into the language token space. A dedicated realism decoder is designed to align the language model's output with human perception of realism. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset, RealismGrading, which provides human-annotated realism scores without the need for ground truth shapes. Our dataset includes shapes generated by 16 different algorithms on over a dozen objects, making it more representative of practical 3D shape distributions. We validate our metric's performance and generalizability through k-fold cross-validation across different objects. Experimental results show that our metric correlates well with human perceptions and outperforms existing methods, and has good generalizability.

### [348] [Textured Geometry Evaluation: Perceptual 3D Textured Shape Metric via 3D Latent-Geometry Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01380)
*Tianyu Luan,Xuelu Feng,Zixin Zhu,Phani Nuney,Sheng Liu,Xuan Gong,David Doermann,Chunming Qiao,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces the Textured Geometry Evaluation (TGE) method for evaluating 3D textured mesh fidelity directly, overcoming limitations of rendering-based and geometry-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D model evaluation, like Chamfer Distance and learning-based metrics, don't align well with human evaluations due to incomplete structural coverage, viewpoint sensitivity, and domain gaps caused by synthetic distortions.

Method: The authors developed TGE, which evaluates fidelity by jointly using geometry and color information of textured 3D meshes without relying on rendering. They also built a human-annotated dataset featuring real-world distortions for training and evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that TGE surpasses both rendering-based and geometry-only metrics on datasets containing real-world distortions.

Conclusion: The proposed TGE method is more aligned with human evaluations and effectively addresses shortcomings in current methods, improving fidelity evaluation for 3D textured models.

Abstract: Textured high-fidelity 3D models are crucial for games, AR/VR, and film, but human-aligned evaluation methods still fall behind despite recent advances in 3D reconstruction and generation. Existing metrics, such as Chamfer Distance, often fail to align with how humans evaluate the fidelity of 3D shapes. Recent learning-based metrics attempt to improve this by relying on rendered images and 2D image quality metrics. However, these approaches face limitations due to incomplete structural coverage and sensitivity to viewpoint choices. Moreover, most methods are trained on synthetic distortions, which differ significantly from real-world distortions, resulting in a domain gap. To address these challenges, we propose a new fidelity evaluation method that is based directly on 3D meshes with texture, without relying on rendering. Our method, named Textured Geometry Evaluation TGE, jointly uses the geometry and color information to calculate the fidelity of the input textured mesh with comparison to a reference colored shape. To train and evaluate our metric, we design a human-annotated dataset with real-world distortions. Experiments show that TGE outperforms rendering-based and geometry-only methods on real-world distortion dataset.

### [349] [Reversible Inversion for Training-Free Exemplar-guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01382)
*Yuke Li,Lianli Gao,Ji Zhang,Pengpeng Zeng,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen,Heng Tao Shen,Jingkuan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Reversible Inversion (ReInversion), a novel training-free approach using a two-stage denoising process and Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) for efficient and effective Exemplar-guided Image Editing (EIE) with minimal computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiency and quality issues in training-free image editing approaches and eliminate dependence on computationally expensive large-scale pre-training methods.

Method: Proposes ReInversion, a two-stage denoising process conditioned on source and reference images, alongside Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) to preserve background structural consistency.

Result: Demonstrates superior Exemplar-guided Image Editing performance, both qualitative and quantitative, with the lowest computational requirement compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ReInversion offers a significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness, providing state-of-the-art image editing results without relying on expensive pre-training.

Abstract: Exemplar-guided Image Editing (EIE) aims to modify a source image according to a visual reference. Existing approaches often require large-scale pre-training to learn relationships between the source and reference images, incurring high computational costs. As a training-free alternative, inversion techniques can be used to map the source image into a latent space for manipulation. However, our empirical study reveals that standard inversion is sub-optimal for EIE, leading to poor quality and inefficiency. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Reversible Inversion ({ReInversion})} for effective and efficient EIE. Specifically, ReInversion operates as a two-stage denoising process, which is first conditioned on the source image and subsequently on the reference. Besides, we introduce a Mask-Guided Selective Denoising (MSD) strategy to constrain edits to target regions, preserving the structural consistency of the background. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our ReInversion method achieves state-of-the-art EIE performance with the lowest computational overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PointNet4D, a lightweight 4D network for processing real-time point cloud video using a novel temporal fusion block and pretraining strategy, achieving significant improvements over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient systems capable of processing streaming 4D data (3D space evolving over time) in real-time for robotic and interactive systems, under resource constraints.

Method: PointNet4D integrates a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer block for temporal fusion, supporting variable-length sequences, and uses a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy (4DMAP) for motion cue understanding.

Result: PointNet4D showed consistent improvements across 9 tasks on 7 datasets and excelled in robotic applications like 4D Diffusion Policy and Imitation Learning for benchmarks like RoboTwin and HandoverSim.

Conclusion: PointNet4D demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency as a 4D backbone for real-time and offline applications, providing a robust solution to dynamic environment modeling and robotic tasks.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D environments-3D space evolving over time-is critical for robotic and interactive systems. These applications demand systems that can process streaming point cloud video in real-time, often under resource constraints, while also benefiting from past and present observations when available. However, current 4D backbone networks rely heavily on spatiotemporal convolutions and Transformers, which are often computationally intensive and poorly suited to real-time applications. We propose PointNet4D, a lightweight 4D backbone optimized for both online and offline settings. At its core is a Hybrid Mamba-Transformer temporal fusion block, which integrates the efficient state-space modeling of Mamba and the bidirectional modeling power of Transformers. This enables PointNet4D to handle variable-length online sequences efficiently across different deployment scenarios. To enhance temporal understanding, we introduce 4DMAP, a frame-wise masked auto-regressive pretraining strategy that captures motion cues across frames. Our extensive evaluations across 9 tasks on 7 datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements across diverse domains. We further demonstrate PointNet4D's utility by building two robotic application systems: 4D Diffusion Policy and 4D Imitation Learning, achieving substantial gains on the RoboTwin and HandoverSim benchmarks.

### [351] [FRAMER: Frequency-Aligned Self-Distillation with Adaptive Modulation Leveraging Diffusion Priors for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01390)
*Seungho Choi,Jeahun Sung,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FRAMER, a training scheme to enhance real-image super-resolution by leveraging diffusion priors, improving perceptual quality and reconstruction metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome shortcomings in diffusion models, such as low-frequency bias and insufficient high-frequency detail reconstruction in real-image super-resolution tasks.

Method: FRAMER employs diffusion priors, splits features into low/high-frequency bands using FFT masks, and introduces contrastive losses (IntraCL and InterCL) along with adaptive modulators (FAW and FAM) for guided training.

Result: FRAMER improves key performance metrics (PSNR, SSIM) and perceptual scores (e.g., LPIPS, NIQE) across different model backbones, including U-Net and Stable Diffusion versions.

Conclusion: FRAMER enhances real-image super-resolution by addressing frequency hierarchy issues, validating its robustness through extensive experiments on multiple backbones and ablation studies.

Abstract: Real-image super-resolution (Real-ISR) seeks to recover HR images from LR inputs with mixed, unknown degradations. While diffusion models surpass GANs in perceptual quality, they under-reconstruct high-frequency (HF) details due to a low-frequency (LF) bias and a depth-wise "low-first, high-later" hierarchy. We introduce FRAMER, a plug-and-play training scheme that exploits diffusion priors without changing the backbone or inference. At each denoising step, the final-layer feature map teaches all intermediate layers. Teacher and student feature maps are decomposed into LF/HF bands via FFT masks to align supervision with the model's internal frequency hierarchy. For LF, an Intra Contrastive Loss (IntraCL) stabilizes globally shared structure. For HF, an Inter Contrastive Loss (InterCL) sharpens instance-specific details using random-layer and in-batch negatives. Two adaptive modulators, Frequency-based Adaptive Weight (FAW) and Frequency-based Alignment Modulation (FAM), reweight per-layer LF/HF signals and gate distillation by current similarity. Across U-Net and DiT backbones (e.g., Stable Diffusion 2, 3), FRAMER consistently improves PSNR/SSIM and perceptual metrics (LPIPS, NIQE, MANIQA, MUSIQ). Ablations validate the final-layer teacher and random-layer negatives.

*Tushar Pranav,Eshan Pandey,Austria Lyka Diane Bala,Aman Chadha,Indriyati Atmosukarto,Donny Soh Cheng Lock*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RICE-VL, a benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) cultural understanding in Southeast Asia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the Western-centric biases of VLMs, ensuring they are effective in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia.

Method: The authors created RICE-VL, comprising 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering samples and 1,000 Visual Grounding pairs, annotated by SEA experts. They introduced SEA-LAVE metric for evaluation considering cultural alignment.

Result: Evaluations on six VLMs highlight significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and in comprehending abstract cultural domains. Visual Grounding reveals model limitations in understanding culturally significant scene elements.

Conclusion: RICE-VL demonstrates the need for inclusive development of VLMs to improve cultural comprehension and better serve global populations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in multimodal tasks but often exhibit Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this, we introduce RICE-VL, a novel benchmark evaluating VLM cultural understanding across 11 ASEAN countries. RICE-VL includes over 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples -- covering True or False, Fill-in-the-Blank, and open-ended formats -- and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts across 14 sub-ground categories. We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations.

*Yongkun Du,Miaomiao Zhao,Songlin Fan,Zhineng Chen,Caiyan Jia,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mask Diffusion Models (MDMs) for Scene Text Recognition (STR), proposing MDiff4STR with strategies to address performance gaps and achieving superior results compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Scene Text Recognition (STR) by leveraging MDMs as an efficient and accurate alternative to auto-regressive models (ARMs), addressing their current limitations in accuracy.

Method: The authors propose MDiff4STR, integrating six noising strategies to align training with inference and a token-replacement noise mechanism to combat overconfident predictions.

Result: MDiff4STR consistently surpasses state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy across various STR benchmarks, including challenging scenarios, while maintaining fast inference with minimal denoising steps.

Conclusion: MDiff4STR demonstrates the potential of MDMs in STR tasks, achieving a robust balance between efficiency and accuracy, and serves as a promising approach for future research and application in the field.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion Models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive models (ARMs) for vision-language tasks, owing to their flexible balance of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce MDMs into the Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. We show that vanilla MDM lags behind ARMs in terms of accuracy, although it improves recognition efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose MDiff4STR, a Mask Diffusion model enhanced with two key improvement strategies tailored for STR. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in applying MDMs to STR: noising gap between training and inference, and overconfident predictions during inference. Both significantly hinder the performance of MDMs. To mitigate the first issue, we develop six noising strategies that better align training with inference behavior. For the second, we propose a token-replacement noise mechanism that provides a non-mask noise type, encouraging the model to reconsider and revise overly confident but incorrect predictions. We conduct extensive evaluations of MDiff4STR on both standard and challenging STR benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios including irregular, artistic, occluded, and Chinese text, as well as whether the use of pretraining. Across these settings, MDiff4STR consistently outperforms popular STR models, surpassing state-of-the-art ARMs in accuracy, while maintaining fast inference with only three denoising steps.

### [354] [\textit{ViRectify}: A Challenging Benchmark for Video Reasoning Correction with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01424)
*Xusen Hei,Jiali Chen,Jinyu Yang,Mengchen Zhao,Yi Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViRectify, a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) error correction capabilities in video reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models struggle with complex video reasoning tasks, and there is a lack of systematic tools to evaluate and improve their ability to identify and rectify errors.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark named ViRectify, featuring a dataset of over 30K instances derived through AI-assisted annotation and human verification. They propose a trajectory evidence-driven correction framework for error identification and correction.

Result: Extensive testing shows that GPT-5 achieves only 31.94% correction accuracy on ViRectify, while their proposed framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B model to outperform 72B variants, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: ViRectify is a valuable benchmark for assessing MLLM error correction and opens new avenues for improving and evaluating video reasoning in advanced MLLMs.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors in complex video reasoning scenarios, correcting these errors is critical for uncovering their weaknesses and improving performance. However, existing benchmarks lack systematic evaluation of MLLMs' ability to identify and correct these video reasoning errors. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{ViRectify}, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their fine-grained correction capability. Through an AI-assisted annotation pipeline with human verification, we construct a dataset of over 30\textit{K} instances spanning dynamic perception, scientific reasoning, and embodied decision-making domains. In \textit{ViRectify}, we challenge MLLMs to perform step-wise error identification and generate rationales with key video evidence grounding. In addition, we further propose the trajectory evidence-driven correction framework, comprising step-wise error trajectory and reward modeling on visual evidence-grounded correction. It encourages the model to explicitly concentrate on error propagation and key timestamps for correction. Extensive evaluation across 16 advanced MLLMs demonstrates that our \textit{ViRectify} serves as a challenging testbed, where GPT-5 achieves only 31.94\% correction accuracy. Our framework enables a Qwen2.5-VL-7B to consistently outperform the variants of 72B on \textit{ViRectify}, showing the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis uncovers systematic asymmetries in error correction across models, and our dataset is also a valuable data resource to perform reflection learning. We believe \textit{ViRectify} provides a new direction for comprehensively evaluating the advanced MLLMs in video reasoning.

*Yiyang Ma,Feng Zhou,Xuedan Yin,Pu Cao,Yonghao Dang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResDiT proposes a method to enhance resolution in pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) without re-training, focusing on spatial layout accuracy and texture fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issues of spatial layout collapse and poor texture fidelity in high-resolution image synthesis using pre-trained Diffusion Transformers.

Method: Introduces position embedding (PE) scaling to rectify incorrect positional encoding and a local-enhancement mechanism for improving details, combined with a patch-level fusion module and Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy.

Result: ResDiT achieves consistent high-fidelity high-resolution image generation and supports tasks like spatially controlled generation.

Conclusion: ResDiT simplifies the process of achieving high-resolution image synthesis while maintaining fidelity, integrating seamlessly with other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-resolution (HR) image synthesis often leads to spatial layout collapse and degraded texture fidelity. Prior work mitigates these issues with complex pipelines that first perform a base-resolution (i.e., training-resolution) denoising process to guide HR generation. We instead explore the intrinsic generative mechanisms of DiTs and propose ResDiT, a training-free method that scales resolution efficiently. We identify the core factor governing spatial layout, position embeddings (PEs), and show that the original PEs encode incorrect positional information when extrapolated to HR, which triggers layout collapse. To address this, we introduce a PE scaling technique that rectifies positional encoding under resolution changes. To further remedy low-fidelity details, we develop a local-enhancement mechanism grounded in base-resolution local attention. We design a patch-level fusion module that aggregates global and local cues, together with a Gaussian-weighted splicing strategy that eliminates grid artifacts. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ResDiT consistently delivers high-fidelity, high-resolution image synthesis and integrates seamlessly with downstream tasks, including spatially controlled generation.

*Klara Reichard,Nikolas Brasch,Nassir Navab,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clipomaly enhances autonomous driving systems by enabling open-world and anomaly segmentation with semantically meaningful labeling for unknown regions. It uses CLIP's image-text embedding to detect and name unknown objects without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inability of existing methods to assign meaningful labels to unknown regions and to improve the distinction and representation learning of unknown classes during segmentation in autonomous driving systems.

Method: The paper introduces Clipomaly, a zero-shot, CLIP-based approach leveraging shared image-text embeddings. It dynamically extends its vocabulary during inference, enabling segmentation and naming of unknown objects without anomaly-specific training.

Result: Clipomaly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on anomaly segmentation benchmarks and effectively assigns human-readable labels to anomalies, enhancing practicality.

Conclusion: Clipomaly represents a significant step forward in anomaly segmentation for autonomous driving by combining interpretability, flexibility, and robust performance, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Open-world and anomaly segmentation methods seek to enable autonomous driving systems to detect and segment both known and unknown objects in real-world scenes. However, existing methods do not assign semantically meaningful labels to unknown regions, and distinguishing and learning representations for unknown classes remains difficult. While open-vocabulary segmentation methods show promise in generalizing to novel classes, they require a fixed inference vocabulary and thus cannot be directly applied to anomaly segmentation where unknown classes are unconstrained. We propose Clipomaly, the first CLIP-based open-world and anomaly segmentation method for autonomous driving. Our zero-shot approach requires no anomaly-specific training data and leverages CLIP's shared image-text embedding space to both segment unknown objects and assign human-interpretable names to them. Unlike open-vocabulary methods, our model dynamically extends its vocabulary at inference time without retraining, enabling robust detection and naming of anomalies beyond common class definitions such as those in Cityscapes. Clipomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on established anomaly segmentation benchmarks while providing interpretability and flexibility essential for practical deployment.

*Jian Shu,Nanjie Yao,Gangjian Zhang,Junlong Ren,Yu Feng,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified learning-based framework to improve 3D human avatar animation by addressing inefficiencies in template construction and structural distortions in pose deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in 3D human avatar animation, specifically inefficiencies in canonical template construction and distortions caused by standard deformation methods like LBS.

Method: A U-Net architecture is used to generate texture-decoupled human templates efficiently, and a data-driven refinement technique is applied to enhance structural integrity during pose transformation.

Result: The model demonstrates consistent performance across various poses, achieving a balance of efficiency and quality, and surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances the field of 3D human avatar animation by optimizing template generation and pose deformation, contributing to higher realism and better efficiency.

Abstract: 3D human avatar animation aims at transforming a human avatar from an arbitrary initial pose to a specified target pose using deformation algorithms. Existing approaches typically divide this task into two stages: canonical template construction and target pose deformation. However, current template construction methods demand extensive skeletal rigging and often produce artifacts for specific poses. Moreover, target pose deformation suffers from structural distortions caused by Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), which significantly undermines animation realism. To address these problems, we propose a unified learning-based framework to address both challenges in two phases. For the former phase, to overcome the inefficiencies and artifacts during template construction, we leverage a U-Net architecture that decouples texture and pose information in a feed-forward process, enabling fast generation of a human template. For the latter phase, we propose a data-driven refinement technique that enhances structural integrity. Extensive experiments show that our model delivers consistent performance across diverse poses with an optimal balance between efficiency and quality,surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Omer Sela,Michael Chertok,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CourtMotion is a framework for analyzing and predicting basketball game events using a combination of Graph Neural Networks and Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the understanding and prediction of basketball events by addressing limitations in traditional methods that rely solely on player positions and fail to analyze detailed motion patterns and game contexts effectively.

Method: CourtMotion employs a two-stage approach: Graph Neural Networks analyze player skeletal tracking data to understand motion patterns, and Transformer architectures model player interactions, with event projection heads linking motions to game events.

Result: The method achieved a 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-only models, along with significant performance gains in various basketball analytics tasks like pick detection and shot type recognition.

Conclusion: CourtMotion effectively connects physical motion patterns with tactical basketball purposes, establishing itself as a powerful foundational tool for a wide range of basketball analytics applications.

Abstract: This paper presents CourtMotion, a spatiotemporal modeling framework for analyzing and predicting game events and plays as they develop in professional basketball. Anticipating basketball events requires understanding both physical motion patterns and their semantic significance in the context of the game. Traditional approaches that use only player positions fail to capture crucial indicators such as body orientation, defensive stance, or shooting preparation motions. Our two-stage approach first processes skeletal tracking data through Graph Neural Networks to capture nuanced motion patterns, then employs a Transformer architecture with specialized attention mechanisms to model player interactions. We introduce event projection heads that explicitly connect player movements to basketball events like passes, shots, and steals, training the model to associate physical motion patterns with their tactical purposes. Experiments on NBA tracking data demonstrate significant improvements over position-only baselines: 35% reduction in trajectory prediction error compared to state-of-the-art position-based models and consistent performance gains across key basketball analytics tasks. The resulting pretrained model serves as a powerful foundation for multiple downstream tasks, with pick detection, shot taker identification, assist prediction, shot location classification, and shot type recognition demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.

TL;DR: ChronosObserver is a training-free model developed to generate high-fidelity, 3D-consistent, and time-synchronized multi-view videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to overcome challenges in generating 3D-consistent and time-synchronized multi-view videos using prevailing camera-controlled video models, which often face generalization and scalability issues.

Method: ChronosObserver utilizes a World State Hyperspace to encode spatiotemporal constraints and Hyperspace Guided Sampling for synchronization of multiple viewpoints in diffusion sampling, without requiring training or fine-tuning.

Result: The model demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality, synchronized multi-view videos without the need for additional training or optimization.

Conclusion: ChronosObserver provides a scalable and generalizable solution for 4D scene video generation while eliminating the dependence on training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Although prevailing camera-controlled video generation models can produce cinematic results, lifting them directly to the generation of 3D-consistent and high-fidelity time-synchronized multi-view videos remains challenging, which is a pivotal capability for taming 4D worlds. Some works resort to data augmentation or test-time optimization, but these strategies are constrained by limited model generalization and scalability issues. To this end, we propose ChronosObserver, a training-free method including World State Hyperspace to represent the spatiotemporal constraints of a 4D world scene, and Hyperspace Guided Sampling to synchronize the diffusion sampling trajectories of multiple views using the hyperspace. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity and 3D-consistent time-synchronized multi-view videos generation without training or fine-tuning for diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mostly unsupervised method for extracting curves and 1D structures from images, addressing challenges in curve inference and endpoint connection.

Method: A bi-level minimization approach is designed using discretized energy and Smirnov's decomposition theorem. The method is further enhanced via curvature-dependent energies in a lifted space with sub-Riemannian or Finslerian metrics.

Result: The developed approach offers a computational framework for curve extraction that integrates energy minimization and curvature-based techniques.

Conclusion: This work provides a new, largely unsupervised methodology for curve and 1D structure extraction, with advanced handling of curvature through sophisticated mathematical tools.

Abstract: We introduce a variational approach for extracting curves between a list of possible endpoints, based on the discretization of an energy and Smirnov's decomposition theorem for vector fields. It is used to design a bi-level minimization approach to automatically extract curves and 1D structures from an image, which is mostly unsupervised. We extend then the method to curvature-dependent energies, using a now classical lifting of the curves in the space of positions and orientations equipped with an appropriate sub-Riemanian or Finslerian metric.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELVIS, a framework designed to improve video instance segmentation (VIS) performance in low-light conditions through unsupervised synthetic video pipelines and a novel model structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light video segmentation is highly challenging due to noise, blur, and low contrast. The lack of annotated datasets and limitations in existing synthetic methods further hinder progress, along with the poor performance of current VIS methods in degraded conditions.

Method: The authors propose ELVIS, which incorporates an unsupervised synthetic low-light video pipeline to model spatial and temporal degradations, a VDP-Net to synthesize degradation profiles, and an enhancement decoder head to separate degradations from content.

Result: Testing on synthetic low-light YouTube-VIS 2019 dataset demonstrated that ELVIS improved performance by up to +3.7AP, enhancing the domain adaptation of VIS models to low-light scenarios.

Conclusion: ELVIS provides a significant improvement in low-light video segmentation by addressing both spatial and temporal degradation challenges, marking progress in VIS domain adaptation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) for low-light content remains highly challenging for both humans and machines alike, due to adverse imaging conditions including noise, blur and low-contrast. The lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the limitations of current synthetic pipelines, particularly in modeling temporal degradations, further hinder progress. Moreover, existing VIS methods are not robust to the degradations found in low-light videos and, as a result, perform poorly even when finetuned on low-light data. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ELVIS} (\textbf{E}nhance \textbf{L}ow-light for \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation), a novel framework that enables effective domain adaptation of state-of-the-art VIS models to low-light scenarios.

*Franz Thaler,Martin Urschler,Mateusz Kozinski,Matthias AF Gsell,Gernot Plank,Darko Stern*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SRCSM method to address single-source domain generalization for medical image segmentation, aiming for direct application across domains without new domain data during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable a segmentation model trained on one domain (e.g., CT) to generalize directly to another domain (e.g., MR) without requiring additional data or annotations from the target domain.

Method: The proposed method, SRCSM, incorporates semantic-aware random convolution to augment source images differently based on label annotations and maps target image intensity to align with source domain features during testing.

Result: SRCSM achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modality and cross-center generalization tests for medical segmentation tasks and rivals in-domain baselines in several challenging settings.

Conclusion: SRCSM demonstrates high generalization capability and sets a new standard for domain generalization in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: We tackle the challenging problem of single-source domain generalization (DG) for medical image segmentation. To this end, we aim for training a network on one domain (e.g., CT) and directly apply it to a different domain (e.g., MR) without adapting the model and without requiring images or annotations from the new domain during training. We propose a novel method for promoting DG when training deep segmentation networks, which we call SRCSM. During training, our method diversifies the source domain through semantic-aware random convolution, where different regions of a source image are augmented differently, based on their annotation labels. At test-time, we complement the randomization of the training domain via mapping the intensity of target domain images, making them similar to source domain data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on a variety of cross-modality and cross-center generalization settings for abdominal, whole-heart and prostate segmentation, where we outperform previous DG techniques in a vast majority of experiments. Additionally, we also investigate our method when training on whole-heart CT or MR data and testing on the diastolic and systolic phase of cine MR data captured with different scanner hardware, where we make a step towards closing the domain gap in this even more challenging setting. Overall, our evaluation shows that SRCSM can be considered a new state-of-the-art in DG for medical image segmentation and, moreover, even achieves a segmentation performance that matches the performance of the in-domain baseline in several settings.

*Can Polat,Erchin Serpedin,Mustafa Kurban,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuantumCanvas, a benchmark for machine learning models to capture local quantum interactions between atomic pairs using multimedia data and visual representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of physical transferability in molecular and materials machine learning, as existing models focus on molecule-level patterns rather than fundamental two-body quantum interactions.

Method: Introduced QuantumCanvas, a multimodal dataset with quantum properties for 2,850 atomic pairs, leveraging physically grounded image representations and benchmarking diverse architectures for their predictive accuracy.

Result: QuantumCanvas enabled better predictive performance in evaluating quantum system properties using visual and numerical modalities. Pretraining improved stability and efficiency on downstream quantum datasets.

Conclusion: QuantumCanvas bridges orbital physics with visuals to create interpretable machine learning models that generalize quantum interactions, encouraging advancements in material and molecular quantum studies.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities.

*Hailong Yang,Te Zhang,Kup-sze Choi,Zhaohong Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a multi-path diffusion model aimed at improving image generation quality and efficiency using fuzzy rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffuse models excel at generating high-resolution images but struggle to handle collections with diverse features, leading to inefficiencies and computational challenges. This paper seeks to overcome these limitations.

Method: DFS incorporates latent-space multi-path diffusion guided by fuzzy rules, utilizing feature-specific paths, rule-chain reasoning for coordination, and fuzzy membership-based compression to optimize performance.

Result: Tests on LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO datasets show DFS ensures stable training, faster convergence, superior image-text alignment, and improved image quality compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: DFS effectively addresses the challenges of heterogeneous image features and computational inefficiencies, demonstrating advancements over current multi-path and single-path diffusion methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading technique for generating images due to their ability to create high-resolution and realistic images. Despite their strong performance, diffusion models still struggle in managing image collections with significant feature differences. They often fail to capture complex features and produce conflicting results. Research has attempted to address this issue by learning different regions of an image through multiple diffusion paths and then combining them. However, this approach leads to inefficient coordination among multiple paths and high computational costs. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a Diffusion Fuzzy System (DFS), a latent-space multi-path diffusion model guided by fuzzy rules. DFS offers several advantages. First, unlike traditional multi-path diffusion methods, DFS uses multiple diffusion paths, each dedicated to learning a specific class of image features. By assigning each path to a different feature type, DFS overcomes the limitations of multi-path models in capturing heterogeneous image features. Second, DFS employs rule-chain-based reasoning to dynamically steer the diffusion process and enable efficient coordination among multiple paths. Finally, DFS introduces a fuzzy membership-based latent-space compression mechanism to reduce the computational costs of multi-path diffusion effectively. We tested our method on three public datasets: LSUN Bedroom, LSUN Church, and MS COCO. The results show that DFS achieves more stable training and faster convergence than existing single-path and multi-path diffusion models. Additionally, DFS surpasses baseline models in both image quality and alignment between text and images, and also shows improved accuracy when comparing generated images to target references.

### [365] [Deep Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain Imaging: Large-Scale Benchmarking and Bias Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01534)
*Alexander Frotscher,Christian F. Baumgartner,Thomas Wolfers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper provides a large-scale benchmark on deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain MRI with a systematic evaluation of methods, highlighting variability in segmentation performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical translation of deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRIs by addressing fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics.

Method: A benchmark study using 5,948 healthy scans for training, 92 scans for validation, and 3,483 scans for testing, evaluating algorithm performance and robustness in varied conditions.

Result: Dice-based segmentation performance varied significantly across algorithms, with reconstruction-based methods showing stronger segmentation and feature-based methods demonstrating better robustness under shifts. Observed biases include scanner-related effects, missed small and low-contrast lesions, and age/sex-related false positives.

Conclusion: The benchmark underscores algorithmic limitations and suggests priorities including native image pretraining, principled metrics, fairness-aware modeling, and domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Abstract: Deep unsupervised anomaly detection in brain magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising route to identify pathological deviations without requiring lesion-specific annotations. Yet, fragmented evaluations, heterogeneous datasets, and inconsistent metrics have hindered progress toward clinical translation. Here, we present a large-scale, multi-center benchmark of deep unsupervised anomaly detection for brain imaging. The training cohort comprised 2,976 T1 and 2,972 T2-weighted scans from healthy individuals across six scanners, with ages ranging from 6 to 89 years. Validation used 92 scans to tune hyperparameters and estimate unbiased thresholds. Testing encompassed 2,221 T1w and 1,262 T2w scans spanning healthy datasets and diverse clinical cohorts. Across all algorithms, the Dice-based segmentation performance varied between 0.03 and 0.65, indicating substantial variability. To assess robustness, we systematically evaluated the impact of different scanners, lesion types and sizes, as well as demographics (age, sex). Reconstruction-based methods, particularly diffusion-inspired approaches, achieved the strongest lesion segmentation performance, while feature-based methods showed greater robustness under distributional shifts. However, systematic biases, such as scanner-related effects, were observed for the majority of algorithms, including that small and low-contrast lesions were missed more often, and that false positives varied with age and sex. Increasing healthy training data yields only modest gains, underscoring that current unsupervised anomaly detection frameworks are limited algorithmically rather than by data availability. Our benchmark establishes a transparent foundation for future research and highlights priorities for clinical translation, including image native pretraining, principled deviation measures, fairness-aware modeling, and robust domain adaptation.

*Zipeng Wang,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlashVGGT, a model for 3D reconstruction that improves scalability and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods by using a descriptor-based attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability and inefficiency issues of current 3D reconstruction models like VGGT, caused by quadratic complexity of self-attention and large input sequences.

Method: FlashVGGT introduces a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Spatial information is compressed into compact descriptor tokens for cross-attention, and also supports online inference via chunk-recursive mechanisms using cached descriptors.

Result: FlashVGGT performs comparably to VGGT in reconstruction accuracy while significantly reducing inference time to 9.3% of VGGT's for 1,000 images, and additionally scales to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

Conclusion: FlashVGGT effectively resolves scalability bottlenecks in multi-view 3D reconstruction with a novel attention mechanism, maintaining accuracy while reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for head-and-neck lesions mostly focus on malignant conditions, overlooking other types like cysts. This creates a need for diverse datasets and improved segmentation methods for better analysis.

Method: The authors created MasHeNe with annotated contrast-enhanced CT scans and designed the WEMF model, using tri-window enhancement and multi-frequency attention within a U-shaped backbone for improved segmentation.

Result: The WEMF model achieved Dice: 70.45%, IoU: 66.89%, NSD: 72.33%, and HD95: 5.12 mm on the MasHeNe dataset, outperforming evaluated methods.

Conclusion: MasHeNe serves as a robust benchmark for diverse head-and-neck mass segmentation, and the WEMF model demonstrates strong potential for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Head and neck masses are space-occupying lesions that can compress the airway and esophagus and may affect nerves and blood vessels. Available public datasets primarily focus on malignant lesions and often overlook other space-occupying conditions in this region. To address this gap, we introduce MasHeNe, an initial dataset of 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices that includes both tumors and cysts with pixel-level annotations. We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets. The observed error patterns also suggest that this task remains challenging and requires further research. Our dataset and code are available at https://github.com/drthaodao3101/MasHeNe.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent depth misalignment in OBM microresistivity imager operations, even after velocity correction.

Method: The paper applies the ShapeDTW algorithm, enhanced with a feature set combining the 1D Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and original signals, for sensitive morphological alignment.

Result: Field tests show that the method achieves precise alignment for complex textures, depth shifts, and local scaling.

Conclusion: The method effectively resolves depth alignment issues and provides a flexible framework for integrating geological feature-specific descriptors.

Abstract: In well logging operations using the oil-based mud (OBM) microresistivity imager, which employs an interleaved design with upper and lower pad sets, depth misalignment issues persist between the pad images even after velocity correction. This paper presents a depth matching method for borehole images based on the Shape Dynamic Time Warping (ShapeDTW) algorithm. The method extracts local shape features to construct a morphologically sensitive distance matrix, better preserving structural similarity between sequences during alignment. We implement this by employing a combined feature set of the one-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG1D) and the original signal as the shape descriptor. Field test examples demonstrate that our method achieves precise alignment for images with complex textures, depth shifts, or local scaling. Furthermore, it provides a flexible framework for feature extension, allowing the integration of other descriptors tailored to specific geological features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of supervised CIR methods, such as the reliance on costly annotations, and the ineffectiveness of existing zero-shot solutions in bridging the vision-language modality gap.

Method: The proposed Fusion-Diff framework employs a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy in a joint vision-language space, combined with a lightweight Control-Adapter for fine-tuning on a small synthetic dataset.

Result: Fusion-Diff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on CIR benchmarks like CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO, surpassing prior zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: Fusion-Diff demonstrates improved interpretability and performance in ZS-CIR, showing its capability as an efficient and effective multimodal alignment strategy.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables fine-grained visual search by combining a reference image with a textual modification. While supervised CIR methods achieve high accuracy, their reliance on costly triplet annotations motivates zero-shot solutions. The core challenge in zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) stems from a fundamental dilemma: existing text-centric or diffusion-based approaches struggle to effectively bridge the vision-language modality gap. To address this, we propose Fusion-Diff, a novel generative editing framework with high effectiveness and data efficiency designed for multimodal alignment. First, it introduces a multimodal fusion feature editing strategy within a joint vision-language (VL) space, substantially narrowing the modality gap. Second, to maximize data efficiency, the framework incorporates a lightweight Control-Adapter, enabling state-of-the-art performance through fine-tuning on only a limited-scale synthetic dataset of 200K samples. Extensive experiments on standard CIR benchmarks (CIRR, FashionIQ, and CIRCO) demonstrate that Fusion-Diff significantly outperforms prior zero-shot approaches. We further enhance the interpretability of our model by visualizing the fused multimodal representations.

Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive understanding and guidelines for crafting efficient Test-Time Training (TTT) designs for visual sequence modeling.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic empirical study to derive design principles for effective visual TTT. They then proposed ViT$^3$, a visual TTT model with a pure TTT architecture achieving linear complexity and parallelized computation.

Result: ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms other advanced linear-complexity models in visual tasks such as image classification, generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation, narrowing the performance gap with vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for designing visual TTT models and introduces ViT$^3$, a scalable and effective framework, serving as a baseline for future TTT-focused research.

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) has recently emerged as a promising direction for efficient sequence modeling. TTT reformulates attention operation as an online learning problem, constructing a compact inner model from key-value pairs at test time. This reformulation opens a rich and flexible design space while achieving linear computational complexity. However, crafting a powerful visual TTT design remains challenging: fundamental choices for the inner module and inner training lack comprehensive understanding and practical guidelines. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we present a systematic empirical study of TTT designs for visual sequence modeling. From a series of experiments and analyses, we distill six practical insights that establish design principles for effective visual TTT and illuminate paths for future improvement. These findings culminate in the Vision Test-Time Training (ViT$^3$) model, a pure TTT architecture that achieves linear complexity and parallelizable computation. We evaluate ViT$^3$ across diverse visual tasks, including image classification, image generation, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Results show that ViT$^3$ consistently matches or outperforms advanced linear-complexity models (e.g., Mamba and linear attention variants) and effectively narrows the gap to highly optimized vision Transformers. We hope this study and the ViT$^3$ baseline can facilitate future work on visual TTT models. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ViTTT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN methods face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and complex relationships, which are vital for accurate retinal vessel segmentation.

Method: The DB-KAUNet employs a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) combining CNN and Transformer pathways, with novel KANConv and KAT blocks. Key components like the Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module and attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) modules optimize feature processing.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1) confirm that DB-KAUNet delivers leading-edge segmentation performance and robustness.

Conclusion: DB-KAUNet effectively addresses the limitations of traditional CNNs, achieving accurate and efficient retinal vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of retinal vessels is crucial for the clinical diagnosis of numerous ophthalmic and systemic diseases. However, traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) methods exhibit inherent limitations, struggling to capture long-range dependencies and complex nonlinear relationships. To address the above limitations, an Adaptive Dual Branch Kolmogorov-Arnold UNet (DB-KAUNet) is proposed for retinal vessel segmentation. In DB-KAUNet, we design a Heterogeneous Dual-Branch Encoder (HDBE) that features parallel CNN and Transformer pathways. The HDBE strategically interleaves standard CNN and Transformer blocks with novel KANConv and KAT blocks, enabling the model to form a comprehensive feature representation. To optimize feature processing, we integrate several critical components into the HDBE. First, a Cross-Branch Channel Interaction (CCI) module is embedded to facilitate efficient interaction of channel features between the parallel pathways. Second, an attention-based Spatial Feature Enhancement (SFE) module is employed to enhance spatial features and fuse the outputs from both branches. Building upon the SFE module, an advanced Spatial Feature Enhancement with Geometrically Adaptive Fusion (SFE-GAF) module is subsequently developed. In the SFE-GAF module, adaptive sampling is utilized to focus on true vessel morphology precisely. The adaptive process strengthens salient vascular features while significantly reducing background noise and computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1 datasets validate that DB-KAUNet achieves leading segmentation performance and demonstrates exceptional robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve the challenge of detecting tiny and dense objects alongside large objects in remote sensing imagery, addressing scalability and balanced detection performance issues.

Method: ScaleBridge-Det integrates Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) for feature fusion and Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) for density-based query adjustments to optimize detection for diverse scales.

Result: Experimental results show that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark datasets like AI-TOD-V2, DTOD, and demonstrates strong cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.

Conclusion: ScaleBridge-Det effectively balances detection performance across scales and densities, advancing the field of remote sensing object detection.

Abstract: Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.

Method: GRASP introduces guided residual adapters and cluster-based sample partitioning using external priors to minimize gradient conflicts, enhancing rare condition generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated superior performance on FID, diversity metrics, and downstream classification tasks for rare classes, notably for datasets like MIMIC-CXR-LT and ImageNet-LT.

Conclusion: GRASP proves effective in improving synthetic data diversity and quality in long-tail conditions, making it scalable and integration-ready for diffusion pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable high-fidelity generation across diverse prompts. However, these models falter in long-tail settings, such as medical imaging, where rare pathologies comprise a small fraction of data. This results in mode collapse: tail-class outputs lack quality and diversity, undermining the goal of synthetic data augmentation for underrepresented conditions. We pinpoint gradient conflicts between frequent head and rare tail classes as the primary culprit, a factor unaddressed by existing sampling or conditioning methods that mainly steer inference without altering the learned distribution. To resolve this, we propose GRASP: Guided Residual Adapters with Sample-wise Partitioning. GRASP uses external priors to statically partition samples into clusters that minimize intra-group gradient clashes. It then fine-tunes pre-trained models by injecting cluster-specific residual adapters into transformer feedforward layers, bypassing learned gating for stability and efficiency. On the long-tail MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, GRASP yields superior FID and diversity metrics, especially for rare classes, outperforming baselines like vanilla fine-tuning and Mixture of Experts variants. Downstream classification on NIH-CXR-LT improves considerably for tail labels. Generalization to ImageNet-LT confirms broad applicability. Our method is lightweight, scalable, and readily integrates with diffusion pipelines.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of creating realistic hand-object interaction (HOI) videos by introducing a scalable, structure and contact-aware representation for better interaction fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing methods in modeling physical constraints like contact and occlusion in HOI video generation, balancing scalability and interaction fidelity.

Method: The method involves a novel interaction-oriented representation focusing on hand-object contact, occlusion, and structure context without relying on 3D annotations. A joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy is utilized.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos across two datasets and exhibits strong generalization to open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed representation and methodology enhance the generation of realistic HOI videos with improved scalability and fidelity, addressing previous limitations in interaction modeling and generalization.

Abstract: Generating realistic hand-object interactions (HOI) videos is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of modeling physical constraints (e.g., contact and occlusion between hands and manipulated objects). Current methods utilize HOI representation as an auxiliary generative objective to guide video synthesis. However, there is a dilemma between 2D and 3D representations that cannot simultaneously guarantee scalability and interaction fidelity. To address this limitation, we propose a structure and contact-aware representation that captures hand-object contact, hand-object occlusion, and holistic structure context without 3D annotations. This interaction-oriented and scalable supervision signal enables the model to learn fine-grained interaction physics and generalize to open-world scenarios. To fully exploit the proposed representation, we introduce a joint-generation paradigm with a share-and-specialization strategy that generates interaction-oriented representations and videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets in generating physics-realistic and temporally coherent HOI videos. Furthermore, our approach exhibits strong generalization to challenging open-world scenarios, highlighting the benefit of our scalable design. Our project page is https://hgzn258.github.io/SCAR/.

Conclusion: This method highlights the potential of AI-driven approaches to enhance mesothelioma diagnosis and treatment plans, even in limited material settings.

Abstract: Accurate subtype classification and outcome prediction in mesothelioma are essential for guiding therapy and patient care. Most computational pathology models are trained on large tissue images from resection specimens, limiting their use in real-world settings where small biopsies are common. We show that a self-supervised encoder trained on resection tissue can be applied to biopsy material, capturing meaningful morphological patterns. Using these patterns, the model can predict patient survival and classify tumor subtypes. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools to support diagnosis and treatment planning in mesothelioma.

TL;DR: DreamingComics improves story visualization by enhancing artistic consistency and positioning subjects based on layout-aware approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visualization methods fail to maintain artistic and identity consistency while positioning subjects accurately.

Method: The framework utilizes a pretrained diffusion-transformer model, RegionalRoPE for region-based encoding, a masked condition loss for subject feature control, and an LLM-based layout generator for natural language script layout inference.

Result: DreamingComics achieved a 29.2% improvement in character consistency, 36.2% in style similarity, and maintained high spatial accuracy over prior methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables enhanced visual storytelling with controllable and consistent outputs, validated through extensive evaluations.

Abstract: Current story visualization methods tend to position subjects solely by text and face challenges in maintaining artistic consistency. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamingComics, a layout-aware story visualization framework. We build upon a pretrained video diffusion-transformer (DiT) model, leveraging its spatiotemporal priors to enhance identity and style consistency. For layout-based position control, we propose RegionalRoPE, a region-aware positional encoding scheme that re-indexes embeddings based on the target layout. Additionally, we introduce a masked condition loss to further constrain each subject's visual features to their designated region. To infer layouts from natural language scripts, we integrate an LLM-based layout generator trained to produce comic-style layouts, enabling flexible and controllable layout conditioning. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our approach, showing a 29.2% increase in character consistency and a 36.2% increase in style similarity compared to previous methods, while displaying high spatial accuracy.

*Xiuli Bi,Die Xiao,Junchao Fan,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to improve weakly supervised semantic segmentation by addressing over-activation in non-target regions using semantic and spatial-level corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses deficiencies in existing CLIP-based weakly supervised segmentation methods, particularly in handling over-activations in non-target foreground and background areas.

Method: The authors propose two mechanisms: Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) for semantic feature alignment to reduce inter-class overlap, and Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) to use spatial priors for background interference rectification.

Result: The proposed SSR method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with mIoU scores of 79.5% on PASCAL VOC and 50.6% on MS COCO datasets, surpassing single-stage and complex multi-stage approaches.

Conclusion: The SSR method demonstrates that incorporating semantic and spatial rectifications into CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation effectively resolves over-activation issues, leading to improved segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely applied to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes FreqEdit, a stable, training-free framework for natural language-guided image editing across multiple iterations without degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing models face significant quality degradation during multi-turn edits due to progressive loss of high-frequency information.

Method: The proposed FreqEdit framework includes three key components: high-frequency feature injection, an adaptive injection strategy for precise spatial control, and a path compensation mechanism to prevent over-constraint.

Result: FreqEdit outperformed seven state-of-the-art models in preserving image identity and following instructions during multi-turn edits.

Conclusion: FreqEdit effectively addresses multi-turn image editing challenges, achieving stability and high-quality edits with no additional training required.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing through natural language has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive visual manipulation. While recent models achieve impressive results on single edits, they suffer from severe quality degradation under multi-turn editing. Through systematic analysis, we identify progressive loss of high-frequency information as the primary cause of this quality degradation. We present FreqEdit, a training-free framework that enables stable editing across 10+ consecutive iterations. Our approach comprises three synergistic components: (1) high-frequency feature injection from reference velocity fields to preserve fine-grained details, (2) an adaptive injection strategy that spatially modulates injection strength for precise region-specific control, and (3) a path compensation mechanism that periodically recalibrates the editing trajectory to prevent over-constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqEdit achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and instruction following compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines.

### [381] [HiconAgent: History Context-aware Policy Optimization for GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01763)
*Xurui Zhou,Gongwei Chen,Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Kaiwen Zhou,Shuai Wang,Shuo Yang,Zhuotao Tian,Rui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiconAgent, a GUI agent designed to optimize history usage, outperforming larger models with reduced computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents often struggle with excessive computational overhead from naive historical context usage, leading to inefficiencies in decision making.

Method: HiconAgent is trained using History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO), featuring Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) for adaptive history use and Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) for efficient policy updates.

Result: HiconAgent-3B achieved higher performance than GUI-R1-7B in grounding accuracy and step success rate, while reducing FLOPs by 60% and speeding up computation by 2.47x on certain benchmarks.

Conclusion: HiconAgent effectively balances performance and efficiency, marking progress in adaptive historical context usage for GUI navigation tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents require effective use of historical context to perform sequential navigation tasks. While incorporating past actions and observations can improve decision making, naive use of full history leads to excessive computational overhead and distraction from irrelevant information. To address this, we introduce HiconAgent, a GUI agent trained with History Context-aware Policy Optimization (HCPO) for efficient and effective utilization of historical information. HCPO optimizes history usage in both sampling and policy updates through two complementary components: (1) Dynamic Context Sampling (DCS) presents the agent with variable length histories during sampling, enabling adaptive use of the most relevant context; (2) Anchor-guided History Compression (AHC) refines the policy update phase with a dual branch strategy where the compressed branch removes history observations while keeping history actions as information flow anchors. The compressed and uncompressed branches are coupled through a history-enhanced alignment loss to enforce consistent history usage while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on mainstream GUI navigation benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Despite being smaller, HiconAgent-3B outperforms GUI-R1-7B by +8.46 percent grounding accuracy and +11.32 percent step success rate on GUI-Odyssey, while achieving comparable results on AndroidControl and AITW with up to 2.47x computational speedup and 60 percent FLOPs reduction.

### [382] [VideoScoop: A Non-Traditional Domain-Independent Framework For Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01769)
*Hafsa Billah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a general-purpose Video Situation Analysis (VSA) framework using a combination of relational and graph models to detect meaningful activities across domains, overcoming limitations of current manual and custom algorithm-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the inefficiencies, errors, and lack of generalizability in current video situation analysis methods. Existing techniques either require manual intervention, which is error-prone, or rely on custom algorithms limited to specific domains or video types.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid VSA framework that uses state-of-the-art video content extraction and presents the data in two models: the relational model (R++) for continuous query processing and graph models for detecting complex situations. Domain independence is achieved through parameterized templates of primitive situations.

Result: Extensive experiments were conducted across Assisted Living (AL), Civic Monitoring (CM), and Surveillance (SL) domains. Results showed the approach to be accurate, efficient, and robust when analyzing videos of varying lengths from these domains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates a general-purpose, accurate, efficient, and robust approach for automated video situation analysis while eliminating domain-specific limitations, highlighting its potential across multiple application scenarios.

Abstract: Automatically understanding video contents is important for several applications in Civic Monitoring (CM), general Surveillance (SL), Assisted Living (AL), etc. Decades of Image and Video Analysis (IVA) research have advanced tasks such as content extraction (e.g., object recognition and tracking). Identifying meaningful activities or situations (e.g., two objects coming closer) remains difficult and cannot be achieved by content extraction alone. Currently, Video Situation Analysis (VSA) is done manually with a human in the loop, which is error-prone and labor-intensive, or through custom algorithms designed for specific video types or situations. These algorithms are not general-purpose and require a new algorithm/software for each new situation or video from a new domain.
  This report proposes a general-purpose VSA framework that overcomes the above limitations. Video contents are extracted once using state-of-the-art Video Content Extraction technologies. They are represented using two alternative models -- the extended relational model (R++) and graph models. When represented using R++, the extracted contents can be used as data streams, enabling Continuous Query Processing via the proposed Continuous Query Language for Video Analysis. The graph models complement this by enabling the detection of situations that are difficult or impossible to detect using the relational model alone. Existing graph algorithms and newly developed algorithms support a wide variety of situation detection. To support domain independence, primitive situation variants across domains are identified and expressed as parameterized templates. Extensive experiments were conducted across several interesting situations from three domains -- AL, CM, and SL-- to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach using a dataset of videos of varying lengths from these domains.

*Ahsan Raza Siyal,Markus Haltmeier,Ruth Steiger,Malik Galijasevic,Elke Ruth Gizewski,Astrid Ellen Grams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method enhancing medical image registration using adaptive edge detection kernels to address traditional challenges, demonstrating improved performance across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional medical image registration methods struggle with contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality variations, necessitating more robust alignment techniques.

Method: The authors integrate learnable edge kernels with both rigid and non-rigid registration techniques, beginning with a predefined edge detection kernel perturbed with noise and trained to optimize task-specific edge extraction.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques in rigid and non-rigid registration across both experimental setups and publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: This adaptive edge kernel-based approach improves multi-modal image alignment and enhances anatomical structure analysis, with promising potential in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Medical image registration is crucial for various clinical and research applications including disease diagnosis or treatment planning which require alignment of images from different modalities, time points, or subjects. Traditional registration techniques often struggle with challenges such as contrast differences, spatial distortions, and modality-specific variations. To address these limitations, we propose a method that integrates learnable edge kernels with learning-based rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. Unlike conventional layers that learn all features without specific bias, our approach begins with a predefined edge detection kernel, which is then perturbed with random noise. These kernels are learned during training to extract optimal edge features tailored to the task. This adaptive edge detection enhances the registration process by capturing diverse structural features critical in medical imaging. To provide clearer insight into the contribution of each component in our design, we introduce four variant models for rigid registration and four variant models for non-rigid registration. We evaluated our approach using a dataset provided by the Medical University across three setups: rigid registration without skull removal, with skull removal, and non-rigid registration. Additionally, we assessed performance on two publicly available datasets. Across all experiments, our method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its potential to improve multi-modal image alignment and anatomical structure analysis.

*Syed Hesham Syed Ariff,Yun Liu,Guolei Sun,Jing Yang,Henghui Ding,Xue Geng,Xudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores extending the Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS), focusing on its ability to provide dense segmentation and object-aware features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in extending SAM2 for dense VSS, such as requiring spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and tracking objects with complex boundaries.

Method: Two approaches are studied: (1) using SAM2 to extract unique masks while refining segmentation through another network; and (2) using the extracted masks to generate feature vectors for classification, merging classifications and masks for final output.

Result: The experiments reveal that SAM2 enhances performance in VSS due to accurate object boundary predictions.

Conclusion: SAM2 is effective for dense VSS, and leveraging its strengths can significantly improve segmentation performance in videos.

Abstract: The Segmentation Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has proven to be a powerful foundation model for promptable visual object segmentation in both images and videos, capable of storing object-aware memories and transferring them temporally through memory blocks. While SAM2 excels in video object segmentation by providing dense segmentation masks based on prompts, extending it to dense Video Semantic Segmentation (VSS) poses challenges due to the need for spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and the ability to track multiple objects with complex boundaries and varying scales. This paper explores the extension of SAM2 for VSS, focusing on two primary approaches and highlighting firsthand observations and common challenges faced during this process. The first approach involves using SAM2 to extract unique objects as masks from a given image, with a segmentation network employed in parallel to generate and refine initial predictions. The second approach utilizes the predicted masks to extract unique feature vectors, which are then fed into a simple network for classification. The resulting classifications and masks are subsequently combined to produce the final segmentation. Our experiments suggest that leveraging SAM2 enhances overall performance in VSS, primarily due to its precise predictions of object boundaries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates task-specific learned compression for satellite-based Earth observation data, comparing it with traditional JPEG 2000 in reducing data size while retaining critical details. Learned compression performs better in some cases, but not consistently across all datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in data transmission and storage due to the rapid growth of Earth observation data, while maintaining essential information for segmentation tasks.

Method: The study compares traditional JPEG 2000 compression with a learned Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood compression technique on three segmentation tasks: fire, cloud, and building detection.

Result: Learned compression outperforms JPEG 2000 on large multi-channel optical images in terms of reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy, but JPEG 2000 remains competitive for single-channel thermal infrared datasets.

Conclusion: Learned compression has potential but is not universally superior; performance depends on data type and task, with standalone optimization yielding comparable results to joint end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data from satellite-based Earth observation (EO) systems poses significant challenges in data transmission and storage. We evaluate the potential of task-specific learned compression algorithms in this context to reduce data volumes while retaining crucial information. In detail, we compare traditional compression (JPEG 2000) versus a learned compression approach (Discretized Mixed Gaussian Likelihood) on three EO segmentation tasks: Fire, cloud, and building detection. Learned compression notably outperforms JPEG 2000 for large-scale, multi-channel optical imagery in both reconstruction quality (PSNR) and segmentation accuracy. However, traditional codecs remain competitive on smaller, single-channel thermal infrared datasets due to limited data and architectural constraints. Additionally, joint end-to-end optimization of compression and segmentation models does not improve performance over standalone optimization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new evaluation metric using a learned representation of real-world human actions to address the lack of temporal understanding and motion accuracy in current video generative models, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of robust metrics for assessing the visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions in generated videos, as current models struggle with temporal understanding and intricate motion dynamics.

Method: The proposed method leverages a novel evaluation metric based on a fused representation of appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features and appearance-based features, comparing generated videos against real-world human action distributions.

Result: The metric improves video evaluation by over 68% compared to state-of-the-art methods on a new benchmark, correlates better with human perception, and performs well on external benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work highlights deficiencies in existing video generative models, proposes an advanced metric for better temporal and motion fidelity assessment, and sets a new standard in video generation research.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in video generative models, robust metrics for evaluating visual and temporal correctness of complex human actions remain elusive. Critically, existing pure-vision encoders and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are strongly appearance-biased, lack temporal understanding, and thus struggle to discern intricate motion dynamics and anatomical implausibilities in generated videos. We tackle this gap by introducing a novel evaluation metric derived from a learned latent space of real-world human actions. Our method first captures the nuances, constraints, and temporal smoothness of real-world motion by fusing appearance-agnostic human skeletal geometry features with appearance-based features. We posit that this combined feature space provides a robust representation of action plausibility. Given a generated video, our metric quantifies its action quality by measuring the distance between its underlying representations and this learned real-world action distribution. For rigorous validation, we develop a new multi-faceted benchmark specifically designed to probe temporally challenging aspects of human action fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we show that our metric achieves substantial improvement of more than 68% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on our benchmark, performs competitively on established external benchmarks, and has a stronger correlation with human perception. Our in-depth analysis reveals critical limitations in current video generative models and establishes a new standard for advanced research in video generation.

*Juanxi Tian,Siyuan Li,Conghui He,Lijun Wu,Cheng Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents "Envision," a benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal models in generating dynamic, causal event progressions over time using chained text-to-multi-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of current multimodal models that focus on static, single-image generations, which hinder their ability to model dynamic processes and causal-temporal reasoning.

Method: The authors propose a novel benchmark, Envision, consisting of 1,000 prompts spanning six domains, to evaluate models on causal, temporal, and aesthetic consistency in sequential multi-image generation. They introduce Envision-Score, a metric assessing these aspects holistically.

Result: Evaluation of 15 models revealed that while specialized T2I models excel in aesthetics, they lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified models perform better in causal narrative coherence but still struggle with spatiotemporal constraints, especially when compared to closed-source models.

Conclusion: Current models' focus on single images limits their ability to internalize world knowledge and model dynamic processes, calling for advancements in spatiotemporal reasoning and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Current multimodal models aim to transcend the limitations of single-modality representations by unifying understanding and generation, often using text-to-image (T2I) tasks to calibrate semantic consistency. However, their reliance on static, single-image generation in training and evaluation leads to overfitting to static pattern matching and semantic fusion, while fundamentally hindering their ability to model dynamic processes that unfold over time. To address these constraints, we propose Envision-a causal event progression benchmark for chained text-to-multi-image generation. Grounded in world knowledge and structured by spatiotemporal causality, it reorganizes existing evaluation dimensions and includes 1,000 four-stage prompts spanning six scientific and humanities domains. To transition evaluation from single images to sequential frames and assess whether models truly internalize world knowledge while adhering to causal-temporal constraints, we introduce Envision-Score, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional consistency, physicality, and aesthetics. Comprehensive evaluation of 15 models (10 specialized T2I models, 5 unified models) uncovers: specialized T2I models demonstrate proficiency in aesthetic rendering yet lack intrinsic world knowledge. Unified multimodal models bridge this gap, consistently outperforming specialized counterparts in causal narrative coherence. However, even these unified architectures remain subordinate to closed-source models and struggle to overcome the core challenge of spatiotemporal consistency. This demonstrates that a focus on causally-isolated single images impedes multi-frame reasoning and generation, promoting static pattern matching over dynamic world modeling-ultimately limiting world knowledge internalization, generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MILO, a method to improve spatial reasoning in MLLMs by incorporating visual generator feedback and relative positional encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack effective spatial reasoning due to reliance on textual learning without visual grounding.

Method: MILO integrates a visual generator with geometry-aware feedback and proposes RePE for encoding relative camera-pose transformations. GeoGen, a large-scale dataset, was created to support training.

Result: Experiments show MILO enhances spatial reasoning across baselines and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MILO provides a comprehensive improvement in understanding 3D spatial structures in MLLMs.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to understand and interpret the 3D structure of the world, is a critical yet underdeveloped capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods predominantly rely on verbal descriptive tuning, which suffers from visual illiteracy, i.e., they learn spatial concepts through textual symbols alone, devoid of connection to their visual manifestations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MILO, an Implicit spatIaL wOrld modeling paradigm that simulates human-like spatial imagination. MILO integrates a visual generator to provide geometry-aware feedback, thereby implicitly grounding the MLLM's symbolic reasoning in perceptual experience. Complementing this paradigm, we propose RePE (Relative Positional Encoding), a novel encoding scheme that captures relative camera-pose transformations, offering superior performance over absolute coordinate systems. To support the training, we construct GeoGen, a large-scale Geometry-aware Generative dataset with approximately 2,241 videos and 67,827 observation-action-outcome triplets. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning capabilities across multiple baselines and benchmarks, offering a more holistic understanding of 3D space.

Abstract: Causal thinking enables humans to understand not just what is seen, but why it happens. To replicate this capability in modern AI systems, we introduce the task of visual causal discovery. It requires models to infer cause-and-effect relations among visual entities across diverse scenarios instead of merely perceiving their presence. To this end, we first construct the Visual Causal Graph dataset (VCG-32K), a large-scale collection of over 32,000 images annotated with entity-level causal graphs, and further develop CauSight, a novel vision-language model to perform visual causal discovery through causally aware reasoning. Our training recipe integrates three components: (1) training data curation from VCG-32K, (2) Tree-of-Causal-Thought (ToCT) for synthesizing reasoning trajectories, and (3) reinforcement learning with a designed causal reward to refine the reasoning policy. Experiments show that CauSight outperforms GPT-4.1 on visual causal discovery, achieving over a threefold performance boost (21% absolute gain).

TL;DR: The paper proposes OpenREAD, a framework using a vision-language model for end-to-end reinforcement fine-tuning, enhancing reasoning and planning in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations in current fine-tuning strategies for autonomous driving include restricted generalization of reasoning during supervised fine-tuning and reward-quantification challenges in open-ended scene understanding during reinforcement fine-tuning.

Method: The authors construct a large dataset with Chain-of-Thought annotations and utilize the Qwen3 large language model for reinforcement fine-tuning to evaluate reasoning quality. This enables end-to-end improvement from reasoning to trajectory planning.

Result: The OpenREAD framework demonstrates significant performance advancements in reasoning and planning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: OpenREAD effectively addresses critical limitations of current fine-tuning methods, showcasing the potential of vision-language models in autonomous driving through end-to-end reinforcement fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, two-stage fine-tuning strategies, e.g., acquiring essential driving knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further enhancing decision-making and planning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), have shown strong potential in advancing the knowledge-driven autonomous driving (AD) paradigm. However, the learning nature of SFT still limits the generalization of reasoning, thereby constraining the full potential of driving performance. Meanwhile, current RFT approaches are primarily applied to downstream tasks, since scene understanding is an open-ended problem where corresponding rewards are difficult to quantify. To address these limitations, we propose OpenREAD, an OPEN-ended REasoning reinforced vision-language model (VLM)-based autonomous driving (AD) framework that enables end-to-end RFT across the full spectrum from high-level reasoning to low-level trajectory planning. Specifically, we begin by constructing large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations on open-source driving-related knowledge datasets, and employ the powerful Qwen3 large language model (LLM) as the critic in RFT to quantify reasoning quality for open-ended questions during reward modeling. Extensive experiments confirm that joint end-to-end RFT yields substantial improvements in both upstream and downstream tasks, enabling OpenREAD to achieve state-of-the-art performance on reasoning and planning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Physical Implausibility Detection (PID) dataset and a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (PhyDetEx) to detect and explain physically implausible videos generated by Text-to-Video (T2V) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need to evaluate and improve the physical plausibility of videos generated by T2V models, as existing Vision-Language Models struggle to detect physically impossible content.

Method: The researchers constructed a PID dataset comprising real-world and generated implausible videos and proposed a lightweight fine-tuning approach for Vision-Language Models to detect and interpret physical implausibility in T2V-generated content.

Result: They demonstrated that while T2V models have improved video quality, challenges persist in their adherence to physical laws, especially for open-source models. The fine-tuned model (PhyDetEx) serves as an efficient detector and explainer for physically implausible events.

Conclusion: There is still significant room for improvement in ensuring physically plausible video generation by T2V models. The introduction of the PID dataset and fine-tuned PhyDetEx model provides a foundation for further advancements in this area.

Abstract: Driven by the growing capacity and training scale, Text-to-Video (T2V) generation models have recently achieved substantial progress in video quality, length, and instruction-following capability. However, whether these models can understand physics and generate physically plausible videos remains a question. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose evaluators in various applications, they struggle to identify the physically impossible content from generated videos. To investigate this issue, we construct a \textbf{PID} (\textbf{P}hysical \textbf{I}mplausibility \textbf{D}etection) dataset, which consists of a \textit{test split} of 500 manually annotated videos and a \textit{train split} of 2,588 paired videos, where each implausible video is generated by carefully rewriting the caption of its corresponding real-world video to induce T2V models producing physically implausible content. With the constructed dataset, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning approach, enabling VLMs to not only detect physically implausible events but also generate textual explanations on the violated physical principles. Taking the fine-tuned VLM as a physical plausibility detector and explainer, namely \textbf{PhyDetEx}, we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art T2V models to assess their adherence to physical laws. Our findings show that although recent T2V models have made notable progress toward generating physically plausible content, understanding and adhering to physical laws remains a challenging issue, especially for open-source models. Our dataset, training code, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://github.com/Zeqing-Wang/PhyDetEx}{https://github.com/Zeqing-Wang/PhyDetEx}.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) for sports video analysis, addressing limitations in current models' handling of temporal hierarchy and task adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sports video analysis models struggle with temporal hierarchy, generalization, high development costs, and poor interpretability.

Method: The paper introduces a Multi-Agent System (MAS) composed of specialized cognitive agents capable of iterative invocation and composition for diverse analysis tasks.

Result: The adaptability of this MAS framework is demonstrated through badminton tasks, bridging granular event detection and global summarization capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework shifts towards scalable, interpretable, and robust sports video intelligence, enabling task flexibility through adaptive pipelines.

Abstract: Intelligent sports video analysis demands a comprehensive understanding of temporal context, from micro-level actions to macro-level game strategies. Existing end-to-end models often struggle with this temporal hierarchy, offering solutions that lack generalization, incur high development costs for new tasks, and suffer from poor interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable Multi-Agent System (MAS) as a foundational framework for sports video understanding. In our system, each agent functions as a distinct "cognitive tool" specializing in a specific aspect of analysis. The system's architecture is not confined to a single temporal dimension or task. By leveraging iterative invocation and flexible composition of these agents, our framework can construct adaptive pipelines for both short-term analytic reasoning (e.g., Rally QA) and long-term generative summarization (e.g., match summaries). We demonstrate the adaptability of this framework using two representative tasks in badminton analysis, showcasing its ability to bridge fine-grained event detection and global semantic organization. This work presents a paradigm shift towards a flexible, scalable, and interpretable system for robust, cross-task sports video intelligence.The project homepage is available at https://aiden1020.github.io/COACH-project-page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransientTrack is a deep learning method for cell tracking in time-lapse microscopy videos that accurately detects cell division and death using lightweight embeddings and transformer networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for improved methods to track cells in time-lapse videos, especially those that can incorporate fluctuating fluorescent signals and detect significant cellular events like division and death, which current techniques lack.

Method: TransientTrack employs deep learning with transformer networks and multi-stage matching techniques on multi-channel microscopy videos. It directly matches detection embeddings, avoids feature quantification, and interpolates missing tracks using Kalman Filters.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong cell tracking performance under diverse conditions and successfully captures cellular events like division and death.

Conclusion: TransientTrack offers capabilities to analyze single-cell dynamics for studies like chemotherapeutic responses, paving the way for advanced cancer research. The code is public.

Abstract: Tracking cells in time-lapse videos is an essential technique for monitoring cell population dynamics at a single-cell level. Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations in existing SLAM systems such as dependency on depth sensors, offline calibration, and poor adaptability to dynamic scenes, enabling broader applicability for ego-centric and spatial intelligence applications.

Method: KM-ViPE integrates DINO visual features with geometric constraints using adaptive robust kernels. It enables online localization and semantic mapping by fusing geometric data with deep visual features aligned to language embeddings.

Result: KM-ViPE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art systems while uniquely offering dynamic scene handling, uncalibrated monocular operation, and online processing.

Conclusion: KM-ViPE advances spatial intelligence for embodied AI, providing robust SLAM capabilities suitable for autonomous robotics and AR/VR by leveraging internet-scale video data, real-time adaptability, and open-vocabulary design.

Abstract: We present KM-ViPE (Knowledge Mapping Video Pose Engine), a real-time open-vocabulary SLAM framework for uncalibrated monocular cameras in dynamic environments. Unlike systems requiring depth sensors and offline calibration, KM-ViPE operates directly on raw RGB streams, making it ideal for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data for training. KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness. KM-ViPE benefits from internet-scale training and uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes, which makes it a good fit for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications and advances practical spatial intelligence capabilities for embodied AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to generalize across domains or require extensive fine-tuning and curated datasets to obtain domain-invariant identity representation in cross-domain face retargeting.

Method: Introduces a dual-encoder framework paired with efficient data augmentation and uses a diffusion model conditioned on disentangled signals for identity and stylistic attribute control.

Result: Demonstrates superior identity preservation and expression retargeting fidelity across various visual domains without relying on specialized curated datasets.

Conclusion: 'StyleYourSmile' simplifies and improves cross-domain face retargeting by eliminating the need for curated data and test-time optimizations, enabling robust performance in diverse domains.

Abstract: Cross-domain face retargeting requires disentangled control over identity, expressions, and domain-specific stylistic attributes. Existing methods, typically trained on real-world faces, either fail to generalize across domains, need test-time optimizations, or require fine-tuning with carefully curated multi-style datasets to achieve domain-invariant identity representations. In this work, we introduce \textit{StyleYourSmile}, a novel one-shot cross-domain face retargeting method that eliminates the need for curated multi-style paired data. We propose an efficient data augmentation strategy alongside a dual-encoder framework, for extracting domain-invariant identity cues and capturing domain-specific stylistic variations. Leveraging these disentangled control signals, we condition a diffusion model to retarget facial expressions across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{StyleYourSmile} achieves superior identity preservation and retargeting fidelity across a wide range of visual domains.

### [397] [SARL: Spatially-Aware Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Visuo-Tactile Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01908)
*Gurmeher Khurana,Lan Wei,Dandan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SARL, a spatially-aware self-supervised learning framework tailored for fused visual-tactile data in robotic manipulation, outperforming existing methods and emphasizing the importance of spatial structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation tasks rely on spatially-aware representations aligning visual and tactile data. However, most self-supervised learning methods compress feature maps into global vectors, losing spatial structure crucial for manipulation.

Method: SARL builds on the BYOL architecture, introducing three spatially-aware objectives: Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM). These objectives maintain spatial relations across feature maps.

Result: SARL outperformed nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks, achieving significant improvement in geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression with a 30% relative reduction in error compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: Structured spatial equivariance in fused visual-tactile features is critical for enhancing robotic perception capabilities, making SARL a promising method for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Contact-rich robotic manipulation requires representations that encode local geometry. Vision provides global context but lacks direct measurements of properties such as texture and hardness, whereas touch supplies these cues. Modern visuo-tactile sensors capture both modalities in a single fused image, yielding intrinsically aligned inputs that are well suited to manipulation tasks requiring visual and tactile information. Most self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks, however, compress feature maps into a global vector, discarding spatial structure and misaligning with the needs of manipulation. To address this, we propose SARL, a spatially-aware SSL framework that augments the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) architecture with three map-level objectives, including Saliency Alignment (SAL), Patch-Prototype Distribution Alignment (PPDA), and Region Affinity Matching (RAM), to keep attentional focus, part composition, and geometric relations consistent across views. These losses act on intermediate feature maps, complementing the global objective. SARL consistently outperforms nine SSL baselines across six downstream tasks with fused visual-tactile data. On the geometry-sensitive edge-pose regression task, SARL achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3955, a 30% relative improvement over the next-best SSL method (0.5682 MAE) and approaching the supervised upper bound. These findings indicate that, for fused visual-tactile data, the most effective signal is structured spatial equivariance, in which features vary predictably with object geometry, which enables more capable robotic perception.

TL;DR: Med-VCD proposes a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method to reduce hallucinations in medical LVLMs, improving factual and hallucination accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure accurate medical vision-language model outputs by addressing critical hallucination vulnerabilities without slowing down inference.

Method: A new token-sparsification strategy selects visually-informed tokens during decoding, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Across eight datasets, Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by 13% and hallucination accuracy by 6%, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: Med-VCD improves the reliability and efficiency of medical LVLMs for healthcare applications, successfully mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are now central to healthcare applications such as medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. Yet, these models remain vulnerable to hallucination outputs that appear plausible but are in fact incorrect. In the natural image domain, several decoding strategies have been proposed to mitigate hallucinations by reinforcing visual evidence, but most rely on secondary decoding or rollback procedures that substantially slow inference. Moreover, existing solutions are often domain-specific and may introduce misalignment between modalities or between generated and ground-truth content. We introduce Med-VCD, a sparse visual-contrastive decoding method that mitigates hallucinations in medical LVLMs without the time overhead of secondary decoding. Med-VCD incorporates a novel token-sparsification strategy that selects visually informed tokens on the fly, trimming redundancy while retaining critical visual context and thus balancing efficiency with reliability. Evaluations on eight medical datasets, spanning ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology tasks in visual question answering, report generation, and dedicated hallucination benchmarks, show that Med-VCD raises factual accuracy by an average of 13\% and improves hallucination accuracy by 6\% relative to baseline medical LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdvTraj, an online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection multi-object tracking (MOT) systems that confuse tracking algorithms without tampering with object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous attacks on MOT systems have been non-robust, limited to specific models or offline datasets. There is a need for a robust and effective method to demonstrate vulnerabilities in MOT algorithms, specifically in their object ID association phase.

Method: The authors developed AdvTraj, an adversarial trajectory-based attack that manipulates IDs in MOT systems without attacking object detection, and tested it using simulations in CARLA. They also identified universal adversarial trajectories executable by humans in everyday scenarios.

Result: AdvTraj achieved a 100% success rate in white-box attacks against SORT, with up to 93% success on other SOTA MOT systems due to shared design principles.

Conclusion: The study highlights previously unexplored weaknesses in object ID association in contemporary MOT systems, urging improvements in system robustness.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel plug-and-play pruning method called Script, which efficiently reduces visual token redundancy in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) without requiring retraining, achieving high efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address memory and latency issues in MLLMs, which arise due to the rapid growth of visual tokens in high-resolution image and video processing.

Method: The paper introduces Script, consisting of a graph-structured pruning module for removing visually redundant tokens and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module for preserving query-relevant information.

Result: Script delivers significant efficiency improvements, such as up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B model, while maintaining 96.88% of the original performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Script is an effective and versatile pruning method that enhances multimodal task performance while significantly reducing computational overhead in MLLMs.

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual tokens in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) leads to excessive memory consumption and inference latency, especially when handling high-resolution images and videos. Token pruning is a technique used to mitigate this issue by removing redundancy, but existing methods often ignore relevance to the user query or suffer from the limitations of attention mechanisms, reducing their adaptability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Script, a plug-and-play pruning method that requires no retraining and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Script comprises two modules: a graph-structured pruning module that removes visually redundant tokens, and a query-conditioned semantic pruning module that preserves query-relevant visual information. Together, they enhance performance on multimodal tasks. Experiments on fourteen benchmarks across image and video understanding tasks show that Script consistently achieves higher model efficiency and predictive accuracy compared to existing pruning methods. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, it achieves up to 6.8x prefill speedup and 10x FLOP reduction, while retaining 96.88% of the original performance.

TL;DR: SpriteHand is a framework for real-time video synthesis of hand-object interactions using autoregressive generation, improving over conventional simulation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations of existing simulation-based models in capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid, articulated, and complex objects.

Method: They propose an autoregressive video generation framework leveraging causal inference architecture and a hybrid post-training enhancement approach.

Result: SpriteHand achieves real-time generation at 18 FPS, high resolution, and low latency, showing superior experimental results in visual, physical, and interaction quality.

Conclusion: SpriteHand offers a robust solution for synthesizing versatile hand-object interaction videos with improved quality and real-time performance.

Abstract: Modeling and synthesizing complex hand-object interactions remains a significant challenge, even for state-of-the-art physics engines. Conventional simulation-based approaches rely on explicitly defined rigid object models and pre-scripted hand gestures, making them inadequate for capturing dynamic interactions with non-rigid or articulated entities such as deformable fabrics, elastic materials, hinge-based structures, furry surfaces, or even living creatures. In this paper, we present SpriteHand, an autoregressive video generation framework for real-time synthesis of versatile hand-object interaction videos across a wide range of object types and motion patterns. SpriteHand takes as input a static object image and a video stream in which the hands are imagined to interact with the virtual object embedded in a real-world scene, and generates corresponding hand-object interaction effects in real time. Our model employs a causal inference architecture for autoregressive generation and leverages a hybrid post-training approach to enhance visual realism and temporal coherence. Our 1.3B model supports real-time streaming generation at around 18 FPS and 640x368 resolution, with an approximate 150 ms latency on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, and more than a minute of continuous output. Experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, physical plausibility, and interaction fidelity compared to both generative and engine-based baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new task called 'Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning' (SegCaptioning), which generates diverse caption-mask pairs based on a simple input prompt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of high-cost prompts and restricted outputs in controllable image semantic understanding tasks like captioning or segmentation.

Method: Introduces a Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model using a scene graph adaptor, bimodal transformer, and contrastive learning loss to predict semantically aligned caption-mask pairs.

Result: The proposed method, SGDiff, outperforms existing approaches on two datasets, delivering effective SegCaptioning capabilities with minimal prompts.

Conclusion: SGDiff successfully addresses the challenges of aligning captions and masks from minimal inputs, offering flexible and diverse semantic interpretations for users.

Abstract: Controllable image semantic understanding tasks, such as captioning or segmentation, necessitate users to input a prompt (e.g., text or bounding boxes) to predict a unique outcome, presenting challenges such as high-cost prompt input or limited information output. This paper introduces a new task ``Image Collaborative Segmentation and Captioning'' (SegCaptioning), which aims to translate a straightforward prompt, like a bounding box around an object, into diverse semantic interpretations represented by (caption, masks) pairs, allowing flexible result selection by users. This task poses significant challenges, including accurately capturing a user's intention from a minimal prompt while simultaneously predicting multiple semantically aligned caption words and masks. Technically, we propose a novel Scene Graph Guided Diffusion Model that leverages structured scene graph features for correlated mask-caption prediction. Initially, we introduce a Prompt-Centric Scene Graph Adaptor to map a user's prompt to a scene graph, effectively capturing his intention. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion process incorporating a Scene Graph Guided Bimodal Transformer to predict correlated caption-mask pairs by uncovering intricate correlations between them. To ensure accurate alignment, we design a Multi-Entities Contrastive Learning loss to explicitly align visual and textual entities by considering inter-modal similarity, resulting in well-aligned caption-mask pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that SGDiff achieves superior performance in SegCaptioning, yielding promising results for both captioning and segmentation tasks with minimal prompt input.

*Wei Tang,Yanpeng Sun,Shan Zhang,Xiaofan Li,Piotr Koniusz,Wei Li,Na Zhao,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Artemis, a structured proposal-based reasoning framework for perception-policy learning, addressing limitations of linguistic reasoning in visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of using natural language reasoning chains in reinforcement learning for visual tasks, which often reduce performance due to the unstructured linguistic reasoning being unsuitable for spatial and object-centric tasks.

Method: The proposed method, Artemis, utilizes structured proposal-based reasoning where intermediate reasoning steps are captured as (label, bounding-box) pairs representing visual states. This eliminates ambiguities associated with language-based reasoning while enabling explicit state tracking and quality supervision.

Result: Artemis achieves strong performance in grounding and detection tasks, generalizes effectively to counting and geometric-perception tasks, and shows consistent improvements across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Aligning reasoning processes with spatial representations improves perception-policy learning, providing a principled pathway toward scalable and general perception frameworks. Artemis demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach while achieving competitive results on MLLM benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement-learning frameworks for visual perception policy have begun to incorporate intermediate reasoning chains expressed in natural language. Empirical observations indicate that such purely linguistic intermediate reasoning often reduces performance on perception tasks. We argue that the core issue lies not in reasoning per se but in the form of reasoning: while these chains perform semantic reasoning in an unstructured linguistic space, visual perception requires reasoning in a spatial and object-centric space. In response, we introduce Artemis, a perception-policy learning framework that performs structured proposal-based reasoning, where each intermediate step is represented as a (label, bounding-box) pair capturing a verifiable visual state. This design enables explicit tracking of intermediate states, direct supervision for proposal quality, and avoids ambiguity introduced by language-based reasoning. Artemis is built on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, achieves strong performance on grounding and detection task and exhibits substantial generalization to counting and geometric-perception tasks. The consistent improvements across these diverse settings confirm that aligning reasoning with spatial representations enhances perception-policy learning. Owing to its strengthened visual reasoning, Artemis also achieves competitive performance on general MLLM benchmarks, illustrating that spatially grounded reasoning provides a principled route toward scalable and general perception policies.

Abstract: Physical AI aims to develop models that can perceive and predict real-world dynamics; yet, the extent to which current multi-modal large language models and video generative models support these abilities is insufficiently understood. We introduce Physical AI Bench (PAI-Bench), a unified and comprehensive benchmark that evaluates perception and prediction capabilities across video generation, conditional video generation, and video understanding, comprising 2,808 real-world cases with task-aligned metrics designed to capture physical plausibility and domain-specific reasoning. Our study provides a systematic assessment of recent models and shows that video generative models, despite strong visual fidelity, often struggle to maintain physically coherent dynamics, while multi-modal large language models exhibit limited performance in forecasting and causal interpretation. These observations suggest that current systems are still at an early stage in handling the perceptual and predictive demands of Physical AI. In summary, PAI-Bench establishes a realistic foundation for evaluating Physical AI and highlights key gaps that future systems must address.

*Lidong Lu,Guo Chen,Zhu Wei,Yicheng Liu,Tong Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG) to segment interaction regions using action sounds rather than text or visuals. A novel dataset is provided, along with a high-performing model called AVAGFormer.


<details>

Method: They construct a novel AV-AG dataset combining action sounds, object images, and detailed annotations, along with a model called AVAGFormer featuring semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixers and dual-head decoders.

Result: AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in the AV-AG task, outpacing related baselines. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed AVAGFormer and AV-AG dataset effectively integrate visual and audio modalities for affordance grounding, proving the potential of audio in this domain. All resources are open-sourced, allowing further research.

Abstract: We introduce Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG), a new task that segments object interaction regions from action sounds. Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks. Comprehensive analyses highlight the distinctions between AV-AG and AVS, the benefits of end-to-end modeling, and the contribution of each component. Code and dataset have been released on https://jscslld.github.io/AVAGFormer/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale, diverse datasets limits advancements in 360-degree omnidirectional spatial understanding.

Method: AirSim360 creates a platform that enables omnidirectional data collection using drones, integrating features like pixel-level labeling, pedestrian behavior modeling, and automated navigation trajectory generation.

Abstract: The field of 360-degree omnidirectional understanding has been receiving increasing attention for advancing spatial intelligence. However, the lack of large-scale and diverse data remains a major limitation. In this work, we propose AirSim360, a simulation platform for omnidirectional data from aerial viewpoints, enabling wide-ranging scene sampling with drones. Specifically, AirSim360 focuses on three key aspects: a render-aligned data and labeling paradigm for pixel-level geometric, semantic, and entity-level understanding; an interactive pedestrian-aware system for modeling human behavior; and an automated trajectory generation paradigm to support navigation tasks. Furthermore, we collect more than 60K panoramic samples and conduct extensive experiments across various tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our simulator. Unlike existing simulators, our work is the first to systematically model the 4D real world under an omnidirectional setting. The entire platform, including the toolkit, plugins, and collected datasets, will be made publicly available at https://insta360-research-team.github.io/AirSim360-website.

### [408] [Improved Mean Flows: On the Challenges of Fastforward Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02012)
*Zhengyang Geng,Yiyang Lu,Zongze Wu,Eli Shechtman,J. Zico Kolter,Kaiming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces improved MeanFlow (iMF), an enhanced framework for one-step generative modeling, resolving training and guidance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the training stability and flexibility of the MeanFlow generative model by addressing its dependency issues and inflexible guidance mechanism.

Method: The objective is reformulated as a regression problem on instantaneous velocity using a network that predicts average velocity, and guidance is integrated as explicit conditioning variables with in-context conditioning.

Result: The proposed iMF achieves an FID of 1.72 on ImageNet 256×256 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE), outperforming prior methods in its category.

Conclusion: iMF successfully enhances one-step generative modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results among similar methods and demonstrating its potential as a stand-alone paradigm for generative modeling.

Abstract: MeanFlow (MF) has recently been established as a framework for one-step generative modeling. However, its ``fastforward'' nature introduces key challenges in both the training objective and the guidance mechanism. First, the original MF's training target depends not only on the underlying ground-truth fields but also on the network itself. To address this issue, we recast the objective as a loss on the instantaneous velocity $v$, re-parameterized by a network that predicts the average velocity $u$. Our reformulation yields a more standard regression problem and improves the training stability. Second, the original MF fixes the classifier-free guidance scale during training, which sacrifices flexibility. We tackle this issue by formulating guidance as explicit conditioning variables, thereby retaining flexibility at test time. The diverse conditions are processed through in-context conditioning, which reduces model size and benefits performance. Overall, our $\textbf{improved MeanFlow}$ ($\textbf{iMF}$) method, trained entirely from scratch, achieves $\textbf{1.72}$ FID with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256$\times$256. iMF substantially outperforms prior methods of this kind and closes the gap with multi-step methods while using no distillation. We hope our work will further advance fastforward generative modeling as a stand-alone paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUNA is a unified multimodal model for understanding and generation tasks using a continuous visual representation from a VAE and representation encoder cascade, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome representation mismatches in multimodal tasks and improve performance by using a unified visual representation space for understanding and generation.

Method: TUNA uses a cascaded VAE encoder and representation encoder to create a unified continuous visual representation, enabling end-to-end image and video processing. Joint training of understanding and generation tasks is also employed.

Result: TUNA consistently outperforms prior models in multimodal understanding, generation, and editing tasks by utilizing stronger pretrained representation encoders and joint training. It achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: TUNA's unified representation design provides scalable and effective multimodal task performance by avoiding representation mismatches and leveraging task synergy.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to jointly perform multimodal understanding and generation within a single framework. We present TUNA, a native UMM that builds a unified continuous visual representation by cascading a VAE encoder with a representation encoder. This unified representation space allows end-to-end processing of images and videos for both understanding and generation tasks. Compared to prior UMMs with decoupled representations, TUNA's unified visual space avoids representation format mismatches introduced by separate encoders, outperforming decoupled alternatives in both understanding and generation. Moreover, we observe that stronger pretrained representation encoders consistently yield better performance across all multimodal tasks, highlighting the importance of the representation encoder. Finally, in this unified setting, jointly training on both understanding and generation data allows the two tasks to benefit from each other rather than interfere. Our extensive experiments on multimodal understanding and generation benchmarks show that TUNA achieves state-of-the-art results in image and video understanding, image and video generation, and image editing, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of its unified representation design.

### [410] [Generative Video Motion Editing with 3D Point Tracks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02015)
*Yao-Chih Lee,Zhoutong Zhang,Jiahui Huang,Jui-Hsien Wang,Joon-Young Lee,Jia-Bin Huang,Eli Shechtman,Zhengqi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for precise joint editing of camera and object motions in videos using 3D point tracks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise editing of camera and object motions in videos is challenging, especially under complex movements. Existing methods lack sufficient control over fine-grained motions and full-scene context for consistent video editing.

Method: The authors propose a track-conditioned video-to-video (V2V) framework where a video generation model is conditioned on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions.

Result: The model enables accurate joint camera and object motion editing, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformations while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence through depth cue resolutions provided by 3D tracks.

Conclusion: The model introduces new capabilities for video editing by utilizing explicit 3D depth cues, unlocking creative possibilities and addressing prior limitations in motion editing methods.

Abstract: Camera and object motions are central to a video's narrative. However, precisely editing these captured motions remains a significant challenge, especially under complex object movements. Current motion-controlled image-to-video (I2V) approaches often lack full-scene context for consistent video editing, while video-to-video (V2V) methods provide viewpoint changes or basic object translation, but offer limited control over fine-grained object motion. We present a track-conditioned V2V framework that enables joint editing of camera and object motion. We achieve this by conditioning a video generation model on a source video and paired 3D point tracks representing source and target motions. These 3D tracks establish sparse correspondences that transfer rich context from the source video to new motions while preserving spatiotemporal coherence. Crucially, compared to 2D tracks, 3D tracks provide explicit depth cues, allowing the model to resolve depth order and handle occlusions for precise motion editing. Trained in two stages on synthetic and real data, our model supports diverse motion edits, including joint camera/object manipulation, motion transfer, and non-rigid deformation, unlocking new creative potential in video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates video generators' understanding of gravity and identifies significant inaccuracies in their representation of physical laws. A novel unit-free protocol reveals biases in generated physical behaviors, but specialized fine-tuning shows promise in improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the capability of video generators as world models in encoding and understanding fundamental physical laws, particularly gravity.

Method: Video generators' representation of gravity was tested using a unit-free, two-object protocol. Targeted specialization was applied using lightweight, low-rank adapters fine-tuned with minimal data.

Result: Initial gravity representations in video generators were inaccurate, violating physical principles like Galileo's equivalence. Fine-tuning improved the effective gravity representation from 1.81 m/s² to 6.43 m/s².

Conclusion: Video generators struggle with representing physical laws like gravity due to inherent biases. However, these issues can be partially addressed through lightweight, specialized adaptations with minimal fine-tuning data.

Abstract: Video generators are increasingly evaluated as potential world models, which requires them to encode and understand physical laws. We investigate their representation of a fundamental law: gravity. Out-of-the-box video generators consistently generate objects falling at an effectively slower acceleration. However, these physical tests are often confounded by ambiguous metric scale. We first investigate if observed physical errors are artifacts of these ambiguities (e.g., incorrect frame rate assumptions). We find that even temporal rescaling cannot correct the high-variance gravity artifacts. To rigorously isolate the underlying physical representation from these confounds, we introduce a unit-free, two-object protocol that tests the timing ratio $t_1^2/t_2^2 = h_1/h_2$, a relationship independent of $g$, focal length, and scale. This relative test reveals violations of Galileo's equivalence principle. We then demonstrate that this physical gap can be partially mitigated with targeted specialization. A lightweight low-rank adaptor fine-tuned on only 100 single-ball clips raises $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ from $1.81\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ to $6.43\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$ (reaching $65\%$ of terrestrial gravity). This specialist adaptor also generalizes zero-shot to two-ball drops and inclined planes, offering initial evidence that specific physical laws can be corrected with minimal data.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents optimized strategies for parallel $k$-core decomposition in shared-memory systems using Rust, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for faster and scalable algorithms to handle increasingly large and complex networks, beyond the limitations of sequential solutions, motivated this study.

Method: The authors adapted a distributed $k$-core algorithm for shared-memory systems and implemented three versions in Rust: SequentialK as a baseline, ParallelK with multi-threading, and FastK to minimize synchronization costs.

Result: FastK achieved up to 11x speedup on 16 threads and was orders of magnitude faster than a Python implementation in real-world graph datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of parallelized $k$-core decomposition using Rust, showcasing substantial runtime improvements and validating its utility for analyzing large-scale networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the parallelization of $k$-core decomposition, a method used in graph analysis to identify cohesive substructures and assess node centrality. Although efficient sequential algorithms exist for this task, the scale of modern networks requires faster, multicore-ready approaches. To this end, we adapt a distributed $k$-core algorithm originally proposed by Montresor et al. to shared-memory systems and implement it in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths in concurrency and memory safety. We developed three progressively optimized versions: SequentialK as a baseline, ParallelK introducing multi-threaded message passing, and FastK further reducing synchronization overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including road networks, web graphs, and social networks, show that FastK consistently outperforms both SequentialK and ParallelK, as well as a reference Python implementation available in the NetworkX library. Results indicate up to an 11x speedup on 16 threads and execution times up to two orders of magnitude faster than the Python implementation.

TL;DR: Heimdall++, an advanced single-pulse search tool for radio astronomy, offers significant performance enhancements through optimized GPU resource utilization, achieving faster processing speeds while preserving result accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern radio astronomy requires real-time single-pulse detection due to increasing data volume and higher resolution of radio telescopes. Conventional tools like Heimdall face limitations in efficiency and resource utilization.

Method: Heimdall++ utilizes fine-grained GPU parallelization, improved memory management, and a multi-threaded framework to separate CPU and GPU processing stages, addressing inefficiencies in resource usage.

Result: Experimental evaluations with NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPUs show up to 2.66x speedup in single-file processing and 2.05x speedup in multi-file batch processing compared to the original Heimdall.

Conclusion: Heimdall++ optimizes real-time single-pulse detection in radio astronomy by significantly enhancing computational efficiency and achieving superior processing speeds without compromising result accuracy.

Abstract: With the increasing time and frequency resolution of modern radio telescopes and the exponential growth in observational data volumes, real-time single-pulse detection has become a critical requirement for time-domain radio astronomy. Heimdall, as a representative GPU-accelerated single-pulse search tool, offers substantial performance advantages over CPU-based approaches. However, its sequential execution model and resource contention in intermediate processing stages limit GPU utilization, leading to suboptimal throughput and increased computational latency. To address these limitations, we present Heimdall++, an optimized successor to Heimdall that incorporates fine-grained GPU parallelization, enhanced memory management, and a multi-threaded framework to decouple CPU-bound and GPU-bound processing stages. This design mitigates the GPU stall problem and improves end-to-end efficiency. We evaluated Heimdall++ on a system equipped with NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPUs using both a single large-scale observational file and multiple files. Experimental results demonstrate that Heimdall++ achieves up to 2.66x speedup in single-file processing and 2.05x speedup in multi-file batch processing, while maintaining full consistency with the original Heimdall's search results.

TL;DR: The paper proposes IslandRun, a system for privacy-aware, multi-objective AI inference orchestration across diverse computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI inference lacks a unified system to balance performance, privacy, cost, and trust simultaneously, leading to inefficiencies in heterogeneous settings.

Method: IslandRun employs multi-objective optimization, localized data processing, and anonymization techniques on autonomous resources treated as “islands." It uses agent-based routing, tiered trust, and placeholder sanitization.

Result: IslandRun establishes a decentralized framework that routes computation intelligently across devices, private servers, and cloud, optimizing for diverse objectives.

Conclusion: IslandRun redefines orchestration for AI inference in heterogeneous environments, achieving a balance across performance, privacy, and trust.

Abstract: Modern AI inference faces an irreducible tension: no single computational resource simultaneously maximizes performance, preserves privacy, minimizes cost, and maintains trust. Existing orchestration frameworks optimize single dimensions (Kubernetes prioritizes latency, federated learning preserves privacy, edge computing reduces network distance), creating solutions that struggle under real-world heterogeneity. We present IslandRun, a multi-objective orchestration system that treats computational resources as autonomous "islands" spanning personal devices, private edge servers, and public cloud. Our key insights: (1) request-level heterogeneity demands policy-constrained multi-objective optimization, (2) data locality enables routing compute to data rather than data to compute, and (3) typed placeholder sanitization preserves context semantics across trust boundaries. IslandRun introduces agent-based routing, tiered island groups with differential trust, and reversible anonymization. This establishes a new paradigm for privacy-aware, decentralized inference orchestration across heterogeneous personal computing ecosystems.

Motivation: To address the challenges of high mobility, limited energy resources, and dynamic topology in FANETs.

Method: The algorithm focuses on mobility-aware clustering, energy-centric cluster head selection, and ground station-assisted cluster maintenance for efficient FANET operations.

Result: Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm improves cluster stability, reduces communication overhead, and enhances security resilience compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering algorithm is an effective solution to the challenges faced by FANETs, offering improved performance in key communication metrics.

Abstract: Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), formed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), represent an emerging and promising communication paradigm. These networks face unique challenges due to UAVs high mobility, limited energy resources, and dynamic topology. In this work, we propose a novel multi-hop clustering algorithm aimed at creating stable, energy-efficient clusters in FANET environments. The proposed solution enhances cluster longevity and communication efficiency through mobility-aware clustering, energy-centric cluster head (CH) selection, and a ground station(GS)-assisted cluster maintenance management mechanism. First, steady multi-hop clusters are constructed, having CHs with not only high stability and high energy but also with steady and high-energy neighboring areas, and then a proper GS-assisted cluster maintenance mechanism is applied. Experimental results, based on extended simulations, demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing schemes significantly, in terms of cluster stability, communication overhead, and security resilience.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlexiWalker is a novel GPU framework designed for efficient dynamic random walks on graphs, significantly outperforming existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for dynamic random walks fail to adapt efficiently to workload diversity and evolving graph properties, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: FlexiWalker combines high-performance kernel designs, a lightweight runtime cost model, and compile-time optimization of user-supplied walk logic to improve dynamic random walk efficiency.

Result: FlexiWalker achieves 73.44x (CPU) and 5.91x (GPU) speed-ups over the best published baselines and supports complex workloads unsupported by prior systems.

Conclusion: FlexiWalker efficiently addresses the challenges of dynamic random walks with its novel design and achieves significant performance gains, making it a valuable open-source tool.

Abstract: Dynamic random walks are fundamental to various graph analysis applications, offering advantages by adapting to evolving graph properties. Their runtime-dependent transition probabilities break down the pre-computation strategy that underpins most existing CPU and GPU static random walk optimizations. This leaves practitioners suffering from suboptimal frameworks and having to write hand-tuned kernels that do not adapt to workload diversity. To handle this issue, we present FlexiWalker, the first GPU framework that delivers efficient, workload-generic support for dynamic random walks. Our design-space study shows that rejection sampling and reservoir sampling are more suitable than other sampling techniques under massive parallelism. Thus, we devise (i) new high-performance kernels for them that eliminate global reductions, redundant memory accesses, and random-number generation. Given the necessity of choosing the best-fitting sampling strategy at runtime, we adopt (ii) a lightweight first-order cost model that selects the faster kernel per node at runtime. To enhance usability, we introduce (iii) a compile-time component that automatically specializes user-supplied walk logic into optimized building blocks. On various dynamic random walk workloads with real-world graphs, FlexiWalker outperforms the best published CPU/GPU baselines by geometric means of 73.44x and 5.91x, respectively, while successfully executing workloads that prior systems cannot support. We open-source FlexiWalker in https://github.com/AIS-SNU/FlexiWalker.

*Bohan Zhao,Zane Cao,Yongchao He*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes SIMPLE, a solution to optimize sampling bottlenecks in large language models using a sequence-parallel and CPU-disaggregated approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling, the process of turning logits into tokens in LLMs, becomes a bottleneck as models scale with tensor and pipeline parallelism, limiting performance improvements.

Method: SIMPLE introduces sequence-parallel sampling, CPU-based linear-time filtering algorithms, and speculative hot-vocab sampling to remove bottlenecks and improve performance.

Result: SIMPLE achieves up to 96% throughput improvement and lowers P95 latency by 20-65%, while requiring no changes to user-side code.

Conclusion: SIMPLE effectively optimizes LLM sampling, maintains compatibility with data-plane optimizations, and enables scalable benefits for future GPU advancements.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale out with tensor parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) and production stacks have aggressively optimized the data plane (attention/GEMM and KV cache), sampling, the decision plane that turns logits into tokens, becomes a new bottleneck. This creates a structural holdout: sampling neither expands with TP nor balances across PP stages, so its share of iteration time grows as GPUs get faster and it caps pipeline frequency at the last stage. We present SIMPLE, a stage-agnostic, sequence-parallel, overlappable decision plane that disaggregates sampling into a CPU-side service and shrinks its runtime footprint back to a minor, hidden role. SIMPLE combines: (1) sequence-parallel sampling, which shards work along the batch dimension and removes vocabulary-axis collectives; (2) a CPU-based algorithm with column-wise penalties and truncation-first filtering to realize single-pass, linear-time kernels; and (3) speculative hot-vocab sampling (SHVS), which samples on a small hot set with rejection-correctness and uses a simple sizing model to choose the hot-vocab size that maximizes throughput. In evaluation, SIMPLE improves end-to-end throughput by up to 96% and reduces P95 latency by 20-65%. Crucially, SIMPLE requires no user-side code changes and composes with existing data-plane optimizations, unlocking scaling benefits that compound with future GPU generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the high computational and communication demands of federated fine-tuning for adapting LLMs on resource-constrained devices while maintaining data privacy.

Method: SmartFed introduces MoRE to decompose LoRA modules into rank-level experts for selective activation and EEQA for adaptive expert capacity allocation, optimizing resource usage.

Result: SmartFed achieves significant improvements in model performance and training efficiency compared to existing methods across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SmartFed provides an innovative approach to resource-efficient federated fine-tuning, effectively utilizing existing knowledge and optimizing resource usage for better scalability and performance.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning offers a promising solution for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks while safeguarding data privacy. However, its high computational and communication demands hinder its deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose SmartFed, a resource-efficient federated fine-tuning framework. SmartFed intelligently reuses knowledge embedded in existing LoRA modules, eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch when adapting LLMs to new tasks. To effectively exploit this knowledge and ensure scalability, we introduce the Mixture of Rank-Wise Experts (MoRE). MoRE decomposes LoRA modules into fine-grained rank-level experts. These experts are selectively activated and combined based on input semantics and resource budgets. Moreover, to optimize resource utilization, we present the Elastic Expert Quota Allocation (EEQA). EEQA adaptively allocates expert capacity across parameter matrices based on their contribution to model performance, focusing computing resources on the critical experts. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SmartFed significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance and training efficiency.

*Aladin Djuhera,Fernando Koch,Alecio Binotto*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dynamic orchestration framework for large-scale foundation model inference in heterogeneous and volatile edge environments, overcoming the limitations of static layer partitioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of static partitioning strategies for model layers in heterogeneous, dynamic edge environments where compute and network resources are volatile.

Method: The proposed framework uses runtime-resolved constructs for spatial placement and segmentation of foundation models, formalized as a constrained optimization problem that adapts to latency, utilization, and privacy gradients.

Result: The framework integrates model-aware capacity profiling with dynamic graph re-partitioning/reallocation and demonstrates its application in 6G multi-access edge computing.

Conclusion: Foundation model inference in dynamic environments greatly benefits from reactive, runtime-resolved orchestration, offering improved adaptability and performance over static partitioning methods.

Abstract: Inference over large-scale foundation models within heterogeneous edge environments necessitates a fundamentally reconfigurable orchestration substrate. Static partitioning of model layers presumes temporal stability across compute and network resources, which is misaligned with the volatility of real-world deployments. We introduce a framework in which both the spatial placement and internal segmentation of foundation models are elevated to runtime-resolved constructs. The orchestration problem is formalized as a constrained optimization over layer-wise assignments, subject to evolving latency, utilization, and privacy gradients. The framework implements reactive inference composition responsive to infrastructural fluctuations by integrating model-aware capacity profiling with dynamic graph re-partitioning and reallocation. We introduce architectural and algorithmic components, along with a representative use case in 6G multi-access edge computing.

*Wenbin Zhu,Zhaoyan Shen,Zili Shao,Hongjun Dai,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Tangram minimizes serverless LLM loading latency using GPU memory reuse, achieving faster loading times and reduced cold-start delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the cold-start latency issue in serverless LLMs caused by linear model loading times, hindering their practical AI service deployment.

Method: Tangram leverages GPU memory reuse for efficient model loading, featuring unified memory pools, KV cache allocation, and GPU-aware scheduling.

Result: Prototype testing shows Tangram improves model loading speeds by up to 6.2x and reduces cold-start delays (TTFT) by 23-55% compared to leading methods.

Conclusion: The system effectively tackles inefficiencies in GPU memory and cold-start challenges, boosting practical deployment potential for serverless LLM platforms.

Abstract: Serverless Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cost-effective solution for deploying AI services by enabling a 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model through GPU resource sharing. However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.

*Tom Goethals,Merlijn Sebrechts,Stijn De Schrijver,Filip De Turck,Bruno Volckaert*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Delta Sum Learning to enhance aggregation in Gossip Learning and implements it using Open Application Model for seamless deployment of multi-workload applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aggregation methods in Federated and Gossip Learning are suboptimal for accuracy and scale, and there's a need for better deployment options for edge learning workloads.

Method: Introduced Delta Sum Learning for improved aggregation and implemented it within a decentralized orchestration framework leveraging Open Application Model for dynamic and declarative deployment.

Result: Delta Sum Learning exhibits strong global convergence, performs comparably to alternatives for small topologies, and achieves significant accuracy improvement over scaling, particularly under limited connectivity.

Conclusion: Delta Sum Learning effectively enhances model accuracy and scalability in decentralized systems, addressing core challenges in Gossip Learning and deployment flexibility.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a popular approach for distributed learning due to its security and computational benefits. With the advent of powerful devices in the network edge, Gossip Learning further decentralizes Federated Learning by removing centralized integration and relying fully on peer to peer updates. However, the averaging methods generally used in both Federated and Gossip Learning are not ideal for model accuracy and global convergence. Additionally, there are few options to deploy Learning workloads in the edge as part of a larger application using a declarative approach such as Kubernetes manifests. This paper proposes Delta Sum Learning as a method to improve the basic aggregation operation in Gossip Learning, and implements it in a decentralized orchestration framework based on Open Application Model, which allows for dynamic node discovery and intent-driven deployment of multi-workload applications. Evaluation results show that Delta Sum performance is on par with alternative integration methods for 10 node topologies, but results in a 58% lower global accuracy drop when scaling to 50 nodes. Overall, it shows strong global convergence and a logarithmic loss of accuracy with increasing topology size compared to a linear loss for alternatives under limited connectivity.

*Barenya Kumar Nandy,Rupesh Nasre*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimization framework for StarPlat's MPI backend to improve the scalability of distributed graph algorithms by leveraging communication aggregation and optimized reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address scaling complexities in large graph data processing caused by irregular access patterns and constraints of sequential/shared memory systems.

Method: An analysis-transformation framework in StarPlat identifies and optimizes iteration patterns for communication aggregation and introduces caching and a bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive RMA constructs.

Result: The optimization improved StarPlat's performance, surpassing d-Galois by 2.05 times and DRONE by 1.44 times in big data graph tests for Single Source Shortest Paths.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of distributed graph algorithms in StarPlat, demonstrating the value of communication aggregation and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Relational data, occurring in the real world, are often structured as graphs, which provide the logical abstraction required to make analytical derivations simpler. As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.

*Kingshuk Haldar*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving trace analysis for MPI applications by introducing time-resolved metrics instead of relying on aggregated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of impractical manual trace inspection caused by growing sizes and complex communication in MPI applications.

Method: The authors discretize execution traces, calculate time-resolved metrics, and handle anomalies in Paraver traces to identify transient bottlenecks.

Result: Time-resolved performance metrics revealed bottlenecks not visible with aggregated metrics, validated through synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications (LaMEM and ls1-MarDyn).

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable, lightweight method for identifying localized MPI performance bottlenecks, bypassing the need for extensive trace visualization.

Abstract: Detailed trace analysis of MPI applications is essential for performance engineering, but growing trace sizes and complex communication behaviour often render comprehensive visual inspection impractical. This work presents a trace-based calculation of time-resolved values of standard MPI performance metrics, load balance, serialisation, and transfer efficiency, by discretising execution traces into fixed or adaptive time segments. The implementation processes Paraver traces postmortem, reconstructing critical execution paths and handling common event anomalies, such as clock inconsistencies and unmatched MPI events, to robustly calculate metrics for each segment. The calculated per-window metric values expose transient performance bottlenecks that the timeaggregated metrics from existing tools may conceal. Evaluations on a synthetic benchmark and real-world applications (LaMEM and ls1-MarDyn) demonstrate how time-resolved metrics reveal localised performance bottlenecks obscured by global aggregates, offering a lightweight and scalable alternative even when trace visualisation is impractical.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and explainability of LLMs for structured tabular data in high-stakes applications like financial risk assessment.

Method: Systematically evaluated LLMs in financial tasks and analyzed their SHAP values, comparing them to LightGBM.

Result: Identified divergences between LLMs' self-explanations, SHAP values, and LightGBM's SHAP values.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations as standalone classifiers but hold potential when coupled with better explainability and few-shot prompting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for classification tasks, offering a flexible alternative to trusted classical machine learning models like LightGBM through zero-shot prompting. However, their reliability for structured tabular data remains unclear, particularly in high stakes applications like financial risk assessment. Our study systematically evaluates LLMs and generates their SHAP values on financial classification tasks. Our analysis shows a divergence between LLMs self-explanation of feature impact and their SHAP values, as well as notable differences between LLMs and LightGBM SHAP values. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone classifiers for structured financial modeling, but also instill optimism that improved explainability mechanisms coupled with few-shot prompting will make LLMs usable in risk-sensitive domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaVeX, a novel algorithm for creating verified explanations for neural network decisions, addressing scalability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the problem of explaining neural network decisions, which are often considered black-box systems, while addressing the scalability limitations of current verified explanation methods.

Method: FaVeX speeds up the computation of verified explanations by using batch and sequential processing of input features, reusing information from prior queries, and introducing a hierarchical approach with verifier-optimal robust explanations.

Result: FaVeX achieves superior scalability and produces formal, verified explanations for neural networks with high complexity, including those with hundreds of thousands of activations.

Conclusion: Verified explanations can be both scalable and meaningful for complex neural networks, with FaVeX pushing the boundaries on efficient and principled explanation generation.

Abstract: Verified explanations are a theoretically-principled way to explain the decisions taken by neural networks, which are otherwise black-box in nature. However, these techniques face significant scalability challenges, as they require multiple calls to neural network verifiers, each of them with an exponential worst-case complexity. We present FaVeX, a novel algorithm to compute verified explanations. FaVeX accelerates the computation by dynamically combining batch and sequential processing of input features, and by reusing information from previous queries, both when proving invariances with respect to certain input features, and when searching for feature assignments altering the prediction. Furthermore, we present a novel and hierarchical definition of verified explanations, termed verifier-optimal robust explanations, that explicitly factors the incompleteness of network verifiers within the explanation. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the superior scalability of both FaVeX, and of verifier-optimal robust explanations, which together can produce meaningful formal explanation on networks with hundreds of thousands of non-linear activations.

*Colin Doumont,Donney Fan,Natalie Maus,Jacob R. Gardner,Henry Moss,Geoff Pleiss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple Bayesian linear regression approach for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, outperforming complex models by leveraging geometric transformations and linear kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges posed by high-dimensional spaces in Bayesian optimization require simpler yet effective approaches to bypass the curse of dimensionality.

Method: A Bayesian linear regression approach is paired with geometric transformations and linear kernels for high-dimensional tasks, leveraging closed-form sampling and computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in optimization tasks with dimensions ranging from 60 to 6,000 and scales effectively with data exceeding 20,000 observations.

Conclusion: The findings challenge existing assumptions about Bayesian optimization, highlighting the simplicity and efficiency of linear models in high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: High-dimensional spaces have challenged Bayesian optimization (BO). Existing methods aim to overcome this so-called curse of dimensionality by carefully encoding structural assumptions, from locality to sparsity to smoothness, into the optimization procedure. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that these approaches are outperformed by arguably the simplest method imaginable: Bayesian linear regression. After applying a geometric transformation to avoid boundary-seeking behavior, Gaussian processes with linear kernels match state-of-the-art performance on tasks with 60- to 6,000-dimensional search spaces. Linear models offer numerous advantages over their non-parametric counterparts: they afford closed-form sampling and their computation scales linearly with data, a fact we exploit on molecular optimization tasks with > 20,000 observations. Coupled with empirical analyses, our results suggest the need to depart from past intuitions about BO methods in high-dimensional spaces.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how neural networks learn discrete computations on continuous data, using a geometric framework based on Riemannian metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind how neural networks handle discrete computations on continuous data, which is not well-explored.

Method: Investigating the Riemannian pullback metric across neural network layers to decompose computations into feature discretization and logical operations.

Result: The study reveals contrasting geometric structures in different network learning regimes (rich vs. lazy), impacting generalization.

Conclusion: The geometric framework explains how neural networks perform discrete reasoning on continuous input manifolds, based on representational geometry.

Abstract: Many tasks require mapping continuous input data (e.g. images) to discrete task outputs (e.g. class labels). Yet, how neural networks learn to perform such discrete computations on continuous data manifolds remains poorly understood. Here, we show that signatures of such computations emerge in the representational geometry of neural networks as they learn. By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orion-Bix is a tabular foundation model using biaxial attention and meta-learned in-context reasoning, excelling in few-shot tabular learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in building general-purpose models for tabular data, dealing with mixed data types, weak feature structures, and limited labeled data.

Method: It employs an encoder with various attention mechanisms (standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational), multi-CLS summarization, and a label-aware ICL head, trained on synthetic tables with causal priors.

Result: Orion-Bix outperforms gradient-boosting baselines and competes well with state-of-the-art models on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that biaxial attention combined with episodic meta-training fosters robust and efficient tabular learning, achieving generalization across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Tabular data drive most real-world machine learning applications, yet building general-purpose models for them remains difficult. Mixed numeric and categorical fields, weak feature structure, and limited labeled data make scaling and generalization challenging. To this end, we introduce Orion-Bix, a tabular foundation model that combines biaxial attention with meta-learned in-context reasoning for few-shot tabular learning. Its encoder alternates standard, grouped, hierarchical, and relational attention, fusing their outputs through multi-CLS summarization to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. A label-aware ICL head adapts on the fly and scales to large label spaces via hierarchical decision routing. Meta-trained on synthetically generated, structurally diverse tables with causal priors, Orion-Bix learns transferable inductive biases across heterogeneous data. Delivered as a scikit-learn compatible foundation model, it outperforms gradient-boosting baselines and remains competitive with state-of-the-art tabular foundation models on public benchmarks, showing that biaxial attention with episodic meta-training enables robust, few-shot-ready tabular learning. The model is publicly available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-BiX .

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework integrating an advanced U-Net variant with spatial clustering for improved seismic horizon interpretation in complex geological environments and sparse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in automated seismic horizon segmentation, particularly in complex geological structures and sparse annotations, using deep learning approaches.

Method: The hybrid framework combines advanced U-Net variants, including the novel CFA U-Net, with spatial clustering (DBSCAN). CFA U-Net utilizes Context Fusion Attention gates that integrate spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features to enhance prediction accuracy.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results, including a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms on the Mexilhao field dataset. It also achieved 97.6% surface coverage on sparse data from the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid methodology successfully improves seismic horizon interpretation, demonstrating robustness and generalizability in data-scarce and structurally complex environments.

Abstract: Interpreting seismic horizons is a critical task for characterizing subsurface structures in hydrocarbon exploration. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly U-Net-based architectures, have significantly improved automated horizon tracking. However, challenges remain in accurately segmenting complex geological features and interpolating horizons from sparse annotations. To address these issues, a hybrid framework is presented that integrates advanced U-Net variants with spatial clustering to enhance horizon continuity and geometric fidelity. The core contribution is the Context Fusion Attention (CFA) U-Net, a novel architecture that fuses spatial and Sobel-derived geometric features within attention gates to improve both precision and surface completeness. The performance of five architectures, the U-Net (Standard and compressed), U-Net++, Attention U-Net, and CFA U-Net, was systematically evaluated across various data sparsity regimes (10-, 20-, and 40-line spacing). This approach outperformed existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Mexilhao field (Santos Basin, Brazil) dataset with a validation IoU of 0.881 and MAE of 2.49ms, and excellent surface coverage of 97.6% on the F3 Block of the North Sea dataset under sparse conditions. The framework further refines merged horizon predictions (inline and cross-line) using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to produce geologically plausible surfaces. The results demonstrate the advantages of hybrid methodologies and attention-based architectures enhanced with geometric context, providing a robust and generalizable solution for seismic interpretation in structurally complex and data-scarce environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Soft QD,' a novel approach to Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization that avoids space discretization. It develops a new algorithm, SQUAD, which is scalable and competitive with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QD methods face challenges in large solution and high-dimensional behavior spaces due to impracticality of storing numerous solutions and inefficiencies of discretization. A new method is needed to overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposed 'Soft QD,' which avoids traditional discretization and formulated the SQUAD algorithm leveraging soft optimization principles for better scalability and performance.

Result: SQUAD demonstrates competitive performance with current state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks and showcases improved scalability in high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: Soft QD and the SQUAD algorithm represent a significant advancement in QD optimization by avoiding discretization issues and improving scalability, making them highly effective for large solution and high-dimensional problem spaces.

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms constitute a branch of optimization that is concerned with discovering a diverse and high-quality set of solutions to an optimization problem. Current QD methods commonly maintain diversity by dividing the behavior space into discrete regions, ensuring that solutions are distributed across different parts of the space. The QD problem is then solved by searching for the best solution in each region. This approach to QD optimization poses challenges in large solution spaces, where storing many solutions is impractical, and in high-dimensional behavior spaces, where discretization becomes ineffective due to the curse of dimensionality. We present an alternative framing of the QD problem, called \emph{Soft QD}, that sidesteps the need for discretizations. We validate this formulation by demonstrating its desirable properties, such as monotonicity, and by relating its limiting behavior to the widely used QD Score metric. Furthermore, we leverage it to derive a novel differentiable QD algorithm, \emph{Soft QD Using Approximated Diversity (SQUAD)}, and demonstrate empirically that it is competitive with current state of the art methods on standard benchmarks while offering better scalability to higher dimensional problems.

TL;DR: The paper enhances the framework for constructing fact-storing MLPs, improving their parameter efficiency, versatility for all input-output pairs, and usability within Transformers for factual recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent research has explored how LLMs store factual knowledge in MLP parameters, sparking interest in explicitly constructing such mechanisms to gain deeper insights into their functionality.

Method: The authors propose an improved MLP construction framework that addresses limitations in prior works by accommodating almost all feasible input-output pairs, optimizing parameter efficiency to match information-theoretic limits, and enhancing usability within Transformers.

Result: Key outcomes include a metric for facts-per-parameter scaling, a novel encoder-decoder mechanism achieving practical parameter efficiency, and identification of a tradeoff between storage capacity and Transformer integration.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of LLM fact storage and demonstrates practical applications, such as modular fact editing in one-layer Transformers, showcasing the feasibility of replacing entire MLPs at once.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) can be attributed in part to their ability to efficiently store factual knowledge as key-value mappings within their MLP parameters. Recent work has proposed explicit weight constructions to build such fact-storing MLPs, providing an improved understanding of LLM fact storage mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce an MLP construction framework that improves over previous constructions in three areas: it 1) works for all but a measure-zero set of feasible input-output pairs, 2) achieves asymptotically optimal parameter efficiency matching information-theoretic bounds for some embeddings, and 3) maintains usability within Transformers for factual recall. Through our improvements, we 1) discover a metric on value embeddings that characterizes facts-per-parameter scaling for both constructed and gradient-descent-trained MLPs, 2) identify a simple encoder-decoder mechanism that empirically matches gradient-descent MLP facts-per-parameter asymptotics across all the inputs and outputs we test, and 3) uncover a fundamental tradeoff between an MLP's fact-storage capacity and its usability within Transformers. Finally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of fact-storing MLPs: modular fact editing on one-layer Transformers by \textit{replacing entire MLPs at once}.

TL;DR: Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer, enhances performance in Graph Neural Networks by optimizing execution and memory usage, showing significant speedups and memory-efficiency across hardware platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks like PyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library fail to manage the hardware challenges of Graph Neural Networks due to generic kernels, leading to issues like poor cache locality and excessive memory usage.

Method: Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into backend-specialized implementations for different hardware environments. It uses optimized primitives and a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine to select efficient computational paths dynamically.

Result: Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs compared to existing frameworks. It also reduces peak memory usage by up to 15X, allowing large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: Specialized code synthesis, as demonstrated by Morphling, effectively resolves performance and memory challenges in GNN execution, providing scalability across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.

*Pirzada Suhail,Rehna Afroz,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The TIE framework introduces a unified method for robust anomaly detection and uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks, achieving high OOD detection performance without external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of overconfident and unreliable predictions in deep neural networks when faced with out-of-distribution inputs.

Method: The TIE framework iteratively refines an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class for OOD inputs and utilizing training, inversion, and exclusion processes within each epoch.

Result: TIE achieved near-perfect OOD detection, tested on MNIST and FashionMNIST, with significant performance metrics like AUROC, AUPR, and almost 0 FPR@95%TPR.

Conclusion: TIE provides a visually interpretable and effective approach for anomaly detection and uncertainty estimation, enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often struggle to recognize when an input lies outside their training experience, leading to unreliable and overconfident predictions. Building dependable machine learning systems therefore requires methods that can both estimate predictive \textit{uncertainty} and detect \textit{out-of-distribution (OOD)} samples in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TIE: a Training--Inversion--Exclusion} framework for visually interpretable and uncertainty-guided anomaly detection that jointly addresses these challenges through iterative refinement. TIE extends a standard $n$-class classifier to an $(n+1)$-class model by introducing a garbage class initialized with Gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. Within each epoch, TIE performs a closed-loop process of \textit{training, inversion, and exclusion}, where highly uncertain inverted samples reconstructed from the just-trained classifier are excluded into the garbage class. Over successive iterations, the inverted samples transition from noisy artifacts into visually coherent class prototypes, providing transparent insight into how the model organizes its learned manifolds. During inference, TIE rejects OOD inputs by either directly mapping them to the garbage class or producing low-confidence, uncertain misclassifications within the in-distribution classes that are easily separable, all without relying on external OOD datasets. A comprehensive threshold-based evaluation using multiple OOD metrics and performance measures such as \textit{AUROC}, \textit{AUPR}, and \textit{FPR@95\%TPR} demonstrates that TIE offers a unified and interpretable framework for robust anomaly detection and calibrated uncertainty estimation (UE) achieving near-perfect OOD detection with \textbf{\(\!\approx\!\) 0 FPR@95\%TPR} when trained on MNIST or FashionMNIST and tested against diverse unseen datasets.

*Yenho Chen,Maxwell A. Xu,James M. Rehg,Christopher J. Rozell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PULSE, a novel self-supervised learning approach to improve the representation of physiological time-series data by leveraging shared generative system parameters and discarding irrelevant noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised learning methods for physiological time-series fail due to their reliance on heuristic principles or unconstrained generative tasks, leading to poor preservation of meaningful physiological state information.

Method: The authors present PULSE, a pretraining framework that leverages a dynamical systems generative model and uses a cross-reconstruction-based objective to efficiently extract shared system parameters while discarding sample-specific noise.

Result: The framework is theoretically validated with sufficient conditions established for recovering system information. Empirical testing on synthetic and real-world datasets confirms PULSE improves semantic class distinction, label efficiency, and transfer learning.

Conclusion: PULSE offers a robust approach to self-supervised learning for physiological time-series, successfully addressing limitations of previous methods and achieving enhanced performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of self-supervised learning (SSL) for physiological time series depends on the ability of a pretraining objective to preserve information about the underlying physiological state while filtering out unrelated noise. However, existing strategies are limited due to reliance on heuristic principles or poorly constrained generative tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a pretraining framework that exploits the information structure of a dynamical systems generative model across multiple time-series. This framework reveals our key insight that class identity can be efficiently captured by extracting information about the generative variables related to the system parameters shared across similar time series samples, while noise unique to individual samples should be discarded. Building on this insight, we propose PULSE, a cross-reconstruction-based pretraining objective for physiological time series datasets that explicitly extracts system information while discarding non-transferrable sample-specific ones. We establish theory that provides sufficient conditions for the system information to be recovered, and empirically validate it using a synthetic dynamical systems experiment. Furthermore, we apply our method to diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that PULSE learns representations that can broadly distinguish semantic classes, increase label efficiency, and improve transfer learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a graph learning framework optimizing computational efficiency and performance on homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks compared to existing sheaf-based neural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural sheaf diffusion relies on resource-intensive computations, dense per-edge operations, and suffers from stability issues. The authors aim to address these challenges by providing a computationally efficient and robust alternative.

Method: PolyNSD uses a propagation operator that is a degree-K polynomial in a normalized sheaf Laplacian, evaluated with a stable three-term recurrence. It enables single-layer K-hop receptive fields and trainable convex spectral responses.

Result: PolyNSD achieves state-of-the-art results for both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks while reducing computational runtime, memory usage, and dependence on high-dimensional stalks.

Conclusion: PolyNSD offers a scalable and efficient solution, improving performance and stability for graph learning problems without the computational overhead and brittleness of previous approaches.

Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks equip graph structures with a cellular sheaf: a geometric structure which assigns local vector spaces (stalks) and a linear learnable restriction/transport maps to nodes and edges, yielding an edge-aware inductive bias that handles heterophily and limits oversmoothing. However, common Neural Sheaf Diffusion implementations rely on SVD-based sheaf normalization and dense per-edge restriction maps, which scale with stalk dimension, require frequent Laplacian rebuilds, and yield brittle gradients. To address these limitations, we introduce Polynomial Neural Sheaf Diffusion (PolyNSD), a new sheaf diffusion approach whose propagation operator is a degree-K polynomial in a normalised sheaf Laplacian, evaluated via a stable three-term recurrence on a spectrally rescaled operator. This provides an explicit K-hop receptive field in a single layer (independently of the stalk dimension), with a trainable spectral response obtained as a convex mixture of K+1 orthogonal polynomial basis responses. PolyNSD enforces stability via convex mixtures, spectral rescaling, and residual/gated paths, reaching new state-of-the-art results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks, inverting the Neural Sheaf Diffusion trend by obtaining these results with just diagonal restriction maps, decoupling performance from large stalk dimension, while reducing runtime and memory requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of scripted agents in dynamic scenarios and RL agents' scalability and black-box issues, aiming to improve intelligent agents for combat simulations.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical hybrid AI structure, utilizing scripted agents for routine decisions and RL agents for strategic decision-making.

Result: The integration of scripted and RL agents improves overall performance, showing robust and adaptable solutions in complex simulations.

Conclusion: The hierarchical hybrid AI approach successfully combines the strengths of scripted and RL agents, making it effective for intelligent agent development in challenging environments.

Abstract: In the domain of combat simulations in support of wargaming, the development of intelligent agents has predominantly been characterized by rule-based, scripted methodologies with deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches only recently being introduced. While scripted agents offer predictability and consistency in controlled environments, they fall short in dynamic, complex scenarios due to their inherent inflexibility. Conversely, RL agents excel in adaptability and learning, offering potential improvements in handling unforeseen situations, but suffer from significant challenges such as black-box decision-making processes and scalability issues in larger simulation environments. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach that synergizes the reliability and predictability of scripted agents with the dynamic, adaptive learning capabilities of RL. By structuring the AI system hierarchically, the proposed approach aims to utilize scripted agents for routine, tactical-level decisions and RL agents for higher-level, strategic decision-making, thus addressing the limitations of each method while leveraging their individual strengths. This integration is shown to significantly improve overall performance, providing a robust, adaptable, and effective solution for developing and training intelligent agents in complex simulation environments.

*Y. Sungtaek Ju*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sparse Variational GP-KANs, combining sparse variational inference with KAN topology, to achieve scalable and interpretable probabilistic modeling for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are limited by non-probabilistic outputs and scalability issues with larger datasets using currently available Gaussian Process extensions.

Method: Introduces Sparse Variational GP-KANs that combine sparse variational inference with the KAN structure, reducing computational complexity using $M$ inducing points and analytic moment matching.

Result: The method reduces computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(NM^2)$, achieves scalability, and integrates permutation-based importance analysis for better input relevance assessment.

Conclusion: Sparse Variational GP-KAN enables scalable probabilistic modeling, making KANs viable for large datasets while enhancing structural understanding of data relationships.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) by placing learnable univariate functions on network edges, enhancing interpretability. However, standard KANs lack probabilistic outputs, limiting their utility in applications requiring uncertainty quantification. While recent Gaussian Process (GP) extensions to KANs address this, they utilize exact inference methods that scale cubically with data size N, restricting their application to smaller datasets. We introduce the Sparse Variational GP-KAN (SVGP-KAN), an architecture that integrates sparse variational inference with the KAN topology. By employing $M$ inducing points and analytic moment matching, our method reduces computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(NM^2)$ or linear in sample size, enabling the application of probabilistic KANs to larger scientific datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that integrating a permutation-based importance analysis enables the network to function as a framework for structural identification, identifying relevant inputs and classifying functional relationships.

### [439] [Teleportation-Based Defenses for Privacy in Approximate Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00272)
*Mohammad M Maheri,Xavier Cadet,Peter Chin,Hamed Haddadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals privacy vulnerabilities in approximate machine unlearning methods caused by certain gradient and parameter-related issues. It proposes a novel defense (WARP) leveraging network symmetries to mitigate the leakage risks while preserving model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the emerging privacy risks of approximate machine unlearning, where adversaries can infer sensitive data through changes in model parameters after unlearning.

Method: The paper identifies vulnerabilities, proposes new attacks (membership inference and reconstruction), and introduces WARP, a defense strategy using neural network symmetries to obscure signals of forgotten data.

Result: WARP significantly improves privacy by reducing attack advantages (up to 92% in white-box and 64% in black-box scenarios) while maintaining pre-existing model accuracy on retained data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that WARP is effective at enhancing data privacy in approximate unlearning processes and highlights its potential for broader use in mitigating attack risks.

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific data points from a trained model, offering a practical alternative to full retraining. However, it introduces privacy risks: an adversary with access to pre- and post-unlearning models can exploit their differences for membership inference or data reconstruction. We show these vulnerabilities arise from two factors: large gradient norms of forget-set samples and the close proximity of unlearned parameters to the original model. To demonstrate their severity, we propose unlearning-specific membership inference and reconstruction attacks, showing that several state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NGP, SCRUB) remain vulnerable. To mitigate this leakage, we introduce WARP, a plug-and-play teleportation defense that leverages neural network symmetries to reduce forget-set gradient energy and increase parameter dispersion while preserving predictions. This reparameterization obfuscates the signal of forgotten data, making it harder for attackers to distinguish forgotten samples from non-members or recover them via reconstruction. Across six unlearning algorithms, our approach achieves consistent privacy gains, reducing adversarial advantage (AUC) by up to 64% in black-box and 92% in white-box settings, while maintaining accuracy on retained data. These results highlight teleportation as a general tool for reducing attack success in approximate unlearning.

*Vinam Arora,Divyansha Lachi,Ian J. Knight,Mehdi Azabou,Blake Richards,Cole L. Hurwitz,Josh Siegle,Eva L. Dyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces NuCLR, a self-supervised framework designed to differentiate neurons and enhance decoding tasks like cell type and brain region classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of inferring factors such as neuron type, connectivity, and brain region from neural activity by creating general-purpose representations of neural data.

Method: A self-supervised framework called NuCLR is proposed, which uses contrastive learning to create neuron-specific representations by aggregating views of the same neurons across time and stimuli. It employs a spatiotemporal transformer to integrate activity without fixed neuron ordering.

Result: NuCLR achieves state-of-the-art performance in decoding cell types and brain regions, shows strong generalization across animals, and is label-efficient. A systematic scaling analysis reveals that pretraining with data from more animals improves outcomes.

Conclusion: NuCLR successfully provides generalizable and scalable representations for neuron identity from diverse neural data, advancing interpretations of brain activity and enabling efficient use of labeled samples.

Abstract: Neurons process information in ways that depend on their cell type, connectivity, and the brain region in which they are embedded. However, inferring these factors from neural activity remains a significant challenge. To build general-purpose representations that allow for resolving information about a neuron's identity, we introduce NuCLR, a self-supervised framework that aims to learn representations of neural activity that allow for differentiating one neuron from the rest. NuCLR brings together views of the same neuron observed at different times and across different stimuli and uses a contrastive objective to pull these representations together. To capture population context without assuming any fixed neuron ordering, we build a spatiotemporal transformer that integrates activity in a permutation-equivariant manner. Across multiple electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, a linear decoding evaluation on top of NuCLR representations achieves a new state-of-the-art for both cell type and brain region decoding tasks, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to unseen animals. We present the first systematic scaling analysis for neuron-level representation learning, showing that increasing the number of animals used during pretraining consistently improves downstream performance. The learned representations are also label-efficient, requiring only a small fraction of labeled samples to achieve competitive performance. These results highlight how large, diverse neural datasets enable models to recover information about neuron identity that generalize across animals.

*Yi Fang,Haoran Xu,Jiaxin Han,Sirui Ding,Yizhi Wang,Yue Wang,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BioArc, a framework utilizing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to systematically design architectures for biological data rather than intuitively adopting general AI approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models from fields like NLP and CV face limitations when applied directly to biological data due to its unique properties such as long-range dependencies and complex underlying grammars.

Method: BioArc leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to analyze architecture, tokenization, and training strategies, optimizing designs specifically for biological data modalities.

Result: BioArc discovers high-performing architectures tailored to biological tasks and provides empirical design principles for future model development.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology represents a foundational resource for developing task-specific and general-purpose models for biology, enhancing biological data analysis frameworks.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). While efforts have been made to transfer the success of the foundation models in general AI domains to biology, existing works focus on directly adopting the existing foundation model architectures from general machine learning domains without a systematic design considering the unique physicochemical and structural properties of each biological data modality. This leads to suboptimal performance, as these repurposed architectures struggle to capture the long-range dependencies, sparse information, and complex underlying ``grammars'' inherent to biological data. To address this gap, we introduce BioArc, a novel framework designed to move beyond intuition-driven architecture design towards principled, automated architecture discovery for biological foundation models. Leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), BioArc systematically explores a vast architecture design space, evaluating architectures across multiple biological modalities while rigorously analyzing the interplay between architecture, tokenization, and training strategies. This large-scale analysis identifies novel, high-performance architectures, allowing us to distill a set of empirical design principles to guide future model development. Furthermore, to make the best of this set of discovered principled architectures, we propose and compare several architecture prediction methods that effectively and efficiently predict optimal architectures for new biological tasks. Overall, our work provides a foundational resource and a principled methodology to guide the creation of the next generation of task-specific and foundation models for biology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates the relationship between data heterogeneity and classification strategies, utilizing both structured and unstructured datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how data variety and type influence model performance, particularly in the context of infrastructure and algorithm choices.

Method: Dual strategy approach: using evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization for structured data, and distributed computational methods for unstructured text data.

Result: Linear models like SVM and Logistic Regression outperformed deep architectures in structured data, while simpler models offered better generalization in text domains due to Transformer-based embeddings and robust feature engineering.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a framework to select classification algorithms based on data type and computational limitations, emphasizing the 'complexity paradox' in high-dimensional datasets.

Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of heterogeneity ("Variety") in Big Data by comparing classification strategies across structured (Epsilon) and unstructured (Rest-Mex, IMDB) domains. A dual methodology was implemented: evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Genetic Algorithms, Optuna) in Python for numerical data, and distributed processing in Apache Spark for massive textual corpora. The results reveal a "complexity paradox": in high-dimensional spaces, optimized linear models (SVM, Logistic Regression) outperformed deep architectures and Gradient Boosting. Conversely, in text-based domains, the constraints of distributed fine-tuning led to overfitting in complex models, whereas robust feature engineering -- specifically Transformer-based embeddings (ROBERTa) and Bayesian Target Encoding -- enabled simpler models to generalize effectively. This work provides a unified framework for algorithm selection based on data nature and infrastructure constraints.

*Nguyen Ly,Caroline Tatsuoka,Jai Nagaraj,Jacob Levy,Fernando Palafox,David Fridovich-Keil,Hannah Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for learning and correcting non-autonomous vehicle dynamics using data-driven methodologies, addressing uncertainties in physics-based vehicle models and time-dependent control inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-based models of vehicle dynamics are often simplified, leading to uncertainties. Time-dependent control inputs make learning predictive models challenging, necessitating the development of accurate and efficient data-driven solutions.

Method: The authors reformulate vehicle dynamics using a local parameterization of time-dependent inputs, applying two approaches: DRIPS for efficient linear models and FML incorporating deep neural networks and transfer learning for nonlinear systems.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that DRIPS is robust and data-efficient for non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML handles nonlinear systems and corrects model errors even with limited high-fidelity data.

Conclusion: DRIPS and FML together provide complementary techniques for learning and correcting vehicle dynamics, offering solutions to challenges in model uncertainty and data scarcity.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for learning and correcting non-autonomous vehicle dynamics. Physics-based vehicle models are often simplified for tractability and therefore exhibit inherent model-form uncertainty, motivating the need for data-driven correction. Moreover, non-autonomous dynamics are governed by time-dependent control inputs, which pose challenges in learning predictive models directly from temporal snapshot data. To address these, we reformulate the vehicle dynamics via a local parameterization of the time-dependent inputs, yielding a modified system composed of a sequence of local parametric dynamical systems. We approximate these parametric systems using two complementary approaches. First, we employ the DRIPS (dimension reduction and interpolation in parameter space) methodology to construct efficient linear surrogate models, equipped with lifted observable spaces and manifold-based operator interpolation. This enables data-efficient learning of vehicle models whose dynamics admit accurate linear representations in the lifted spaces. Second, for more strongly nonlinear systems, we employ FML (Flow Map Learning), a deep neural network approach that approximates the parametric evolution map without requiring special treatment of nonlinearities. We further extend FML with a transfer-learning-based model correction procedure, enabling the correction of misspecified prior models using only a sparse set of high-fidelity or experimental measurements, without assuming a prescribed form for the correction term. Through a suite of numerical experiments on unicycle, simplified bicycle, and slip-based bicycle models, we demonstrate that DRIPS offers robust and highly data-efficient learning of non-autonomous vehicle dynamics, while FML provides expressive nonlinear modeling and effective correction of model-form errors under severe data scarcity.

TL;DR: LLMs show partial alignment with human brain representations, with deeper layers matching later brain responses, and this alignment depends on size and context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLMs and human brain share similar sequential computational processes and understand the underlying factors contributing to their alignment.

Method: Analyzing brain signals from participants listening to audiobooks and comparing against benchmark data from 22 different LLMs with varying architectures and sizes.

Result: Confirmed similarity in the sequence of computations between LLMs and brain dynamics; alignment is consistent across architectures but dependent on model size and context length.

Conclusion: Brain-LLM alignment reflects parallel computational processes, influenced by model size and context length. This provides insight into the convergent nature of biological and artificial networks.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the representations learned by large language models (LLMs) are partially aligned to those of the human brain. However, whether and why this alignment score arises from a similar sequence of computations remains elusive. In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiCoTS, a framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance multimodal time series forecasting by bridging text and time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in aligning distinct semantics of time series and text data by leveraging LLM capabilities for enhanced multimodal forecasting.

Method: The FiCoTS framework enables cross-modality interaction through three levels: token-level alignment using dynamic graphs, feature-level interaction with global cross-attention, and decision-level fusion with gated networks.

Result: FiCoTS outperforms existing models in extensive experiments across seven real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: FiCoTS demonstrates the effectiveness of combining text data with time series forecasting using LLM as an enhancer, presenting a robust prediction model for diverse applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to data analysis and web technologies. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant potential for this field, especially from the cross-modality aspect. Most methods adopt an LLM-as-Predictor paradigm, using LLM as the forecasting backbone and designing modality alignment mechanisms to enable LLM to understand time series data. However, the semantic information in the two modalities of time series and text differs significantly, making it challenging for LLM to fully understand time series data. To mitigate this challenge, our work follows an LLM-as-Enhancer paradigm to fully utilize the advantage of LLM in text understanding, where LLM is only used to encode text modality to complement time series modality. Based on this paradigm, we propose FiCoTS, an LLM-enhanced fine-to-coarse framework for multimodal time series forecasting. Specifically, the framework facilitates progressive cross-modality interaction by three levels in a fine-to-coarse scheme: First, in the token-level modality alignment module, a dynamic heterogeneous graph is constructed to filter noise and align time series patches with text tokens; Second, in the feature-level modality interaction module, a global cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enable each time series variable to connect with relevant textual contexts; Third, in the decision-level modality fusion module, we design a gated network to adaptively fuse the results of the two modalities for robust predictions. These three modules work synergistically to let the two modalities interact comprehensively across three semantic levels, enabling textual information to effectively support temporal prediction. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RGIA, an effective attack method to address privacy issues in federated reinforcement learning by reconstructing local private data through prior-knowledge-based regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the privacy risks associated with federated reinforcement learning's gradient sharing, particularly the challenge of ensuring reconstructed data aligns with real environment transition dynamics.

Method: The paper proposes Regularization Gradient Inversion Attack (RGIA), which applies prior-knowledge-based regularization during optimization on states, rewards, and transition dynamics.

Result: RGIA effectively reconstructs local private data by matching gradients and aligning data with true transition dynamics, as demonstrated on control tasks and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: RGIA narrows the solution space for reconstructed data, preserving privacy and ensuring accurate alignment with real transition dynamics, highlighting its utility in addressing this security concern.

Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) enables distributed learning of optimal policies while preserving local data privacy through gradient sharing.However, FRL faces the risk of data privacy leaks, where attackers exploit shared gradients to reconstruct local training data.Compared to traditional supervised federated learning, successful reconstruction in FRL requires the generated data not only to match the shared gradients but also to align with real transition dynamics of the environment (i.e., aligning with the real data transition distribution).To address this issue, we propose a novel attack method called Regularization Gradient Inversion Attack (RGIA), which enforces prior-knowledge-based regularization on states, rewards, and transition dynamics during the optimization process to ensure that the reconstructed data remain close to the true transition distribution.Theoretically, we prove that the prior-knowledge-based regularization term narrows the solution space from a broad set containing spurious solutions to a constrained subset that satisfies both gradient matching and true transition dynamics.Extensive experiments on control tasks and autonomous driving tasks demonstrate that RGIA can effectively constrain reconstructed data transition distributions and thus successfully reconstruct local private data.

*Haobin Ke,Sen Zhang,Qingqing Ye,Xun Ran,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ASGL, a privacy-preserving method for signed graph learning, addressing privacy concerns and achieving node-level differential privacy with high utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensitive data in signed graphs, used for modeling complex social networks, raises privacy concerns, prompting the need for differential privacy methods tailored for signed graphs.

Method: The ASGL approach uses adversarial learning, gradient perturbation, and signed graph decomposition into subgraphs to reduce sensitivity and effectively infer edge signs, while preserving node-level differential privacy.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ASGL provides favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across various tasks.

Conclusion: ASGL successfully balances privacy and utility in signed graph learning, leveraging adversarial methods and differential privacy solutions.

Abstract: Signed graphs with positive and negative edges can model complex relationships in social networks. Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.

*Eunjeong Jeong,Giovanni Perin,Howard H. Yang,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight client scheduling framework for Energy-Harvesting Federated Learning (EHFL) to reduce training energy costs while maintaining learning performance using a semantics-aware metric called Version Age of Information (VAoI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inefficiency of current EHFL strategies, which fail to consider the high energy costs of local updates, leading to wasted computational resources on edge devices.

Method: The framework leverages VAoI, a semantics-aware metric for assessing update timeliness and significance, alongside a novel feature-based proxy that minimizes computational complexity by extracting intermediate-layer features from a single forward pass.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method improves learning performance under non-IID data and limited energy conditions, achieving better energy efficiency compared to existing scheduling policies.

Conclusion: Semantics-aware scheduling using VAoI offers a practical and efficient solution for EHFL systems, especially for scenarios where energy-intensive training outweighs communication costs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KT methods lack explainability as they rely only on response correctness, ignoring rich data in students' problem-solving processes.

Method: The authors introduce StatusKT, a three-stage teacher-student-teacher LLM pipeline, to extract and evaluate problem-solving proficiency indicators, alongside KT-PSP and a new dataset KT-PSP-25.

Result: Experiments on KT-PSP-25 show StatusKT enhances prediction performance and offers interpretable explanations regarding students' mathematical proficiency.

Conclusion: StatusKT successfully addresses the limitation of explainability in KT by modeling students' multidimensional mathematical proficiency and improving predictions.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model student's knowledge state and predict future performance to enable personalized learning in Intelligent Tutoring Systems. However, traditional KT methods face fundamental limitations in explainability, as they rely solely on the response correctness, neglecting the rich information embedded in students' problem-solving processes. To address this gap, we propose Knowledge Tracing Leveraging Problem-Solving Process (KT-PSP), which incorporates students' problem-solving processes to capture the multidimensional aspects of mathematical proficiency. We also introduce KT-PSP-25, a new dataset specifically designed for the KT-PSP. Building on this, we present StatusKT, a KT framework that employs a teacher-student-teacher three-stage LLM pipeline to extract students' MP as intermediate signals. In this pipeline, the teacher LLM first extracts problem-specific proficiency indicators, then a student LLM generates responses based on the student's solution process, and a teacher LLM evaluates these responses to determine mastery of each indicator. The experimental results on KT-PSP-25 demonstrate that StatusKT improves the prediction performance of existing KT methods. Moreover, StatusKT provides interpretable explanations for its predictions by explicitly modeling students' mathematical proficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems, providing theoretical and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical investigation into real-world intelligence systems that require integration of offline learning and online adaptation for correlated and non-stationary data.

Method: The authors analyze generalization error during offline learning using Kullback-Leibler divergence for strongly correlated and shifted datasets and propose a meta-LMS algorithm for online adaptation to handle parameter drift.

Result: The two-stage offline-online framework shows superior prediction performance over standalone offline or online approaches, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Conclusion: A combined offline and online learning framework is effective in handling real-world conditions of non-stationarity and data correlation, offering improved prediction capabilities with robust theoretical support.

Abstract: Real-world intelligence systems usually operate by combining offline learning and online adaptation with highly correlated and non-stationary system data or signals, which, however, has rarely been investigated theoretically in the literature. This paper initiates a theoretical investigation on the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for a class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies. For the online-adaptation phase, we address, on the basis of the offline-trained model, the possible uncertain parameter drift in real-world target systems by proposing a meta-LMS prediction algorithm. This two-stage framework, integrating offline learning with online adaptation, demonstrates superior prediction performances compared with either purely offline or online methods. Both theoretical guarantees and empirical studies are provided.

*Na Li,Yuchen Jiao,Hangguan Shan,Shefeng Yan*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a memory-efficient algorithm, ME-Nash-QL, for two-player zero-sum Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning, overcoming existing computational and efficiency limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies and complexities in theoretical multi-agent reinforcement learning studies, such as memory issues, high sample and computational costs, and ineffective policy outputs.

Method: A model-free self-play algorithm, ME-Nash-QL, is introduced. It focuses on improving space complexity, computational efficiency, and burn-in cost for two-player Markov games.

Result: ME-Nash-QL achieves space complexity of O(SABH), simplifies sample complexity for long horizon settings with complexity of 𝑂̃(H⁴SAB/ε²), reduces computational complexity to O(Tpoly(AB)), and achieves the best burn-in cost.

Conclusion: The algorithm is proven more efficient than existing methods in terms of space, sample, and computational complexities, resolving several bottlenecks in MARL for two-player zero-sum Markov games.

Abstract: The thriving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) studies how a group of interacting agents make decisions autonomously in a shared dynamic environment. Existing theoretical studies in this area suffer from at least two of the following obstacles: memory inefficiency, the heavy dependence of sample complexity on the long horizon and the large state space, the high computational complexity, non-Markov policy, non-Nash policy, and high burn-in cost. In this work, we take a step towards settling this problem by designing a model-free self-play algorithm \emph{Memory-Efficient Nash Q-Learning (ME-Nash-QL)} for two-player zero-sum Markov games, which is a specific setting of MARL. ME-Nash-QL is proven to enjoy the following merits. First, it can output an $\varepsilon$-approximate Nash policy with space complexity $O(SABH)$ and sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(H^4SAB/\varepsilon^2)$, where $S$ is the number of states, $\{A, B\}$ is the number of actions for two players, and $H$ is the horizon length. It outperforms existing algorithms in terms of space complexity for tabular cases, and in terms of sample complexity for long horizons, i.e., when $\min\{A, B\}\ll H^2$. Second, ME-Nash-QL achieves the lowest computational complexity $O(T\mathrm{poly}(AB))$ while preserving Markov policies, where $T$ is the number of samples. Third, ME-Nash-QL also achieves the best burn-in cost $O(SAB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$, whereas previous algorithms have a burn-in cost of at least $O(S^3 AB\,\mathrm{poly}(H))$ to attain the same level of sample complexity with ours.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RTZ-VI-LCB, a model-based algorithm for robust offline multi-agent reinforcement learning in two-player zero-sum Markov games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the robustness of policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning under dynamic environmental uncertainties and distribution shifts, particularly in offline settings.

Method: The paper introduces RTZ-VI-LCB, which combines optimistic robust value iteration with a data-driven Bernstein-style penalty for robust value estimation in offline settings.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates near-optimal sample complexity guarantees under environmental uncertainty and partial dataset coverage, achieving state-of-the-art optimality.

Conclusion: RTZ-VI-LCB advances the field by achieving theoretically and experimentally validated robustness and efficiency in offline robust two-player zero-sum games, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), as a thriving field, explores how multiple agents independently make decisions in a shared dynamic environment. Due to environmental uncertainties, policies in MARL must remain robust to tackle the sim-to-real gap. We focus on robust two-player zero-sum Markov games (TZMGs) in offline settings, specifically on tabular robust TZMGs (RTZMGs). We propose a model-based algorithm (\textit{RTZ-VI-LCB}) for offline RTZMGs, which is optimistic robust value iteration combined with a data-driven Bernstein-style penalty term for robust value estimation. By accounting for distribution shifts in the historical dataset, the proposed algorithm establishes near-optimal sample complexity guarantees under partial coverage and environmental uncertainty. An information-theoretic lower bound is developed to confirm the tightness of our algorithm's sample complexity, which is optimal regarding both state and action spaces. To the best of our knowledge, RTZ-VI-LCB is the first to attain this optimality, sets a new benchmark for offline RTZMGs, and is validated experimentally.

### [454] [Learning Causal States Under Partial Observability and Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00357)
*Na Li,Hangguan Shan,Wei Ni,Wenjie Zhang,Xinyu Li,Yamin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaDiff, a framework enhancing reinforcement learning (RL) for noisy and partially observable environments by utilizing a novel diffusion model and bisimulation metric, showing improved performance experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reinforcement learning making decisions in incomplete, noisy, and partially observable environments, which current methods struggle to handle efficiently.

Method: The proposed method, CaDiff, uses an asynchronous diffusion model to suppress noise and employs a bisimulation metric to evaluate similarity between environments and causal counterparts, alongside theoretical guarantees for error bounds.

Result: CaDiff achieves an improvement of at least 14.18% in returns on Roboschool tasks compared to baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: CaDiff is a pioneering framework that integrates diffusion models to approximate causal states in RL with strong theoretical foundations and practical benefits.

Abstract: A critical challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) is making decisions based on incomplete and noisy observations, especially in perturbed and partially observable Markov decision processes (P$^2$OMDPs). Existing methods fail to mitigate perturbations while addressing partial observability. We propose \textit{Causal State Representation under Asynchronous Diffusion Model (CaDiff)}, a framework that enhances any RL algorithm by uncovering the underlying causal structure of P$^2$OMDPs. This is achieved by incorporating a novel asynchronous diffusion model (ADM) and a new bisimulation metric. ADM enables forward and reverse processes with different numbers of steps, thus interpreting the perturbation of P$^2$OMDP as part of the noise suppressed through diffusion. The bisimulation metric quantifies the similarity between partially observable environments and their causal counterparts. Moreover, we establish the theoretical guarantee of CaDiff by deriving an upper bound for the value function approximation errors between perturbed observations and denoised causal states, reflecting a principled trade-off between approximation errors of reward and transition-model. Experiments on Roboschool tasks show that CaDiff enhances returns by at least 14.18\% compared to baselines. CaDiff is the first framework that approximates causal states using diffusion models with both theoretical rigor and practicality.

*Wenshuo Wang,Yaomin Shen,Yingjie Tan,Yihao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents S^2-KD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that combines semantic and spectral representations to improve lightweight spatiotemporal forecasting models without additional complexity during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatiotemporal forecasting models are computationally intensive, and conventional knowledge distillation methods fail to capture semantic context and causal relationships behind visual patterns, limiting performance in complex scenarios.

Method: The framework uses a multimodal teacher model enhanced by textual narratives and spectral decoupling for training. A new distillation objective transfers this teacher's semantic and spectral knowledge to a simpler, vision-only student model.

Result: S^2-KD significantly enhances lightweight student models’ performance on benchmarks like WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ while excelling in long-horizon, non-stationary predictions.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic and spectral priors through the S^2-KD framework improves both accuracy and coherence in student models, making it a promising approach for efficient and effective spatiotemporal forecasting.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting often relies on computationally intensive models to capture complex dynamics. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a key technique for creating lightweight student models, with recent advances like frequency-aware KD successfully preserving spectral properties (i.e., high-frequency details and low-frequency trends). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by operating on pixel-level signals, leaving them blind to the rich semantic and causal context behind the visual patterns. To overcome this limitation, we introduce S^2-KD, a novel framework that unifies Semantic priors with Spectral representations for distillation. Our approach begins by training a privileged, multimodal teacher model. This teacher leverages textual narratives from a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) to reason about the underlying causes of events, while its architecture simultaneously decouples spectral components in its latent space. The core of our framework is a new distillation objective that transfers this unified semantic-spectral knowledge into a lightweight, vision-only student. Consequently, the student learns to make predictions that are not only spectrally accurate but also semantically coherent, without requiring any textual input or architectural overhead at inference. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like WeatherBench and TaxiBJ+ show that S^2-KD significantly boosts the performance of simple student models, enabling them to outperform state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-horizon and complex non-stationary scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance online RL efficiency by leveraging offline RL datasets, addressing gaps in existing online fine-tuning methods.

Method: Developed a framework integrating offline RL methods into online RL processes, with techniques to improve task performance and learning outcomes.

Result: Demonstrates task-specific effectiveness of the framework and its enhancements, but finds current online fine-tuning methods suboptimal.

Conclusion: Integrating offline RL can enhance online RL learning but requires task-sensitive applications and further improvement in fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: We take the novel perspective of incorporating offline RL algorithms as subroutines of tabula rasa online RL. This is feasible because an online learning agent can repurpose its historical interactions as offline dataset. We formalize this idea into a framework that accommodates several variants of offline RL incorporation such as final policy recommendation and online fine-tuning. We further introduce convenient techniques to improve its effectiveness in enhancing online learning efficiency. Our extensive and systematic empirical analyses show that 1) the effectiveness of the proposed framework depends strongly on the nature of the task, 2) our proposed techniques greatly enhance its effectiveness, and 3) existing online fine-tuning methods are overall ineffective, calling for more research therein.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The synthesis of molecules within constrained chemical spaces while meeting desired property criteria poses challenges in molecular discovery.

Method: PrexSyn utilizes a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale dataset of synthesizable pathways paired with properties, supported by high-throughput data generation for efficient property-pathway mapping.

Result: PrexSyn reconstructs synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly, supports programmable property-based molecule generation, and optimizes molecule designs efficiently.

Conclusion: PrexSyn advances synthesizable molecular design through enhanced chemical space coverage, sampling efficiency, and inference speed, setting a new benchmark.

Abstract: The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.

*Deep Patel,Emmanouil-Vasileios Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the convergence of gradient methods in non-convex min-max games between neural networks, introducing a hidden geometric structure and overparameterization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the convergence behavior of simple gradient methods in zero-sum neural network games, as these methods empirically succeed despite non-convex non-concave objectives.

Method: It provides sufficient conditions for global convergence to Nash Equilibria, develops a path-length bound for gradient descent-ascent, and utilizes random matrix theory to explain hidden convex-concave geometry.

Result: Proves that under overparameterization and specific conditions, gradient methods achieve global convergence in non-convex min-max games involving two-layer neural networks.

Conclusion: The findings establish a theoretic framework for explaining empirical observations, opening avenues for robust design in applications involving neural networks.

Abstract: Many emerging applications - such as adversarial training, AI alignment, and robust optimization - can be framed as zero-sum games between neural nets, with von Neumann-Nash equilibria (NE) capturing the desirable system behavior. While such games often involve non-convex non-concave objectives, empirical evidence shows that simple gradient methods frequently converge, suggesting a hidden geometric structure. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains this phenomenon through the lens of hidden convexity and overparameterization. We identify sufficient conditions - spanning initialization, training dynamics, and network width - that guarantee global convergence to a NE in a broad class of non-convex min-max games. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for games that involve two-layer neural networks. Technically, our approach is twofold: (a) we derive a novel path-length bound for the alternating gradient descent-ascent scheme in min-max games; and (b) we show that the reduction from a hidden convex-concave geometry to two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PŁ) min-max condition hold with high probability under overparameterization, using tools from random matrix theory.

*Zhikang Chen,Sen Cui,Deheng Ye,Min Zhang,Gang Niu,Yu Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new model merging methodology called 'Merging with Directional Alignment' which focuses on aligning directional structures in parameter and feature spaces to improve performance, addressing shortcomings of prior approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods fail to consider the critical role of directional information in parameter and feature spaces, which can lead to inconsistencies and degraded performance.

Method: The paper proposes a geometric framework called 'Merging with Directional Alignment', which ensures directional alignment to maintain coherence in both parameter and feature spaces during model merging.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance across benchmarks, model scales, and task configurations, achieving better coherence and effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Directional alignment is crucial in model merging, and the proposed framework offers a robust solution to improve structural coherence and performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a practical paradigm for integrating multiple independently trained models into a single model without joint retraining. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining parameters through strategies such as parameter decomposition, coefficient optimization, and subspace learning, significantly reducing the need for expensive joint training and achieving strong empirical performance across diverse tasks. However, these approaches predominantly treat merging as a problem of parameter space decomposition or fusion coefficient optimization, while overlooking the critical role of directional information in both parameter and feature spaces. In practice, naïve merging introduces inconsistencies in dominant parameter directions and disrupts structural coherence across models, which can degrade performance. Moreover, coefficient-based optimization methods implicitly assume compatible feature-space directions across models. However, Neural Collapse indicates that class features follow structured directional patterns, which may differ across independently trained models, making coefficient optimization alone insufficient. In this work, we emphasize the importance of \emph{directional alignment} and introduce a unified geometric framework, \emph{Merging with Directional Alignment} (\method{}), which aligns directional structures consistently in both the parameter and feature spaces. Our analysis shows that directional alignment improves structural coherence, and extensive experiments across benchmarks, model scales, and task configurations further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces resource-efficient 1D CNN models for on-device gait analysis in patients with Parkinson's Disease, achieving high accuracy with minimal computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient time-series analysis method for detecting gait in Parkinson's Disease that works on resource-constrained wearable devices.

Method: Comparing magnitude thresholding with three 1D CNN models (including two ultra-light models) using triaxial acceleration data, LOSO validation, and a chest-worn IMU dataset.

Result: The proposed ultra-light CNNs achieved high accuracy (PR-AUC > 94%, F1 > 91%) while being computationally efficient, using significantly fewer parameters compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Ultra-light separable CNNs offer strong accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for wearable Parkinson’s Disease gait detection and support edge deployment on constrained devices.

Abstract: We study on-device time-series analysis for gait detection in Parkinson's disease (PD) from short windows of triaxial acceleration, targeting resource-constrained wearables and edge nodes. We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies, lack of reproducibility, limited interaction with researchers, and narrow application in current LLM-based autonomous discovery systems.

Method: The authors develop SelfAI with three components: a User Agent for translating objectives, a Cognitive Agent with optimal stopping for hyperparameter search, and an Experiment Manager for structured workflows and parallel training.

Result: SelfAI outperforms traditional Bayesian optimization and LLM baselines in search diversity and discovery efficiency across diverse benchmarks including NLP, vision, and medical imaging.

Conclusion: SelfAI demonstrates robust performance across domains, reduces redundant trials, and effectively integrates human researcher interaction into the discovery process.

Abstract: Recent work on autonomous scientific discovery has leveraged LLM-based agents to integrate problem specification, experiment planning, and execution into end-to-end systems. However, these frameworks are often confined to narrow application domains, offer limited real-time interaction with researchers, and lack principled mechanisms for determining when to halt exploration, resulting in inefficiencies, reproducibility challenges, and under-utilized human expertise. To address these gaps, we propose \textit{SelfAI}, a general multi-agent platform that combines a User Agent for translating high-level research objectives into standardized experimental configurations, a Cognitive Agent powered by LLMs with optimal stopping criteria to iteratively refine hyperparameter searches, and an Experiment Manager responsible for orchestrating parallel, fault-tolerant training workflows across heterogeneous hardware while maintaining a structured knowledge base for continuous feedback. We further introduce two novel evaluation metrics, Score and $\text{AUP}_D$, to quantify discovery efficiency and search diversity. Across regression, NLP, computer vision, scientific computing, medical imaging, and drug discovery benchmarks, SelfAI consistently achieves strong performance and reduces redundant trials compared to classical Bayesian optimization and LLM-based baselines, while enabling seamless interaction with human researchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The persistent gap between mathematically optimal decisions by Digital Twins and human expectations necessitates embedding human-centered fairness in autonomous systems.

Method: The authors introduced a learning pipeline using a Siamese neural network to derive fairness objectives from human preferences and context, ensuring optimization aligns with human values.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated fairness integration in a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation use case, showing alignment with human perspectives while ensuring efficiency.

Conclusion: This work offers a viable method for embedding human-centered fairness into DT decision-making systems, bridging the algorithm-human gap in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers in complex socio-technical systems. Their mathematically optimal decisions often diverge from human expectations, exposing a persistent gap between algorithmic and bounded human rationality. This work addresses this gap by proposing a framework that operationalizes fairness as a learnable objective within optimization-based Digital Twins. We introduce a preference-driven learning pipeline that infers latent fairness objectives directly from human pairwise preferences over feasible decisions. A novel Siamese neural network is developed to generate convex quadratic cost functions conditioned on contextual information. The resulting surrogate objectives align optimization outcomes with human-perceived fairness while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach is demonstrated on a COVID-19 hospital resource allocation scenario. This study provides an actionable path toward embedding human-centered fairness in the design of autonomous decision-making systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based forecasting framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) for interpretable epidemic signal predictions, focusing on human behaviors and beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable forecasting models arises due to the insufficiency of black-box models and mechanistic approaches in understanding and predicting the dynamics of human beliefs and behaviors during epidemics.

Method: A graph of interrelated signals is constructed based on trend similarity, followed by the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) for signal prediction, thus enabling interpretation of key signals and relationships.

Result: The framework reveals which signals are more predictable and the relationships that contribute most to forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: The method sets a foundation for interpretable modeling in environments with interdependent signals, aiding in the integration of behavior, beliefs, and observations into simulation models.

Abstract: Epidemic outcomes have a complex interplay with human behavior and beliefs. Most of the forecasting literature has focused on the task of predicting epidemic signals using simple mechanistic models or black-box models, such as deep transformers, that ingest all available signals without offering interpretability. However, to better understand the mechanisms and predict the impact of interventions, we need the ability to forecast signals associated with beliefs and behaviors in an interpretable manner. In this work, we propose a graph-based forecasting framework that first constructs a graph of interrelated signals based on trend similarity, and then applies graph neural networks (GNNs) for prediction. This approach enables interpretable analysis by revealing which signals are more predictable and which relationships contribute most to forecasting accuracy. We believe our method provides early steps towards a framework for interpretable modeling in domains with multiple potentially interdependent signals, with implications for building future simulation models that integrate behavior, beliefs, and observations.

Motivation: The growing use of electronic patient records highlights the need for synthetic data to overcome privacy challenges while enabling machine learning development for personalized and accurate medical care.

Method: The authors enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model (TimeGAN) to process longitudinal clinical data and incorporate differential privacy safeguards, evaluated with statistical tests, synthetic-to-real data testing, and clinician reviews.

Result: The non-private Augmented TimeGAN outperformed other generative models in statistical metrics, while the private DP-TimeGAN achieved strong results on the privacy-utility frontier with a mean authenticity of 0.778 on chronic kidney disease data.

Conclusion: The models presented in this paper provide reliable synthetic data for medical workflows, supporting the development of machine learning approaches for chronic conditions while ensuring data privacy.

Abstract: Data privacy is a critical challenge in modern medical workflows as the adoption of electronic patient records has grown rapidly. Stringent data protection regulations limit access to clinical records for training and integrating machine learning models that have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and personalized care outcomes. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, current generative models either struggle with time-series data or lack formal privacy guaranties. In this paper, we enhance a state-of-the-art time-series generative model to better handle longitudinal clinical data while incorporating quantifiable privacy safeguards. Using real data from chronic kidney disease and ICU patients, we evaluate our method through statistical tests, a Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real (TSTR) setup, and expert clinical review. Our non-private model (Augmented TimeGAN) outperforms transformer- and flow-based models on statistical metrics in several datasets, while our private model (DP-TimeGAN) maintains a mean authenticity of 0.778 on the CKD dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models on the privacy-utility frontier. Both models achieve performance comparable to real data in clinician evaluations, providing robust input data necessary for developing models for complex chronic conditions without compromising data privacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether continuous-control tasks can be performed with discrete logic circuits, which offer interpretable, energy-efficient, and high-speed solutions, as opposed to traditional neural networks.

Method: Introduces DWCs, which utilize thermometer-encoded inputs, boolean lookup-table layers, and lightweight action heads. DWCs are trained using gradient-based techniques and can be compiled into energy-efficient FPGA-compatible circuits.

Result: DWCs achieve competitive performance on five MuJoCo benchmarks, matching full/quantized neural networks on four tasks and identifying network capacity limitations in HalfCheetah. DWCs also provide sparse, interpretable connectivity patterns.

Conclusion: DWCs present an alternative to neural networks by enabling energy-efficient, interpretable, and competitive continuous-control policies using discrete logic circuits.

Abstract: We investigate whether continuous-control policies can be represented and learned as discrete logic circuits instead of continuous neural networks. We introduce Differentiable Weightless Controllers (DWCs), a symbolic-differentiable architecture that maps real-valued observations to actions using thermometer-encoded inputs, sparsely connected boolean lookup-table layers, and lightweight action heads. DWCs can be trained end-to-end by gradient-based techniques, yet compile directly into FPGA-compatible circuits with few- or even single-clock-cycle latency and nanojoule-level energy cost per action. Across five MuJoCo benchmarks, including high-dimensional Humanoid, DWCs achieve returns competitive with weight-based policies (full precision or quantized neural networks), matching performance on four tasks and isolating network capacity as the key limiting factor on HalfCheetah. Furthermore, DWCs exhibit structurally sparse and interpretable connectivity patterns, enabling a direct inspection of which input thresholds influence control decisions.

### [466] [FairMT: Fairness for Heterogeneous Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00469)
*Guanyu Hu,Tangzheng Lian,Na Yan,Dimitrios Kollias,Xinyu Yang,Oya Celiktutan,Siyang Song,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairMT, a fairness-aware multi-task learning (MTL) framework addressing challenges like heterogeneity in tasks and partial labels, achieving substantial fairness improvements without compromising utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness studies focus mainly on single-task problems and fail to extend to heterogeneous multi-task settings with classification, detection, and regression tasks. Existing methods do not effectively address fairness across all task types and often compromise utility.

Method: FairMT employs an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism and head-aware multi-objective optimization. It consolidates asymmetric fairness violations into a holistic fairness constraint and optimizes fairness and utility together using a primal-dual formulation.

Result: FairMT demonstrated consistent and significant fairness improvements across three benchmarks featuring diverse tasks and modalities, without loss of performance in task utility.

Conclusion: The proposed FairMT framework bridges the gap in fairness research for multi-task learning, balancing utility and fairness while accommodating diverse task settings and label supervision.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning has been extensively studied in single-task settings, while fair multi-task learning (MTL), especially with heterogeneous tasks (classification, detection, regression) and partially missing labels, remains largely unexplored. Existing fairness methods are predominantly classification-oriented and fail to extend to continuous outputs, making a unified fairness objective difficult to formulate. Further, existing MTL optimization is structurally misaligned with fairness: constraining only the shared representation, allowing task heads to absorb bias and leading to uncontrolled task-specific disparities. Finally, most work treats fairness as a zero-sum trade-off with utility, enforcing symmetric constraints that achieve parity by degrading well-served groups. We introduce FairMT, a unified fairness-aware MTL framework that accommodates all three task types under incomplete supervision. At its core is an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Fairness Constraint Aggregation mechanism, which consolidates task-dependent asymmetric violations into a unified fairness constraint. Utility and fairness are jointly optimized via a primal--dual formulation, while a head-aware multi-objective optimization proxy provides a tractable descent geometry that explicitly accounts for head-induced anisotropy. Across three homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL benchmarks encompassing diverse modalities and supervision regimes, FairMT consistently achieves substantial fairness gains while maintaining superior task utility. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

*Yuepeng Sheng,Yuwei Huang,Shuman Liu,Haibo Zhang,Anxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ESPO, a new method for improving large language model reinforcement learning by addressing inefficiencies in current policy optimization frameworks, significantly enhancing performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimization trade-off in current frameworks like GSPO—between granularity and stability—leads to inefficiencies such as gradient underutilization and poor credit assignment to critical reasoning steps.

Method: The proposed ESPO framework uses entropy to group sequences and applies entropy-driven importance sampling and entropy-adaptive clipping to improve training stability and fine-grained optimization.

Result: ESPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including a 3x improvement in accuracy on the HMMT benchmark, from 4.4% to 13.13%.

Conclusion: ESPO effectively overcomes the balance between granularity and stability, offering a robust approach to enhance training efficiency and performance in LLM reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning has increasingly relied on group-based policy optimization frameworks, such as GRPO and GSPO, to achieve stable fine-tuning at scale. However, a fundamental trade-off persists between optimization granularity and training stability. While GSPO improves robustness via sequence-level optimization, its monolithic treatment of sequences introduces severe inefficiencies: its conservative clipping mechanism indiscriminately discards valid training samples-a phenomenon we term gradient underutilization-and its uniform credit assignment fails to capture the heterogeneous contributions of critical reasoning steps. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that reconciles fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy-driven Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy-adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ESPO not only accelerates convergence but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably improving accuracy on the challenging HMMT benchmark from 4.4% to 13.13%.

*Guangjie Zeng,Hao Peng,Angsheng Li,Li Sun,Chunyang Liu,Shengze Li,Yicheng Pan,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HypCSE, a novel hierarchical clustering method that operates in hyperbolic space while enhancing graph structures for improved clustering outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hierarchical clustering methods often lack a global objective and fail to effectively utilize graph structures.

Method: The authors propose HypCSE, which maps data points in hyperbolic space, employs continuous structural entropy (CSE) as an optimization objective, and dynamically learns graph structures during training using hyperbolic graph neural networks.

Result: HypCSE demonstrates superior clustering performance through experiments on seven datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating hyperbolic space mapping, continuous structural entropy, and graph structure learning allows HypCSE to effectively tackle the challenges in hierarchical clustering.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental machine-learning technique for grouping data points into dendrograms. However, existing hierarchical clustering methods encounter two primary challenges: 1) Most methods specify dendrograms without a global objective. 2) Graph-based methods often neglect the significance of graph structure, optimizing objectives on complete or static predefined graphs. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Continuous Structural Entropy neural networks, namely HypCSE, for structure-enhanced continuous hierarchical clustering. Our key idea is to map data points in the hyperbolic space and minimize the relaxed continuous structural entropy (SE) on structure-enhanced graphs. Specifically, we encode graph vertices in hyperbolic space using hyperbolic graph neural networks and minimize approximate SE defined on graph embeddings. To make the SE objective differentiable for optimization, we reformulate it into a function using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) on trees and then relax it into continuous SE (CSE) by the analogy of hyperbolic graph embeddings and partitioning trees. To ensure a graph structure that effectively captures the hierarchy of data points for CSE calculation, we employ a graph structure learning (GSL) strategy that updates the graph structure during training. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HypCSE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional QSAR models face challenges in effectively predicting bioactivity due to their limitations in capturing structural and contextual information of molecules.

Method: The proposed Rep3Net model integrates descriptor data, graph-based compound representations, and ChemBERTa SMILES embeddings as multimodal features for predictive analysis.

Result: Rep3Net achieves superior bioactivity prediction performance on the Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset, outperforming standalone models like GCN, GAT, and XGBoost.

Conclusion: Rep3Net offers a scalable, high-performing framework for computational compound screening in early-stage drug discovery, indicating its potential to enhance bioactivity prediction accuracy.

Abstract: In early stage drug discovery, bioactivity prediction of molecules against target proteins plays a crucial role. Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.

*Aaryan Gupta,Rishi Saket,Aravindan Raghuveer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient dataset distillation algorithms for regression and offline RL, enabling synthetic datasets to perform nearly as well as original ones by matching respective losses with sampled regressors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create synthetic datasets for supervised learning and offline RL that enable models trained on them to achieve comparable performance to those trained on original training datasets. This improves efficiency and scalability.

Method: The method involves matching losses on training and synthetic datasets using a fixed set of sampled regressors without requiring model training. It addresses regression using the MSE loss and offline RL using Bellman loss, leveraging rewards and next state information.

Result: The algorithm requires $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors and demonstrates tight theoretical guarantees with matching $Ω(d^2)$ lower bounds. It is extended for offline RL to match Bellman loss and validated via experiments, showing performance gains.

Conclusion: The study successfully develops and validates efficient algorithms for dataset distillation in supervised learning and offline RL, proving their theoretical soundness and practical benefits.

Abstract: Given a training dataset, the goal of dataset distillation is to derive a synthetic dataset such that models trained on the latter perform as well as those trained on the training dataset. In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $Ω(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis.
  Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical guarantees and observe performance gains.

*Akrati Saxena,Harshith Kumar Yadav,Bart Rutten,Shashi Shekhar Jha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DQ4FairIM, a novel fairness-aware influence maximization method using reinforcement learning, addressing structural inequalities in social networks and ensuring equitable influence distribution among minority and majority groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address structural inequalities in social networks where influence maximization methods often disproportionately benefit majority groups at the expense of minorities.

Method: The authors developed DQ4FairIM, a deep reinforcement learning-based approach incorporating a maximin fairness objective, utilizing deep Q-learning and Structure2Vec embedding to solve an influence maximization problem modeled as a Markov Decision Process.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show that DQ4FairIM outperforms both fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware baselines, achieving better fairness while maintaining an improved fairness-performance balance.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning approach not only ensures fairness in influence distribution across communities but also demonstrates strong generalization across different problem settings without retraining.

Abstract: The Influence Maximization (IM) problem aims to select a set of seed nodes within a given budget to maximize the spread of influence in a social network. However, real-world social networks have several structural inequalities, such as dominant majority groups and underrepresented minority groups. If these inequalities are not considered while designing IM algorithms, the outcomes might be biased, disproportionately benefiting majority groups while marginalizing minorities. In this work, we address this gap by designing a fairness-aware IM method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that ensures equitable influence outreach across all communities, regardless of protected attributes. Fairness is incorporated using a maximin fairness objective, which prioritizes improving the outreach of the least-influenced group, pushing the solution toward an equitable influence distribution. We propose a novel fairness-aware deep RL method, called DQ4FairIM, that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes by learning an RL policy. The learnt policy ensures that minority groups formulate the IM problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use deep Q-learning, combined with the Structure2Vec network embedding, earning together with Structure2Vec network embedding to solve the MDP. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world networks to compare our method with fairness-agnostic and fairness-aware baselines. The results show that our method achieves a higher level of fairness while maintaining a better fairness-performance trade-off than baselines. Additionally, our approach learns effective seeding policies that generalize across problem instances without retraining, such as varying the network size or the number of seed nodes.

TL;DR: The paper improves Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) to address transparency and fairness in machine learning, evaluating them on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'black-box' issue in machine learning models, especially for high-stakes applications, by improving transparency and fairness while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The study introduces three methodologies: Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, a multi-objective fairness optimization function, and a self-supervised pre-training pipeline for cold-starts.

Result: Evaluations showed slight ROC AUC improvements and meaningful changes in decision-making behavior, emphasizing multi-faceted evaluation over single metrics.

Conclusion: The work advances transparent, equitable, and robust machine learning models, aligning with regulatory and ethical demands.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of complex machine learning models in high-stakes domains has brought the "black-box" problem to the forefront of responsible AI research. This paper aims at addressing this issue by improving the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), a state-of-the-art glassbox model that delivers both high accuracy and complete transparency. The paper outlines three distinct enhancement methodologies: targeted hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian methods, the implementation of a custom multi-objective function for fairness for hyperparameter optimization, and a novel self-supervised pre-training pipeline for cold-start scenarios. All three methodologies are evaluated across standard benchmark datasets, including the Adult Income, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and UCI Heart Disease datasets. The analysis indicates that while the tuning process yielded marginal improvements in the primary ROC AUC metric, it led to a subtle but important shift in the model's decision-making behavior, demonstrating the value of a multi-faceted evaluation beyond a single performance score. This work is positioned as a critical step toward developing machine learning systems that are not only accurate but also robust, equitable, and transparent, meeting the growing demands of regulatory and ethical compliance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses instability in reinforcement learning algorithms by introducing the concept of 'list replicability' in the PAC RL framework, ensuring results are reproducible across different runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the instability and sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms to training conditions, which obstruct replicability and reliable outcomes.

Method: The researchers developed a new tabular RL algorithm with provable guarantees ensuring list complexity remains polynomial. They introduced a novel planning strategy based on lexicographic order and a mechanism for state-reachability testing.

Result: The proposed RL algorithm achieves list replicability in both weak and strong forms, maintaining polynomial list complexity. This result also empirically improves the stability of practical RL systems.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel framework for ensuring replicability in RL by addressing instability, providing theoretical and empirical advancements applicable to real-world RL implementations.

Abstract: Replicability is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), as RL algorithms are empirically observed to be unstable and sensitive to variations in training conditions. To formally address this issue, we study \emph{list replicability} in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) RL framework, where an algorithm must return a near-optimal policy that lies in a \emph{small list} of policies across different runs, with high probability. The size of this list defines the \emph{list complexity}. We introduce both weak and strong forms of list replicability: the weak form ensures that the final learned policy belongs to a small list, while the strong form further requires that the entire sequence of executed policies remains constrained. These objectives are challenging, as existing RL algorithms exhibit exponential list complexity due to their instability. Our main theoretical contribution is a provably efficient tabular RL algorithm that guarantees list replicability by ensuring the list complexity remains polynomial in the number of states, actions, and the horizon length. We further extend our techniques to achieve strong list replicability, bounding the number of possible policy execution traces polynomially with high probability. Our theoretical result is made possible by key innovations including (i) a novel planning strategy that selects actions based on lexicographic order among near-optimal choices within a randomly chosen tolerance threshold, and (ii) a mechanism for testing state reachability in stochastic environments while preserving replicability. Finally, we demonstrate that our theoretical investigation sheds light on resolving the \emph{instability} issue of RL algorithms used in practice. In particular, we show that empirically, our new planning strategy can be incorporated into practical RL frameworks to enhance their stability.

*Giovanni Conforti,Alain Durmus,Le-Tuyet-Nhi Pham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the theoretical framework of discrete diffusion models (DDMs), establishes convergence guarantees for finite and infinite discrete state spaces, and analyzes their efficiency in scaling with high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous diffusion models are well-studied, but the discrete case remains challenging due to its combinatorial structure and lacks rigorous analysis. This paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors focus on forward masked and random walk dynamics on discrete state spaces. They characterize the backward process with a discrete score function and derive error bounds. The complexity scales linearly with dimension, up to logarithmic factors.

Result: The paper establishes convergence guarantees for DDMs on spaces $\mathbb{Z}^d_m$ (finite) and $\mathbb{N}^d$ (infinite). It provides non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for various noising dynamics, including masking-based approaches.

Conclusion: This work marks a significant theoretical advancement in understanding discrete diffusion models. It presents scalable methods with rigorous guarantees, bridging the gap for discrete state spaces in diffusion models.

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical underpinnings of Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs) on discrete state spaces. Unlike in the continuous setting-where diffusion models are well understood both theoretically and empirically-the discrete case poses significant challenges due to its combinatorial structure and the lack of rigorous analysis. In this work, we establish convergence guarantees for DDMs on both the finite space $\mathbb{Z}^d_m=\{0,...,m-1\}^d$ and the countably infinite space $\mathbb{N}^d$ under mild assumptions, focusing on forward masked and random walk dynamics. Similar to the continuous case, the backward process can be characterized by a discrete score function, whose monotonicity plays a central role in deriving the error bounds of the generated data. Notably, the complexity of our model scales linearly up to logarithmic factors, rather than exponentially, with the dimension, making it efficiently scalable to high-dimensional data. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first non-asymptotic convergence guarantees that do not rely on the boundedness of the estimated score-covering not only uniform noising processes on $\mathbb{Z}^d_m$ and on $\mathbb{N}^d$, but also masking-based noising dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper explores Singular Learning Theory (SLT) to address challenges in modern neural networks, particularly around interpretability and phase transitions, performing experiments to understand factors like free energy and learning coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical statistical learning theories fail to explain the behavior of modern neural networks due to their singular nature. The paper aims to leverage SLT for a better understanding of network dynamics.

Method: The study tested SLT hypotheses using toy models of interpretability (grokking models, Toy Models of Superposition) and analyzed local learning coefficients across different network families such as polynomial regressors, low-rank networks, and autoencoders.

Result: The experiments confirmed certain scaling laws while also revealing deviations from predicted theoretical outcomes, offering insights into SLT's application.

Conclusion: The research highlights SLT's potential for understanding neural network phase transitions, but raises open questions for future theoretical and empirical work.

Abstract: Classical statistical inference and learning theory often fail to explain the success of modern neural networks. A key reason is that these models are non-identifiable (singular), violating core assumptions behind PAC bounds and asymptotic normality. Singular learning theory (SLT), a physics-inspired framework grounded in algebraic geometry, has gained popularity for its ability to close this theory-practice gap. In this paper, we empirically study SLT in toy settings relevant to interpretability and phase transitions. First, we understand the SLT free energy $\mathcal{F}_n$ by testing an Arrhenius-style rate hypothesis using both a grokking modulo-arithmetic model and Anthropic's Toy Models of Superposition. Second, we understand the local learning coefficient $λ_α$ by measuring how it scales with problem difficulty across several controlled network families (polynomial regressors, low-rank linear networks, and low-rank autoencoders). Our experiments recover known scaling laws while others yield meaningful deviations from theoretical expectations. Overall, our paper illustrates the many merits of SLT for understanding neural network phase transitions, and poses open research questions for the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for localized, high-resolution temperature forecasting, achieving accurate results for up to 48 hours and addressing the need for equitable forecasting in marginalized regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatwaves disproportionately affect marginalized populations and the Global South due to inadequate health systems, urban heat islands, and lack of adaptation infrastructure. Current weather prediction models fail at micro-scale extremes, leaving vulnerable populations without timely warnings.

Method: The paper proposes a Graph Neural Network framework that utilizes spatial learning and efficient computation. This model forecasts localized temperatures across multiple horizons (up to 48 hours) and is tested with 24-hour input windows in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.

Result: The model achieved strong performance, with a mean MAE of 1.93°C for 1-48 hour forecasts and an MAE@48h of 2.93°C in Southwestern Ontario.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the Graph Neural Network framework can successfully capture temperature patterns in a data-rich setting, providing a foundation for transfer learning approaches for equitable forecasting in data-limited areas.

Abstract: Heatwaves are intensifying worldwide and are among the deadliest weather disasters. The burden falls disproportionately on marginalized populations and the Global South, where under-resourced health systems, exposure to urban heat islands, and the lack of adaptive infrastructure amplify risks. Yet current numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture micro-scale extremes, leaving the most vulnerable excluded from timely early warnings. We present a Graph Neural Network framework for localized, high-resolution temperature forecasting. By leveraging spatial learning and efficient computation, our approach generates forecasts at multiple horizons, up to 48 hours. For Southwestern Ontario, Canada, the model captures temperature patterns with a mean MAE of 1.93$^{\circ}$C across 1-48h forecasts and MAE@48h of 2.93$^{\circ}$C, evaluated using 24h input windows on the largest region. While demonstrated here in a data-rich context, this work lays the foundation for transfer learning approaches that could enable localized, equitable forecasts in data-limited regions of the Global South.

TL;DR: The paper explores flow matching techniques for tabular data synthesis and demonstrates that flow matching (particularly TabbyFlow) outperforms diffusion models with better efficiency and utility-privacy trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and evaluate flow matching as an alternative to diffusion models for generating privacy-preserving tabular synthetic data.

Method: The paper compares flow matching (including variational FM) with diffusion models (TabDDPM and TabSyn), considering different probability paths (Optimal Transport and Variance Preserving) and deterministic/stochastic sampling methods.

Result: Flow matching methods, especially TabbyFlow, outperform diffusion baselines with fewer function evaluations and better utility-privacy trade-offs. Optimal Transport paths deliver superior performance, while Variance Preserving paths minimize disclosure risks. Stochastic flows enhance utility and privacy in some cases.

Conclusion: The study establishes the potential of flow matching as an effective and computationally efficient alternative to diffusion methods for tabular data synthesis. The choice of probability path and stochasticity also significantly influence outcomes.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation is an important tool for privacy-preserving data sharing. While diffusion models have set recent benchmarks, flow matching (FM) offers a promising alternative. This paper presents different ways to implement flow matching for tabular data synthesis. We provide a comprehensive empirical study that compares flow matching (FM and variational FM) with a state-of-the-art diffusion method (TabDDPM and TabSyn) in tabular data synthesis. We evaluate both the standard Optimal Transport (OT) and the Variance Preserving (VP) probability paths, and also compare deterministic and stochastic samplers -- something possible when learning to generate using \textit{variational} flow matching -- characterising the empirical relationship between data utility and privacy risk. Our key findings reveal that flow matching, particularly TabbyFlow, outperforms diffusion baselines. Flow matching methods also achieves better performance with remarkably low function evaluations ($\leq$ 100 steps), offering a substantial computational advantage. The choice of probability path is also crucial, as using the OT path demonstrates superior performance, while VP has potential for producing synthetic data with lower disclosure risk. Lastly, our results show that making flows stochastic not only preserves marginal distributions but, in some instances, enables the generation of high utility synthetic data with reduced disclosure risk.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how pre-curation of training data for neural PDE solvers can efficiently reduce computational costs, especially for high-difficulty tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the heavy computational cost associated with training data generation for neural PDE solvers while maximizing the benefits of machine learning in scenarios where classical solvers struggle.

Method: The study systematically assesses 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes problems of varying complexity by using a combination of classical and neural solvers, focusing on physics (Reynolds numbers) and geometries (obstacles).

Result: The research showed that combining low and medium difficulty samples can significantly lower computational costs (up to an 8.9x reduction) for high-difficulty tasks, achieving the same error rates.

Conclusion: Optimized allocation of compute resources for pre-generating PDE data is crucial and can lead to significant efficiency gains in developing effective neural PDE solvers.

Abstract: A key aspect of learned partial differential equation (PDE) solvers is that the main cost often comes from generating training data with classical solvers rather than learning the model itself. Another is that there are clear axes of difficulty--e.g., more complex geometries and higher Reynolds numbers--along which problems become (1) harder for classical solvers and thus (2) more likely to benefit from neural speedups. Towards addressing this chicken-and-egg challenge, we study difficulty transfer on 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes, systematically varying task complexity along geometry (number and placement of obstacles), physics (Reynolds number), and their combination. Similar to how it is possible to spend compute to pre-train foundation models and improve their performance on downstream tasks, we find that by classically solving (analogously pre-generating) many low and medium difficulty examples and including them in the training set, it is possible to learn high-difficulty physics from far fewer samples. Furthermore, we show that by combining low and high difficulty data, we can spend 8.9x less compute on pre-generating a dataset to achieve the same error as using only high difficulty examples. Our results highlight that how we allocate classical-solver compute across difficulty levels is as important as how much we allocate overall, and suggest substantial gains from principled curation of pre-generated PDE data for neural solvers.

### [479] [Bayesian dynamic scheduling of multipurpose batch processes under incomplete look-ahead information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01093)
*Taicheng Zheng,Dan Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method for multipurpose batch processes to address system disturbances effectively, leading to improved long-term costs and less disruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scheduling methods assume complete look-ahead information, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. This often results in suboptimal costs and excessive system nervousness.

Method: The proposed method uses Bayesian Networks to learn and update the probability distributions of disturbances and guides the rescheduling strategy based on real-time observations.

Result: The method outperforms periodic rescheduling strategies on benchmarks, achieving better long-term costs and lower system nervousness. It theoretically proves compatibility of Bayesian Networks under specific independence assumptions of disturbances.

Conclusion: This method offers a statistically better scheduling approach for dynamic environments and is extendable to other scheduling problems by customizing the dependency definitions for operations.

Abstract: Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.

### [480] [Statistical NLP for Optimization of Clinical Trial Success Prediction in Pharmaceutical R&D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00586)
*Michael R. Doane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops an NLP-based classifier to predict the probability of success for neuroscience clinical trials, achieving improved performance through a BioBERT-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pharmaceutical R&D, particularly in neuroscience, suffers from high attrition rates and costs. Identifying successful clinical trials early can optimize resource allocation and financial planning.

Method: Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Clinical Trial Outcome datasets were used. Text-based features were extracted through statistical NLP for models like logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest. A more advanced model leveraging BioBERT was developed for better predictions.

Result: Non-LLM models achieved a 0.64 ROC-AUC. The BioBERT-based model showed improved performance with a 0.74 ROC-AUC, a Brier Score of 0.185, and superior predictions 70% of the time over benchmarks.

Conclusion: NLP-enabled models, particularly the BioBERT-based approach, can significantly aid in neuroscience trial planning and resource allocation, improving success prediction and reducing risks.

Abstract: This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.

### [481] [Developing Fairness-Aware Task Decomposition to Improve Equity in Post-Spinal Fusion Complication Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00598)
*Yining Yuan,J. Ben Tamo,Wenqi Shi,Yishan Zhong,Micky C. Nnamdi,B. Randall Brenn,Steven W. Hwang,May D. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework for making equitable and interpretable postoperative complication severity predictions, showing enhanced performance and reduced bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address fairness issues in clinical prediction models, especially in high-stakes scenarios like spinal fusion surgery, where traditional approaches fail to capture the heterogeneity of patient populations and may perpetuate bias.

Method: FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven mechanism using demographic embeddings and k-means clustering to infer latent patient subgroups. Based on these inferred subgroups, it applies multitask learning with inverse frequency weighting to handle imbalances and regularization to avoid overfitting.

Result: FAIR-MTL achieves superior performance with an AUC of 0.86 and 75% accuracy for postoperative complication prediction. It significantly reduces demographic parity and equalized odds differences by leveraging subgroup fairness.

Conclusion: FAIR-MTL effectively integrates unsupervised subgroup identification into a multitask learning framework, providing equitable, interpretable, and clinically significant predictions, making it a valuable tool for surgical risk assessment.

Abstract: Fairness in clinical prediction models remains a persistent challenge, particularly in high-stakes applications such as spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis, where patient outcomes exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Many existing fairness approaches rely on coarse demographic adjustments or post-hoc corrections, which fail to capture the latent structure of clinical populations and may unintentionally reinforce bias. We propose FAIR-MTL, a fairness-aware multitask learning framework designed to provide equitable and fine-grained prediction of postoperative complication severity.
  Instead of relying on explicit sensitive attributes during model training, FAIR-MTL employs a data-driven subgroup inference mechanism. We extract a compact demographic embedding, and apply k-means clustering to uncover latent patient subgroups that may be differentially affected by traditional models. These inferred subgroup labels determine task routing within a shared multitask architecture. During training, subgroup imbalance is mitigated through inverse-frequency weighting, and regularization prevents overfitting to smaller groups.
  Applied to postoperative complication prediction with four severity levels, FAIR-MTL achieves an AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 75%, outperforming single-task baselines while substantially reducing bias. For gender, the demographic parity difference decreases to 0.055 and equalized odds to 0.094; for age, these values reduce to 0.056 and 0.148, respectively. Model interpretability is ensured through SHAP and Gini importance analyses, which consistently highlight clinically meaningful predictors such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and patient weight. Our findings show that incorporating unsupervised subgroup discovery into a multitask framework enables more equitable, interpretable, and clinically actionable predictions for surgical risk stratification.

*Berivan Isik,Matthew Fahrbach,Dima Kuzmin,Nicolas Mayoraz,Emil Praun,Steffen Rendle,Raghavendra Vasudeva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective two-stage paradigm for hyperparameter search in online learning systems, focusing on efficient configuration identification followed by selective full-scale training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost of model training in online learning applications, exacerbated by hyperparameter search, and to optimize these processes for shifting data distributions.

Method: The method involves a two-stage framework: (1) identifying efficient configurations using novel data reduction and prediction strategies, and (2) selectively training these configurations fully on sequential, non-stationary data.

Result: The framework successfully reduces hyperparameter search cost by up to 10x on the Criteo 1TB dataset and demonstrated validated efficiency gains on an industrial-level advertising system with much larger scale.

Conclusion: The two-stage paradigm is a validated, efficient approach for reducing hyperparameter search costs and enhancing operational efficiency in online learning systems while addressing non-stationary data challenges.

Abstract: Online learning is the cornerstone of applications like recommendation and advertising systems, where models continuously adapt to shifting data distributions. Model training for such systems is remarkably expensive, a cost that multiplies during hyperparameter search. We introduce a two-stage paradigm to reduce this cost: (1) efficiently identifying the most promising configurations, and then (2) training only these selected candidates to their full potential. Our core insight is that focusing on accurate identification in the first stage, rather than achieving peak performance, allows for aggressive cost-saving measures. We develop novel data reduction and prediction strategies that specifically overcome the challenges of sequential, non-stationary data not addressed by conventional hyperparameter optimization. We validate our framework's effectiveness through a dual evaluation: first on the Criteo 1TB dataset, the largest suitable public benchmark, and second on an industrial advertising system operating at a scale two orders of magnitude larger. Our methods reduce the total hyperparameter search cost by up to 10$\times$ on the public benchmark and deliver significant, validated efficiency gains in the industrial setting.

### [483] [Efficient Matroid Bandit Linear Optimization Leveraging Unimodality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00605)
*Aurélien Delage,Romaric Gaudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the combinatorial semi-bandit problem under matroid constraints, reducing time complexity while maintaining regret levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of current methods used in combinatorial semi-bandit problems with matroid constraints, where high time complexity is an issue, especially for large or costly matroids.

Method: The authors leverage the unimodal structure of matroid semi-bandit problems to limit the use of the membership oracle to \mathcal{O}(\log \log T) iterations, thereby reducing overall time complexity while retaining optimal regret.

Result: The proposed approach achieves no detectable increase in regret compared to state-of-the-art methods and significantly reduces time complexity and membership oracle calls in experiments on matroid benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper offers an efficient solution to the matroid semi-bandit problem, improving scalability and practicality without compromising performance.

Abstract: We study the combinatorial semi-bandit problem under matroid constraints. The regret achieved by recent approaches is optimal, in the sense that it matches the lower bound. Yet, time complexity remains an issue for large matroids or for matroids with costly membership oracles (e.g. online recommendation that ensures diversity). This paper sheds a new light on the matroid semi-bandit problem by exploiting its underlying unimodal structure. We demonstrate that, with negligible loss in regret, the number of iterations involving the membership oracle can be limited to \mathcal{O}(\log \log T)$. This results in an overall improved time complexity of the learning process. Experiments conducted on various matroid benchmarks show (i) no loss in regret compared to state-of-the-art approaches; and (ii) reduced time complexity and number of calls to the membership oracle.

*Medha Sawhney,Abhilash Neog,Mridul Khurana,Anuj Karpatne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISMA is a novel architecture that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model using attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling faster, more robust, and accurate inference compared to traditional optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based solvers for PDEs face challenges like slow optimization, instability, and inefficiency in handling noisy observations.

Method: PRISMA utilizes attention mechanisms in the spectral domain to integrate PDE residuals directly into its architecture, eliminating the need for gradient-based optimization during inference.

Result: Across five PDE benchmarks, PRISMA achieves competitive accuracy with 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, resulting in 15x to 250x faster inference, especially in noisy settings.

Conclusion: PRISMA offers a significant improvement in speed, stability, and accuracy for solving PDEs, making it highly effective and efficient compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Diffusion-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) are often bottle-necked by slow gradient-based test-time optimization routines that use PDE residuals for loss guidance. They additionally suffer from optimization instabilities and are unable to dynamically adapt their inference scheme in the presence of noisy PDE residuals. To address these limitations, we introduce PRISMA (PDE Residual Informed Spectral Modulation with Attention), a conditional diffusion neural operator that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model's architecture via attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling gradient-descent free inference. In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GGT-VAE, a model combining Generalized Graph Transformer and Variational Autoencoder for graph link prediction, emphasizing global self-attention and laplacian positional encoding without message passing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing GraphVAE, GCN, and GNN models in capturing relational dependencies and structural patterns in graph-structured data.

Method: GGT-VAE integrates a Generalized Graph Transformer with Variational Autoencoder, using global self-attention and laplacian positional encoding instead of traditional message-passing techniques.

Result: The proposed GGT-VAE model outperforms baselines in link prediction tasks, achieving higher ROC-AUC and Average Precision on various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining transformer-based architectures with variational frameworks for graph link prediction, offering an innovative alternative to message-passing approaches.

Abstract: Graph link prediction has long been a central problem in graph representation learning in both network analysis and generative modeling. Recent progress in deep learning has introduced increasingly sophisticated architectures for capturing relational dependencies within graph-structured data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Graph Transformer Variational Autoencoder (GGT-VAE). Our model integrates Generalized Graph Transformer Architecture with Variational Autoencoder framework for link prediction. Unlike prior GraphVAE, GCN, or GNN approaches, GGT-VAE leverages transformer style global self-attention mechanism along with laplacian positional encoding to model structural patterns across nodes into a latent space without relying on message passing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GGT-VAE consistently achieves above-baseline performance in terms of ROC-AUC and Average Precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to explore graph structure generation using a generalized graph transformer backbone in a variational framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAPS is a conformal regression method that provides narrower prediction intervals with reliable coverage, using a Gaussian posterior and posterior-aware conformity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for more efficient and accurate prediction intervals in small to medium tabular datasets, where uncertainty matters.

Method: CLAPS integrates split-conformal calibration with Last-Layer Laplace Approximation, defining a posterior CDF score based on Gaussian posterior information.

Result: CLAPS achieves nominal coverage with improved efficiency and narrower intervals across benchmarks, aided by a diagnostic suite for posterior behavior analysis.

Conclusion: CLAPS offers a practical improvement over residual-based conformal baselines with reliable coverage and enhanced efficiency in prediction intervals.

Abstract: We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment yields narrower prediction intervals at the same target coverage, especially on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling matters. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners understand why intervals shrink when they do. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS consistently attains nominal coverage with improved efficiency and minimal overhead, offering a clear, practical upgrade to residual-based conformal baselines.

Conclusion: Biologically-inspired predictive coding offers a promising solution to continual learning challenges, bridging neuroscience and AI for future research opportunities.

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence, with catastrophic forgetting posing a significant barrier to deploying neural networks in dynamic environments. Inspired by biological memory consolidation mechanisms, we propose a novel framework for generative replay that leverages predictive coding principles to mitigate forgetting. We present a comprehensive comparison between predictive coding-based and backpropagation-based gen- erative replay strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on task retention and transfer efficiency across multiple benchmark datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that predictive coding-based replay achieves superior retention performance (average 15.3% improvement) while maintaining competitive transfer efficiency, suggesting that biologically-inspired mechanisms can offer principled solutions to continual learning challenges. The proposed framework provides insights into the relationship between biological memory processes and artificial learning systems, opening new avenues for neuroscience-inspired AI research.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of Qwen3-8B for financial text classification and sentiment analysis, showing it surpasses other models in accuracy and efficiency while employing innovative fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance financial text classification and sentiment analysis for quantitative trading systems using advanced NLP models optimized for efficiency and reasoning.

Method: The paper fine-tunes the Qwen3-8B model with Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning, memory-efficient approaches like Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation, and FlashAttention.

Result: Qwen3-8B exceeds the performance of transformer models (T5, BERT, RoBERTa) and large-scale models (LLaMA, Baichuan) in accuracy and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Qwen3-8B is presented as a scalable and cost-efficient option for real-time financial applications, with promising implications for quantitative trading systems.

Abstract: Financial text classification has increasingly become an important aspect in quantitative trading systems and related tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis and the classification of financial news. In this paper, we assess the performance of the large language model Qwen3-8B on both tasks. Qwen3-8B is a state-of-the-art model that exhibits strong instruction-following and multilingual capabilities, and is distinct from standard models, primarily because it is specifically optimized for efficient fine tuning and high performance on reasoning-based benchmarks, making it suitable for financial applications. To adapt this model, we apply Noisy Embedding Instruction Finetuning and based on our previous work, this method increases robustness by injecting controlled noise into the embedding layers during supervised adaptation. We improve efficiency further with Rank-stabilized Low-Rank Adaptation low-rank optimization approach, and FlashAttention, which allow for faster training with lower GPU memory. For both tasks, we benchmark Qwen3-8B against standard classical transformer models, such as T5, BERT, and RoBERTa, and large models at scale, such as LLaMA1-7B, LLaMA2-7B, and Baichuan2-7B. The findings reveal that Qwen3-8B consistently surpasses these baselines by obtaining better classification accuracy and needing fewer training epochs. The synergy of instruction-based fine-tuning and memory-efficient optimization methods suggests Qwen3-8B can potentially serve as a scalable, economical option for real-time financial NLP applications. Qwen3-8B provides a very promising base for advancing dynamic quantitative trading systems in the future.

### [489] [Does Flatness imply Generalization for Logistic Loss in Univariate Two-Layer ReLU Network?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01473)
*Dan Qiao,Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the generalization phenomena of overparameterized two-layer ReLU neural networks using logistic loss and demonstrates that flat solutions do not always guarantee generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether flat solutions can generalize well when using logistic loss, since prior studies showed robust performance under square loss.

Method: Analyzed flat solutions with logistic loss using theoretical approaches and validated observations with simulation experiments.

Result: Flat solutions can generalize but only in specific regions; flat solutions at infinity may overfit, undermining generalization completely.

Conclusion: Flatness is not a sufficient criterion for generalization under logistic loss, calling for more nuanced approaches to evaluate generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalization of arbitrarily overparameterized two-layer ReLU Neural Networks with univariate input. Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general. We demonstrate the effects predicted by our theory in a well-controlled simulation study.

TL;DR: DP-FinDiff is a framework for privately generating tabular data, improving utility while ensuring privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enable the private and effective synthesis of mixed-type tabular data for safe sharing in sensitive domains like finance and medicine.

Method: The framework leverages embedding-based representations for categorical features and introduces two privacy-aware training strategies: adaptive timestep sampling and a feature-aggregated loss.

Result: Empirical results show DP-FinDiff achieving 16-42% higher utility compared to existing DP methods on financial and medical datasets.

Conclusion: DP-FinDiff demonstrates its capability to balance privacy and data utility, offering potential for applications in data-sensitive fields.

Abstract: We introduce DP-FinDiff, a differentially private diffusion framework for synthesizing mixed-type tabular data. DP-FinDiff employs embedding-based representations for categorical features, reducing encoding overhead and scaling to high-dimensional datasets. To adapt DP-training to the diffusion process, we propose two privacy-aware training strategies: an adaptive timestep sampler that aligns updates with diffusion dynamics, and a feature-aggregated loss that mitigates clipping-induced bias. Together, these enhancements improve fidelity and downstream utility without weakening privacy guarantees. On financial and medical datasets, DP-FinDiff achieves 16-42% higher utility than DP baselines at comparable privacy levels, demonstrating its promise for safe and effective data sharing in sensitive domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified multi-view diffusion framework using intertwined trajectories that allow better integration and analysis of multiple data views in manifold learning and data clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating multiple data views into a cohesive framework that captures their probabilistic, geometric interplay and improves manifold learning and clustering tasks.

Method: The method introduces Multi-view Diffusion Trajectories (MDTs), which iteratively fuse random walk operators of multiple data views, enabling probabilistic and geometric diffusion modeling. Theoretical properties like ergodicity are established, and diffusion distances and embeddings are derived.

Result: MDTs provide flexible ways of designing models and serve as a baseline for diffusion-based evaluations. Experiments validate effectiveness in manifold learning and data clustering applications.

Conclusion: MDTs enhance multi-view data integration by offering a theoretically grounded, flexible, and practical diffusion-based framework, demonstrating improvements in practical applications like clustering and manifold learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive unified framework for constructing multi-view diffusion geometries through intertwined multi-view diffusion trajectories (MDTs), a class of inhomogeneous diffusion processes that iteratively combine the random walk operators of multiple data views. Each MDT defines a trajectory-dependent diffusion operator with a clear probabilistic and geometric interpretation, capturing over time the interplay between data views. Our formulation encompasses existing multi-view diffusion models, while providing new degrees of freedom for view interaction and fusion. We establish theoretical properties under mild assumptions, including ergodicity of both the point-wise operator and the process in itself. We also derive MDT-based diffusion distances, and associated embeddings via singular value decompositions. Finally, we propose various strategies for learning MDT operators within the defined operator space, guided by internal quality measures. Beyond enabling flexible model design, MDTs also offer a neutral baseline for evaluating diffusion-based approaches through comparison with randomly selected MDTs. Experiments show the practical impact of the MDT operators in a manifold learning and data clustering context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing benchmarks that do not evaluate the complex planning capabilities needed for ML agents in orchestrating end-to-end data science workflows.

Method: A benchmark using 61 specialized tools and 15 challenges from Kaggle, incorporating in-memory object management. Proposed methods include shaped deterministic rewards and problem decomposition to tackle challenges in generating valid tool sequences.

Result: Significant improvement in tool sequence generation and task performance, with GPT-4o showing a 16.52 percentile median improvement over ReAct methods.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for the development of advanced tool-augmented ML agents capable of handling complex planning and iterative tasks in data science workflows.

Abstract: The development of autonomous machine learning (ML) agents capable of end-to-end data science workflows represents a significant frontier in artificial intelligence. These agents must orchestrate complex sequences of data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization, tasks that require sophisticated planning and iteration. While recent work on building ML agents has explored using large language models (LLMs) for direct code generation, tool-augmented approaches offer greater modularity and reliability. However, existing tool-use benchmarks focus primarily on task-specific tool selection or argument extraction for tool invocation, failing to evaluate the sophisticated planning capabilities required for ML Agents. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating tool-augmented ML agents using a curated set of 61 specialized tools and 15 tabular ML challenges from Kaggle. Our benchmark goes beyond traditional tool-use evaluation by incorporating an in-memory named object management, allowing agents to flexibly name, save, and retrieve intermediate results throughout the workflows. We demonstrate that standard ReAct-style approaches struggle to generate valid tool sequences for complex ML pipelines, and that tree search methods with LLM-based evaluation underperform due to inconsistent state scoring. To address these limitations, we propose two simple approaches: 1) using shaped deterministic rewards with structured textual feedback, and 2) decomposing the original problem into a sequence of sub-tasks, which significantly improves trajectory validity and task performance. Using GPT-4o, our approach improves over ReAct by 16.52 percentile positions, taking the median across all Kaggle challenges. We believe our work provides a foundation for developing more capable tool-augmented planning ML agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to ensure safe updates for machine learning models in dynamic environments by computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for safe model updates in safety-critical environments, addressing issues like catastrophic forgetting and alignment drift which current heuristics can't certify.

Method: The method formalizes the problem by identifying the largest locally invariant domain (LID) using relaxed parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) for tractability and efficient certification.

Result: The proposed method outperforms heuristic baselines, ensuring updates avoid forgetting and providing formal safety guarantees across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel, efficient framework for certified safe model updates, contributing significantly to machine learning in dynamic and evolving environments.

Abstract: Safety-critical environments are inherently dynamic. Distribution shifts, emerging vulnerabilities, and evolving requirements demand continuous updates to machine learning models. Yet even benign parameter updates can have unintended consequences, such as catastrophic forgetting in classical models or alignment drift in foundation models. Existing heuristic approaches (e.g., regularization, parameter isolation) can mitigate these effects but cannot certify that updated models continue to satisfy required performance specifications. We address this problem by introducing a framework for provably safe model updates. Our approach first formalizes the problem as computing the largest locally invariant domain (LID): a connected region in parameter space where all points are certified to satisfy a given specification. While exact maximal LID computation is intractable, we show that relaxing the problem to parameterized abstract domains (orthotopes, zonotopes) yields a tractable primal-dual formulation. This enables efficient certification of updates - independent of the data or algorithm used - by projecting them onto the safe domain. Our formulation further allows computation of multiple approximately optimal LIDs, incorporation of regularization-inspired biases, and use of lookahead data buffers. Across continual learning and foundation model fine-tuning benchmarks, our method matches or exceeds heuristic baselines for avoiding forgetting while providing formal safety guarantees.

TL;DR: This paper curates an enriched DAVIS dataset for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under biologically realistic conditions, proposing three benchmarks for model robustness evaluation and demonstrating strengths of docking-based and docking-free approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction overfit oversimplified datasets that lack representation of biologically relevant proteins, requiring a more comprehensive dataset for realistic evaluation.

Method: The authors curate a complete, modification-aware DAVIS dataset with 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs incorporating protein modifications like substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation. They propose three benchmark settings to evaluate model performance in handling protein modifications.

Result: Docking-based models exhibited better generalization in zero-shot scenarios, while docking-free models overfit to wild-type proteins but improved with fine-tuning on modified examples. The new dataset and benchmarks prove valuable for robustness evaluation.

Conclusion: The enriched dataset and benchmarks provide a platform to develop models that generalize well to protein modifications, potentially advancing precision medicine for drug discovery.

Abstract: Advancements in AI for science unlocks capabilities for critical drug discovery tasks such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. However, current models overfit to existing oversimplified datasets that does not represent naturally occurring and biologically relevant proteins with modifications. In this work, we curate a complete and modification-aware version of the widely used DAVIS dataset by incorporating 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs involving substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation events. This enriched dataset enables benchmarking of predictive models under biologically realistic conditions. Based on this new dataset, we propose three benchmark settings-Augmented Dataset Prediction, Wild-Type to Modification Generalization, and Few-Shot Modification Generalization-designed to assess model robustness in the presence of protein modifications. Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery.

Result: The newly developed DiffSAC, DiffPPO, and DiffWPO outperform baseline methods (SAC and PPO) on standard continuous control benchmarks, delivering better returns and higher sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based modifications to existing RL algorithms offer principled improvements in performance, demonstrating the potential of diffusion dynamics in reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in data-driven learning and in sampling from complex, unnormalized target distributions. Building on this progress, we reinterpret Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntRL) as a diffusion model-based sampling problem. We tackle this problem by minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion policy and the optimal policy distribution using a tractable upper bound. By applying the policy gradient theorem to this objective, we derive a modified surrogate objective for MaxEntRL that incorporates diffusion dynamics in a principled way. This leads to simple diffusion-based variants of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), termed DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO. All of these methods require only minor implementation changes to their base algorithm. We find that on standard continuous control benchmarks, DiffSAC, DiffPPO and DiffWPO achieve better returns and higher sample efficiency than SAC and PPO.

### [496] [Exploiting Function-Family Structure in Analog Circuit Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00712)
*Zhuohua Liu,Kaiqi Huang,Qinxin Mei,Yuanqi Hu,Wei W. Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Circuit Prior Network (CPN), a method for analog circuit optimization leveraging pre-trained tabular models to outperform traditional Gaussian Process (GP) surrogates in nonlinear circuit optimization with small samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box optimization methods for analog circuits rely on smooth global priors, which fail to model highly nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics, essential for accurate performance mapping in realistic scenarios.

Method: The authors propose CPN, combining a tabular foundation model (TabPFN v2) with Direct Expected Improvement (DEI) to compute exact discrete posteriors and match structured circuit dynamics without hand-crafted engineering.

Result: CPN achieves a $R^2 \approx 0.99$ versus $R^2 = 0.16$ for GP-Matérn in small-sample regimes and delivers up to 3.81x higher efficiency while using significantly fewer iterations, demonstrating its superiority in circuit optimization.

Conclusion: The results advocate for a shift toward systematic physics-informed prior identification over traditional hand-crafted models, showcasing CPN's ability to reliably optimize circuits in challenging design scenarios.

Abstract: Analog circuit optimization is typically framed as black-box search over arbitrary smooth functions, yet device physics constrains performance mappings to structured families: exponential device laws, rational transfer functions, and regime-dependent dynamics. Off-the-shelf Gaussian-process surrogates impose globally smooth, stationary priors that are misaligned with these regime-switching primitives and can severely misfit highly nonlinear circuits at realistic sample sizes (50--100 evaluations). We demonstrate that pre-trained tabular models encoding these primitives enable reliable optimization without per-circuit engineering. Circuit Prior Network (CPN) combines a tabular foundation model (TabPFN v2) with Direct Expected Improvement (DEI), computing expected improvement exactly under discrete posteriors rather than Gaussian approximations. Across 6 circuits and 25 baselines, structure-matched priors achieve $R^2 \approx 0.99$ in small-sample regimes where GP-Matérn attains only $R^2 = 0.16$ on Bandgap, deliver $1.05$--$3.81\times$ higher FoM with $3.34$--$11.89\times$ fewer iterations, and suggest a shift from hand-crafting models as priors toward systematic physics-informed structure identification. Our code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

*Fanlong Zeng,Wensheng Gan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPAIACL, a method leveraging contrastive learning to tackle covariate distribution shifts in graph neural networks (GNNs), demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness on OOD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariate distribution shifts, a common issue with real-world graph data, are inadequately addressed by existing GNNs and methods. The paper aims to fully utilize the latent space's rich information to improve performance.

Method: The proposed method, MPAIACL, employs a contrastive learning approach to leverage intrinsic information in vector representations, enhancing the model's ability to address covariate shifts.

Result: MPAIACL shows robust performance in addressing out-of-distribution problems, outperforming existing baselines across multiple public OOD datasets.

Conclusion: MPAIACL effectively addresses covariate shifts with its novel use of contrastive learning, providing a compelling tool for better handling OOD challenges in GNNs. Its code is open-source for further exploration.

Abstract: Covariate distribution shift occurs when certain structural features present in the test set are absent from the training set. It is a common type of out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, frequently encountered in real-world graph data with complex structures. Existing research has revealed that most out-of-the-box graph neural networks (GNNs) fail to account for covariate shifts. Furthermore, we observe that existing methods aimed at addressing covariate shifts often fail to fully leverage the rich information contained within the latent space. Motivated by the potential of the latent space, we introduce a new method called MPAIACL for More Powerful Adversarial Invariant Augmentation using Contrastive Learning. MPAIACL leverages contrastive learning to unlock the full potential of vector representations by harnessing their intrinsic information. Through extensive experiments, MPAIACL demonstrates its robust generalization and effectiveness, as it performs well compared with other baselines across various public OOD datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/MPAIACL.

*Lingling Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach to improve robustness and efficiency in RLHF reward models and mitigate reward hacking while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of reward hacking in RLHF reward models and to reduce the computational overhead typically introduced by MoE-based architectures.

Method: The method involves upcycling a dense reward model to a MoE architecture with specialized experts, followed by routing-weight normalization and merging back into a dense model via a learnable weight-averaging mechanism.

Result: The proposed approach effectively mitigates reward hacking and maintains performance gains across various scales of models, while significantly reducing inference costs.

Conclusion: Upcycle and merge MoE architectures can enhance the robustness and efficiency of RLHF reward models, showing potential for future applications in reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: Reward models play a critical role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by assessing the consistency between generated outputs and human preferences. However, conventional reward models are prone to reward hacking or over-optimization, where the policy exploits shortcut patterns to obtain high reward scores that do not reflect true human preference. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based reward models can enhance discriminative capability, they typically introduce substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an upcycle and merge MoE reward modeling approach. We first upcycle a dense reward model into a MoE architecture, where a shared expert captures general knowledge, while normal experts specialize in instruction-specific patterns. We then apply routing-weight normalization and merge experts back into a dense model through a learnable weight-averaging mechanism, preserving performance gains while significantly reducing inference cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates reward hacking across various model scales. Our work highlights the potential of upcycle and merge MoE structures for improving both robustness and efficiency of RLHF reward models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for user-driven clustering, allowing custom semantic criteria, and introduces methods to enhance clustering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Typical deep clustering methods have limited adaptability, providing one result per dataset due to fixed data distribution assumptions, which may not meet diverse user needs.

Method: The proposed method uses hidden states from MLLMs' text tokens for feature-specific embeddings, paired with a lightweight clustering head and pseudo-label learning to execute user-defined clustering.

Result: Experiments show the method achieves competitive accuracy and performance across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: MLLMs can enable user-driven clustering with improved adaptability and accuracy, demonstrating their potential in flexible and task-specific clustering scenarios.

Abstract: Typical deep clustering methods, while achieving notable progress, can only provide one clustering result per dataset. This limitation arises from their assumption of a fixed underlying data distribution, which may fail to meet user needs and provide unsatisfactory clustering outcomes. Our work investigates how multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can be leveraged to achieve user-driven clustering, emphasizing their adaptability to user-specified semantic requirements. However, directly using MLLM output for clustering has risks for producing unstructured and generic image descriptions instead of feature-specific and concrete ones. To address these issues, our method first discovers that MLLMs' hidden states of text tokens are strongly related to the corresponding features, and leverages these embeddings to perform clusterings from any user-defined criteria. We also employ a lightweight clustering head augmented with pseudo-label learning, significantly enhancing clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance on diverse datasets and metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize the value of wind energy by enhancing energy storage dispatch strategies and power generation modeling using localized data and synthetic atmospheric conditions.

Method: Developed two deep learning models: COVE-NN, an LSTM-based dispatch framework for individual wind farms, and a power generation modeling framework optimized for accuracy and power curve similarity.

Result: COVE-NN reduced annual COVE by 32.3% over 43 years at the Pyron site, and the modeling framework improved RMSE by 9.5% and power curve similarity by 18.9% in validation at Palouse wind farm.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks provide more robust data-driven strategies for wind energy dispatch and generation, with potential applications in renewable energy systems.

Abstract: Wind farms with integrated energy storage, or hybrid wind farms, are able to store energy and dispatch it to the grid following an operational strategy. For individual wind farms with integrated energy storage capacity, data-driven dispatch strategies using localized grid demand and market conditions as input parameters stand to maximize wind energy value. Synthetic power generation data modeled on atmospheric conditions provide another avenue for improving the robustness of data-driven dispatch strategies. To these ends, the present work develops two deep learning frameworks: COVE-NN, an LSTM-based dispatch strategy tailored to individual wind farms, which reduced annual COVE by 32.3% over 43 years of simulated operations in a case study at the Pyron site; and a power generation modeling framework that reduced RMSE by 9.5% and improved power curve similarity by 18.9% when validated on the Palouse wind farm. Together, these models pave the way for more robust, data-driven dispatch strategies and potential extensions to other renewable energy systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces REM, a benchmark to test the spatial reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), revealing existing limitations and encouraging advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To spotlight the limitations of MLLMs in spatial reasoning—a foundational skill for embodied applications—and drive research to enhance their understanding of spatial concepts.

Method: The authors developed REM, a benchmark leveraging controllable 3D environments to systematically evaluate MLLMs on spatial reasoning tasks like object permanence, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking.

Result: Current leading MLLMs show promising performance but struggle with even moderate complexity, highlighting key limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: REM underscores significant gaps in MLLMs’ spatial reasoning capabilities and offers targeted diagnostics to drive improvements in future models.

Abstract: Humans build viewpoint-independent cognitive maps through navigation, enabling intuitive reasoning about object permanence and spatial relations. We argue that multimodal large language models (MLLMs), despite extensive video training, lack this fundamental spatial reasoning capability, a critical limitation for embodied applications. To demonstrate these limitations and drive research, we introduce REM (Reasoning over Embodied Multi-Frame Trajectories), a benchmark using controllable 3D environments for long-horizon embodied spatial reasoning. REM systematically evaluates key aspects like object permanence/distinction, spatial relationships, and numerical tracking across dynamic embodied viewpoints. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing current models exhibit promising overall performance, but become increasingly unreliable at even moderate complexity levels easily handled by humans. These findings highlight challenges MLLMs face in developing robust spatial representations from sequential visual input. Consequently, REM provides targeted metrics and diagnostics to foster improved spatial understanding in future models.

*Zongjian Han,Yiran Liang,Ruiwen Wang,Yiwei Luo,Yilin Huang,Xiaotong Song,Dongqing Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a neural network approach to prevent model collapse in generative models during recursive training without increasing the sample size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of model collapse in generative models and eliminate the need for increasing sample sizes during training.

Method: A neural network filter method was developed to actively learn contraction conditions, supported by specialized neural architectures and loss functions, ensuring unbiased estimation within a fixed sample size framework.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows convergence of estimation errors under constant sample size settings, and experimental results validate the approach's effectiveness in learning contraction conditions and preventing model collapse.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a practical, end-to-end solution for generative model training without requiring increasing sample size growth, achieving theoretical and empirical success.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network filter method based on contraction operators to address model collapse in recursive training of generative models. Unlike \cite{xu2024probabilistic}, which requires superlinear sample growth ($O(t^{1+s})$), our approach completely eliminates the dependence on increasing sample sizes within an unbiased estimation framework by designing a neural filter that learns to satisfy contraction conditions. We develop specialized neural network architectures and loss functions that enable the filter to actively learn contraction conditions satisfying Assumption 2.3 in exponential family distributions, thereby ensuring practical application of our theoretical results. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that when the learned contraction conditions are satisfied, estimation errors converge probabilistically even with constant sample sizes, i.e., $\limsup_{t\to\infty}\mathbb{P}(\|\mathbf{e}_t\|>δ)=0$ for any $δ>0$. Experimental results show that our neural network filter effectively learns contraction conditions and prevents model collapse under fixed sample size settings, providing an end-to-end solution for practical applications.

### [503] [Forecasting India's Demographic Transition Under Fertility Policy Scenarios Using hybrid LSTM-PINN Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00760)
*Subarna Khanra,Vijay Kumar Kukreja,Indu Bala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid model combining Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demographic forecasting in India, considering fertility-policy scenarios over 2024-2054.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of accurate demographic forecasting in India, driven by complex interactions between fertility transitions, policy interventions, and age-structured dynamics.

Method: A hybrid modelling framework is developed integrating PINNs with LSTM networks to incorporate physical constraints and temporal patterns. India's population data and policy scenarios are incorporated into a transport-reaction partial differential equation.

Result: The model demonstrates how varying fertility policies significantly influence future age structures, dependency ratios, and workforce size, showcasing different impacts of stricter versus relaxed fertility policies.

Conclusion: This research validates the hybrid LSTM-PINN approach for accurate, interpretable demographic forecasting and emphasizes balanced fertility policies for sustainable socio-economic development in India.

Abstract: Demographic forecasting remains a fundamental challenge for policy planning in rapidly evolving nations such as India, where fertility transitions, policy interventions, and age structured dynamics interact in complex ways. In this study, we present a hybrid modelling framework that integrates policy-aware fertility functions into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) enhanced with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture physical constraints and temporal dependencies in population dynamics. The model is applied to India's age structured population from 2024 to 2054 under three fertility-policy scenarios: continuation of current fertility decline, stricter population control, and relaxed fertility promotion. The governing transport-reaction partial differential equation is formulated with India-specific demographic indicators, including age-specific fertility and mortality rates. PINNs embed the core population equation and policy-driven fertility changes, while LSTM layers improve long-term forecasting across decades. Results show that fertility policies substantially shape future age distribution, dependency ratios, and workforce size. Stricter controls intensify ageing and reduce labour force participation, whereas relaxed policies support workforce growth but increase population pressure. Our findings suggest that the hybrid LSTM-PINN is an effective approach for demographic forecasting, offering accuracy with interpretability. Beyond methodological novelty, this work provides actionable insights for India's demographic policy debates, highlighting the need for balanced fertility interventions to ensure sustainable socio-economic development.

*Robin Yadav,Shuo Xie,Tianhao Wang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the advantages of adaptive optimization algorithms like Adam in language modeling tasks and proposes using $l_infty$-norm descent to account for heavy-tailed class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive optimization methods outperform GD in LLMs, but their benefits under heavy-tailed class imbalance need clarification.

Method: The paper analyzes $l_infty$-norm descent's performance by proposing a minimal setting for next-token prediction under imbalanced distributions.

Result: It demonstrates faster convergence for $l_infty$-norm-based methods compared to normalized GD in the presence of heavy-tailed class imbalance.

Conclusion: Adaptive methods like $l_infty$-norm descent are more effective than GD in specific data distribution scenarios, advancing understanding of optimization in LLM tasks.

Abstract: Adaptive optimization methods (such as Adam) play a major role in LLM pretraining, significantly outperforming Gradient Descent (GD). Recent studies have proposed new smoothness assumptions on the loss function to explain the advantages of adaptive algorithms with structured preconditioners, e.g., coordinate-wise or layer-wise, and steepest descent methods w.r.t. non-euclidean norms, e.g., $\ell_\infty$ norm or spectral norm, over GD. However, it remains unclear how these smoothness assumptions manifest in language modelling tasks. In this work, we aim to analyze the benefit of $\ell_\infty$-norm descent (a.k.a. sign descent) directly from properties of the data distribution, namely, heavy-tailed class imbalance. We propose a minimal yet representative setting of next-token prediction, where we can provably show faster convergence of coordinate-wise algorithms such as Sign descent (steepest descent w.r.t. $\ell_\infty$ norm) over normalized GD (steepest descent w.r.t. to $\ell_2$ norm) in the presence of heavy tail class imbalance.

TL;DR: The research focuses on how digital health systems and chatbots interpret patient symptoms, utilizing various NLP methods to analyze medical conversations and symptom patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the growing role of chatbots in healthcare and their capability to interpret patient-reported symptoms within tele-health frameworks.

Method: Utilized NLP techniques including LDA for latent themes, K-Means clustering, Transformer-based NER for medical concepts, and Apriori algorithm for frequent symptom pairs using a dataset of 960 multi-turn dialogues.

Result: Identified structured clinical topics, clusters of symptom descriptions, and confirmed symptom relationships with high confidence, enhancing diagnostic signal extraction.

Conclusion: Conversational data from medical bots can be transformed into actionable diagnostic insights, improving tele-health interactions and diagnostic frameworks for future medical chatbot developments.

Abstract: The fast growth of digital health systems has led to a need to better comprehend how they interpret and represent patient-reported symptoms. Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology. By demonstrating a method for converting unstructured free-flowing dialogue into actionable knowledge regarding symptoms this work provides an extensible framework to further enhance future performance, dependability and clinical utility of selecting medical chatbots.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI framework using reinforcement learning to optimize parameter configurations for radio astronomy source-extraction programs, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of finding optimal parameter configurations for source extraction programs in large-scale sky surveys, especially for complex setups like SoFiA, as manual tuning is non-trivial.

Method: An AI agent based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm interacts with the environment, learning to adjust and optimize parameters using feedback from the SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset.

Result: The AI framework successfully identifies optimal parameter configurations outperforming the SoFiA benchmark in fewer steps and with less time consumption on the evaluation dataset.

Conclusion: This RL-based framework offers a generalizable solution for automatic parameter tuning in data-intensive fields, though it depends on high-quality training sets and ground truth data for implementation.

Abstract: Source extraction is crucial in analyzing data from next-generation, large-scale sky surveys in radio bands, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the optimization dynamics of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), two preference optimization (PO) methods for large language models, and uncovers their distinct behaviors and impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of deeper analyses regarding the differences between DPO and PPO and to enhance the understanding of these PO methods for large language models.

Method: The authors conducted analyses of the optimization dynamics, examining gradient-based update targets, roles of positive/negative learning, and loss reweighting, complemented by ablation studies to assess impacts on efficiency and performance.

Result: The study reveals that DPO has stable learning targets and loss reweighting mitigates overfitting, while PPO uses dynamic targets and focuses on exploration. Each method exhibits distinct mechanisms for leveraging learning components.

Conclusion: The research advances understanding of the fundamental differences between DPO and PPO, providing insights to improve preference optimization methods for aligning large language models with user expectations.

Abstract: Preference optimization (PO) is indispensable for large language models (LLMs), with methods such as direct preference optimization (DPO) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) achieving great success. A common belief is that DPO is supervised learning while PPO is reinforcement learning, yet deeper analyses for the reasons underlying these differences remain lacking. To fill this gap, we analyze their optimization dynamics, revealing distinct algorithmic behaviors and comprehending their underlying causes. First, we examine the target directions of gradient-based updates and find that DPO follows stable targets, whereas PPO follows dynamic targets that balance exploration and exploitation, thus validating the common belief from a new perspective. Second, we examine the roles of positive learning, negative learning, and loss reweighting, which are three key components in PO methods. Our analyses reveal that these components play fairly different roles. In DPO, positive and negative learning jointly shape the learning targets meanwhile mutually offset each other. However, loss reweighting in DPO acts less as a reward signal but more as a regularizer to mitigate overfitting. In PPO, negative learning primarily supports exploration rather than determining the targets. Meanwhile, loss reweighting, related to absolute values of token-level advantages, indicates the distinct roles of token groups in updating targets. Given these findings, we conduct carefully designed ablation studies to further examine how controlling these dynamics impacts optimization efficiency and practical performance. The insights gained from our analyses not only deepen the understanding of PO methods but also inspire the development of more preference-aligned LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in humanoid robots' cognitive systems, specifically in creating a dynamic thought space between semantics and control.

Method: Developed the "Sigma" VLA model, trained on annotated datasets with improved architecture, leveraging preprocessing and LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Sigma reduced motion control errors (MSE), maintained semantic-text alignment, and demonstrated mind-responsive alignment.

Conclusion: The study validates that Sigma enables efficient semantic alignment and intention-driven behavior, contributing reproducible findings to the field.

Abstract: To address the gap in humanoid robot cognitive systems regarding the lack of a time-updable mediating thought space between semantics and continuous control, this study constructs and trains a VLA model named "Sigma" that runs on a single RTX 4090. It uses the open-source pi05_base model as a foundation and preprocesses svla_so101_pickplace into a training dataset. The researcher independently designed an architecture for a vision-language-action model that combines deep semantic understanding and association to achieve telepathic communication. The training process involved repeated optimizations of data preprocessing, LoRA fine-tuning, and the inference-stage adapter. The experiment employed offline closed-loop replay, comparing Sigma with the untuned pure pi05_base_base model under data conditions. Results showed that Sigma exhibited a stable decrease in control MSE across vector, fragment, and entire trajectory timescales, while maintaining the telepathy norm and semantic-text alignment quality unchanged. It demonstrates that mind-responsive alignment control is quantified through an architecture that combines deep understanding of semantics and association without retraining the base model, which provides reproducible experience for semantic alignment and intention-driven behavior in humanoid robots.

*Jordi Pérez-Guijarro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether training and test distributions must be identical for optimal generalization, and surprisingly finds that they don't always need to match, based on certain assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding generalization in settings where training and test distributions differ, a common but complex challenge in machine learning.

Method: The study explores theoretical concepts and employs assumptions like the existence of one-way functions to examine the interplay between training and test distributions.

Result: The findings reveal that matching distributions is not always optimal under specific conditions, contradicting common beliefs in machine learning. Uniform distribution restores standard results under imposed regularities.

Conclusion: Training and test distributions being identical is not universally optimal, and exceptions exist depending on the assumptions and regularities of target functions.

Abstract: When the distributions of the training and test data do not coincide, the problem of understanding generalization becomes considerably more complex, prompting a variety of questions. In this work, we focus on a fundamental one: Is it always optimal for the training distribution to be identical to the test distribution? Surprisingly, assuming the existence of one-way functions, we find that the answer is no. That is, matching distributions is not always the best scenario, which contrasts with the behavior of most learning methods. Nonetheless, we also show that when certain regularities are imposed on the target functions, the standard conclusion is recovered in the case of the uniform distribution.

### [510] [Estimating the Effective Rank of Vision Transformers via Low-Rank Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00792)
*Liyu Zerihun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to estimate the "intrinsic dimensionality" of deep networks by analyzing their learned low-rank representations through weight factorization and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to better understand the intrinsic dimensionality of over-parameterized deep networks, which often exhibit low-rank structures in their learned representations.

Method: They factorize a trained teacher model's weights into multiple ranks, train each factorized model (student) via distillation, and analyze performance as a function of rank. They define "effective rank" and "effective knee" metrics to interpret rank-performance trade-offs.

Result: On ViT-B/32 trained on CIFAR-100, they demonstrate that effective-rank lies within [16, 34] and the effective knee occurs around 31. The student achieves 69.46% accuracy (94.7% of the teacher's accuracy) while significantly reducing parameters.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical framework to characterize intrinsic dimensionality in deep models, helping to optimize model compression and understand representational efficiency.

Abstract: Deep networks are heavily over-parameterized, yet their learned representations often admit low-rank structure. We introduce a framework for estimating a model's intrinsic dimensionality by treating learned representations as projections onto a low-rank subspace of the model's full capacity. Our approach: train a full-rank teacher, factorize its weights at multiple ranks, and train each factorized student via distillation to measure performance as a function of rank.
  We define effective rank as a region, not a point: the smallest contiguous set of ranks for which the student reaches 85-95% of teacher accuracy. To stabilize estimates, we fit accuracy vs. rank with a monotone PCHIP interpolant and identify crossings of the normalized curve. We also define the effective knee as the rank maximizing perpendicular distance between the smoothed accuracy curve and its endpoint secant; an intrinsic indicator of where marginal gains concentrate.
  On ViT-B/32 fine-tuned on CIFAR-100 (one seed, due to compute constraints), factorizing linear blocks and training with distillation yields an effective-rank region of approximately [16, 34] and an effective knee at r* ~ 31. At rank 32, the student attains 69.46% top-1 accuracy vs. 73.35% for the teacher (~94.7% of baseline) while achieving substantial parameter compression. We provide a framework to estimate effective-rank regions and knees across architectures and datasets, offering a practical tool for characterizing the intrinsic dimensionality of deep models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Causal Cooperative Game (CCG) framework to enhance multi-label classification (MLC), addressing label imbalance and distribution shifts, and improving rare label prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in MLC, such as label imbalance, spurious correlations, and distribution shifts, especially for rare label prediction.

Method: The proposed CCG framework integrates causal discovery (using Neural Structural Equation Models) with a counterfactual curiosity reward for robust feature learning, causal invariance loss for generalization, and a strategy focused on rare label enhancement.

Result: CCG demonstrates significant improvements over baselines in rare label prediction and overall robustness, supported by extensive benchmarking, ablation studies, and qualitative analysis.

Conclusion: Combining causal inference with cooperative game theory improves multi-label learning, showcasing the efficacy and interpretability of the proposed CCG framework.

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) remains vulnerable to label imbalance, spurious correlations, and distribution shifts, challenges that are particularly detrimental to rare label prediction. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal Cooperative Game (CCG) framework, which conceptualizes MLC as a cooperative multi-player interaction. CCG unifies explicit causal discovery via Neural Structural Equation Models with a counterfactual curiosity reward to drive robust feature learning. Furthermore, it incorporates a causal invariance loss to ensure generalization across diverse environments, complemented by a specialized enhancement strategy for rare labels. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that CCG substantially outperforms strong baselines in both rare label prediction and overall robustness. Through rigorous ablation studies and qualitative analysis, we validate the efficacy and interpretability of our components, underscoring the potential of synergizing causal inference with cooperative game theory for advancing multi-label learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReJump, a new tool to study the reasoning processes of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by mapping their thought processes onto a tree-like structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of how Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reason and solve complex problems, despite their success, by developing a framework that can analyze and quantify their behavior.

Method: ReJump encodes the reasoning process of LRMs as a sequence of node transitions in a tree structure representing intermediate problem-solving steps. It quantifies reasoning using metrics like exploration and verification. Experiments with ReJump analyze reasoning behaviors across different LRMs, tasks, and learning strategies.

Result: ReJump unveils distinct reasoning styles among models with similar accuracies and varying preferences depending on the task. It also enables the study of differences between distilled models, CoT-prompted LLMs, and LRMs. Moreover, ReJump enhances reasoning quality by guiding test-time strategies.

Conclusion: ReJump provides insights into LRM reasoning and serves as a tool to refine their performance through better understanding and application of their reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are Large Language Models (LLMs) explicitly trained to generate long-form Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), achieving impressive success on challenging tasks like math and programming. However, their underlying reasoning "algorithms" remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we propose ReJump, which represents a reasoning trace as a visitation order over nodes in a tree of intermediate problem-solving steps. Transitions between nodes, which we term jumps, include adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as calculation, and non-adjacent moves that capture behaviors such as backtracking and verification. ReJump enables analyzing LLM reasoning with diverse metrics that quantify exploration, exploitation, overthinking, forgetting, and verification. Using our proposed LLM agent to extract reasoning traces into ReJump format, we evaluate state-of-the-art LRMs on two tasks and find that models with similar accuracy can exhibit distinct reasoning behaviors, while different tasks favor different reasoning styles (e.g., varying balance between exploration and exploitation). To further understand how learning strategies shape reasoning, we use ReJump to compare distilled LRMs with their teachers, CoT-prompted LLMs with LRMs, and to examine how the number of reasoning examples and reinforcement learning affect reasoning behavior. Finally, we show that ReJump can improve reasoning quality at test time through strategies such as ReJump-guided Best-of-N selection and prompt selection. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/ReJump.

*Adriel Sosa Marco,John Daniel Kirwan,Alexia Toumpa,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCNF is a novel post hoc method for uncertainty quantification in deep regression models that provides prediction intervals and predictive distributions without retraining existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an uncertainty quantification method that captures multimodal or asymmetric distributions for safer decision-making and avoids retraining model architectures.

Method: Proposing MCNF, a post hoc uncertainty quantification method that works on trained predictive models to generate calibrated and detailed uncertainty estimates and predictive distributions.

Result: The MCNF method showed competitive calibration and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while requiring no retraining of models.

Conclusion: MCNF offers a practical and effective uncertainty quantification approach with richer distributional insights, enhancing safe decision-making in complex domains.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in deep regression models is important both for understanding the confidence of the model and for safe decision-making in high-risk domains. Existing approaches that yield prediction intervals overlook distributional information, neglecting the effect of multimodal or asymmetric distributions on decision-making. Similarly, full or approximated Bayesian methods, while yielding the predictive posterior density, demand major modifications to the model architecture and retraining. We introduce MCNF, a novel post hoc uncertainty quantification method that produces both prediction intervals and the full conditioned predictive distribution. MCNF operates on top of the underlying trained predictive model; thus, no predictive model retraining is needed. We provide experimental evidence that the MCNF-based uncertainty estimate is well calibrated, is competitive with state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods, and provides richer information for downstream decision-making tasks.

### [514] [Prediction-space knowledge markets for communication-efficient federated learning on multimedia tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00841)
*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KTA v2 enhances federated learning by sharing logits instead of full model weights, addressing issues of statistical heterogeneity and communication constraints. It outperforms traditional methods under low communication budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address statistical heterogeneity and high communication overhead in federated learning, especially for large models under non-IID data conditions.

Method: It introduces KTA v2, where clients train locally, share logits on a public reference set, and receive personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation. This approach combines client similarity graphs with reference-set accuracy for better model updates.

Result: KTA v2 outperformed baselines like FedAvg and FedProx, achieving significant communication efficiency and improved accuracy, such as 57.7% on CIFAR-10 and 89.3% on AG News with fractions of FedAvg's communication cost.

Conclusion: KTA v2 achieves effective federated learning with reduced communication costs and improved performance, making it a viable alternative to traditional parameter-averaging methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training over distributed multimedia data but suffers acutely from statistical heterogeneity and communication constraints, especially when clients deploy large models. Classic parameter-averaging methods such as FedAvg transmit full model weights and can diverge under nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose KTA v2, a prediction-space knowledge trading market for FL. Each round, clients locally train on their private data, then share only logits on a small public reference set. The server constructs a client-client similarity graph in prediction space, combines it with reference-set accuracy to form per-client teacher ensembles, and sends back personalized soft targets for a second-stage distillation update. This two-stage procedure can be interpreted as approximate block-coordinate descent on a unified objective with prediction-space regularization. Experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10 and AG News show that, under comparable or much lower communication budgets, KTA v2 consistently outperforms a local-only baseline and strong parameter-based methods (FedAvg, FedProx), and substantially improves over a FedMD-style global teacher. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, KTA v2 reaches 57.7% test accuracy using approximately 1/1100 of FedAvg's communication, while on AG News it attains 89.3% accuracy with approximately 1/300 of FedAvg's traffic.

*Yunbo Long,Jiaquan Zhang,Xi Chen,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces gravitational federated clustering (GFC), a method for clustering non-IID data in federated settings under local differential privacy (LDP), combining privacy preservation and accuracy using a novel physics-inspired approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an urgent need to address challenges posed by clustering non-independent data under LDP, where balancing privacy and accuracy without iterative communication presents critical difficulties.

Method: GFC involves two main innovations: a client-side perturbation mechanism encoding local cluster geometry and a server-side topological aggregation using persistent homology analysis to identify stable centroids.

Result: GFC outperformed state-of-the-art privacy-preserving clustering methods in benchmarks, especially under strong privacy constraints ($ε< 1$), while showing competitive performance under lower privacy budgets.

Conclusion: GFC redefines federated clustering via a physics-inspired framework that achieves remarkable privacy-accuracy trade-offs without the need for iterative communication, providing new directions for distributed learning.

Abstract: Clustering non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data under local differential privacy (LDP) in federated settings presents a critical challenge: preserving privacy while maintaining accuracy without iterative communication. Existing one-shot methods rely on unstable pairwise centroid distances or neighborhood rankings, degrading severely under strong LDP noise and data heterogeneity. We present Gravitational Federated Clustering (GFC), a novel approach to privacy-preserving federated clustering that overcomes the limitations of distance-based methods under varying LDP. Addressing the critical challenge of clustering non-IID data with diverse privacy guarantees, GFC transforms privatized client centroids into a global gravitational potential field where true cluster centers emerge as topologically persistent singularities. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a client-side compactness-aware perturbation mechanism that encodes local cluster geometry as "mass" values, and (2) a server-side topological aggregation phase that extracts stable centroids through persistent homology analysis of the potential field's superlevel sets. Theoretically, we establish a closed-form bound between the privacy budget $ε$ and centroid estimation error, proving the potential field's Lipschitz smoothing properties exponentially suppress noise in high-density regions. Empirically, GFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ten benchmarks, especially under strong LDP constraints ($ε< 1$), while maintaining comparable performance at lower privacy budgets. By reformulating federated clustering as a topological persistence problem in a synthetic physics-inspired space, GFC achieves unprecedented privacy-accuracy trade-offs without iterative communication, providing a new perspective for privacy-preserving distributed learning.

### [516] [City-Conditioned Memory for Multi-City Traffic and Mobility Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00851)
*Wenzhang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CityCond introduces a lightweight memory layer for city-conditioned data augmentation to address spatio-temporal forecasting in diverse urban setups, showing consistent improvements across backbones in various data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce complexities associated with deploying traffic forecasting models in cities with varying network topologies and data availability, while also improving transferability to data-scarce regions.

Method: CityCond integrates a city-ID encoder with a shared memory bank (CityMem) to produce city-conditioned features. It augments existing backbones like GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, and STGCN.

Result: The CityCond layer consistently boosts performance, with Transformer and STGCN showing the largest error reductions. CityMem significantly benefits low-data and cross-city scenarios, reducing errors by nearly one-third in full-data settings.

Conclusion: CityCond serves as a scalable and reusable solution for multi-city spatio-temporal forecasting, improving accuracy and transferability while minimizing maintenance costs.

Abstract: Deploying spatio-temporal forecasting models across many cities is difficult: traffic networks differ in size and topology, data availability can vary by orders of magnitude, and new cities may provide only a short history of logs. Existing deep traffic models are typically trained per city and backbone, creating high maintenance cost and poor transfer to data-scarce cities. We ask whether a single, backbone-agnostic layer can condition on "which city this sequence comes from", improve accuracy in full- and low-data regimes, and support better cross-city adaptation with minimal code changes.
  We propose CityCond, a light-weight city-conditioned memory layer that augments existing spatio-temporal backbones. CityCond combines a city-ID encoder with an optional shared memory bank (CityMem). Given a city index and backbone hidden states, it produces city-conditioned features fused through gated residual connections. We attach CityCond to five representative backbones (GRU, TCN, Transformer, GNN, STGCN) and evaluate three regimes: full-data, low-data, and cross-city few-shot transfer on METR-LA and PEMS-BAY. We also run auxiliary experiments on SIND, a drone-based multi-agent trajectory dataset from a signalized intersection in Tianjin (we focus on pedestrian tracks).
  Across more than fourteen model variants and three random seeds, CityCond yields consistent improvements, with the largest gains for high-capacity backbones such as Transformers and STGCNs. CityMem reduces Transformer error by roughly one third in full-data settings and brings substantial gains in low-data and cross-city transfer. On SIND, simple city-ID conditioning modestly improves low-data LSTM performance. CityCond can therefore serve as a reusable design pattern for scalable, multi-city forecasting under realistic data constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses probabilistic forecasting using the REFIT household dataset with a focus on imputation and model evaluation, finding Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) as the superior model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance modern risk management by providing reliable probabilistic forecasts, particularly in datasets with structural data gaps like REFIT.

Method: Conducted a comparative experiment for seasonal imputation selection, evaluated classical (SARIMA, Prophet), machine learning (XGBoost), and deep learning architectures (LSTM, TFT).

Result: Found classical models inadequate for capturing non-linear patterns. LSTM offered the best-calibrated probabilistic predictions, while TFT excelled in accuracy (RMSE 481.94) and cautious volatility capture.

Conclusion: Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is the most effective model for accurate and robust probabilistic forecasting in challenging datasets.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is essential for modern risk management, allowing decision-makers to quantify uncertainty in critical systems. This paper tackles this challenge using the volatile REFIT household dataset, which is complicated by a large structural data gap. We first address this by conducting a rigorous comparative experiment to select a Seasonal Imputation method, demonstrating its superiority over linear interpolation in preserving the data's underlying distribution. We then systematically evaluate a hierarchy of models, progressing from classical baselines (SARIMA, Prophet) to machine learning (XGBoost) and advanced deep learning architectures (LSTM). Our findings reveal that classical models fail to capture the data's non-linear, regime-switching behavior. While the LSTM provided the most well-calibrated probabilistic forecast, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) emerged as the superior all-round model, achieving the best point forecast accuracy (RMSE 481.94) and producing safer, more cautious prediction intervals that effectively capture extreme volatility.

### [518] [The Spectral Dimension of NTKs is Constant: A Theory of Implicit Regularization, Finite-Width Stability, and Scalable Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00860)
*Praveen Anilkumar Shukla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the complexity of modern, overparameterized deep networks through the effective rank of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) Gram matrix. Empirical evidence and theoretical results highlight low intrinsic complexity in these networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how heavily overparameterized neural networks manage to generalize well, despite having large parameter counts, pointing to the existence of a lower intrinsic complexity in these systems.

Method: The researchers focus on analyzing the effective rank of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) Gram matrix at initialization. They derive theoretical results for infinite-width NTKs, establish stability conditions for finite-width NTKs, and propose a scalable estimator to measure effective rank, validated on real-world datasets like CIFAR-10.

Result: Theoretically, the paper derives a constant-limit law for effective rank at initialization. Empirical results on ResNet-20/56 with CIFAR-10 data show that the effective rank remains consistent across varying dataset sizes, supporting theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The effective rank of the NTK reveals a low intrinsic complexity in overparameterized networks, providing a partial explanation for their surprising generalization performance. This establishes a new perspective on analyzing neural network complexity through kernel-based methods.

Abstract: Modern deep networks are heavily overparameterized yet often generalize well, suggesting a form of low intrinsic complexity not reflected by parameter counts. We study this complexity at initialization through the effective rank of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) Gram matrix, $r_{\text{eff}}(K) = (\text{tr}(K))^2/\|K\|_F^2$. For i.i.d. data and the infinite-width NTK $k$, we prove a constant-limit law $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[r_{\text{eff}}(K_n)] = \mathbb{E}[k(x, x)]^2 / \mathbb{E}[k(x, x')^2] =: r_\infty$, with sub-Gaussian concentration. We further establish finite-width stability: if the finite-width NTK deviates in operator norm by $O_p(m^{-1/2})$ (width $m$), then $r_{\text{eff}}$ changes by $O_p(m^{-1/2})$. We design a scalable estimator using random output probes and a CountSketch of parameter Jacobians and prove conditional unbiasedness and consistency with explicit variance bounds. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-20/56 (widths 16/32) across $n \in \{10^3, 5\times10^3, 10^4, 2.5\times10^4, 5\times10^4\}$, we observe $r_{\text{eff}} \approx 1.0\text{--}1.3$ and slopes $\approx 0$ in $n$, consistent with the theory, and the kernel-moment prediction closely matches fitted constants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HBLLM, a wavelet-enhanced method for 1-bit post-training quantization of Large Language Models, which improves performance by using Haar wavelet transforms and novel grouping strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantizing models to 1-bit without significant loss in performance remains a challenge in reducing the storage and computational cost of large language models.

Method: HBLLM integrates Haar wavelet transforms to optimize frequency decomposition, utilizes two grouping strategies for weights (frequency-aware intra-row grouping and saliency-driven column selection), and employs shared mean quantization for non-salient weights.

Result: HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 1-bit quantization, with a perplexity of 6.71 on LLaMA2-13B and an average weight storage of 1.08 bits.

Conclusion: HBLLM provides a highly efficient quantization method that enhances the storage and computational efficiency of LLMs with minimal fidelity loss, setting a benchmark for future quantization techniques.

Abstract: We introduce HBLLM, a wavelet-enhanced high-fidelity $1$-bit post-training quantization method for Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging Haar wavelet transforms to enhance expressive capacity through frequency decomposition, HBLLM significantly improves quantization fidelity while maintaining minimal overhead. This approach features two innovative structure-aware grouping strategies: (1) frequency-aware multi-parameter intra-row grouping and (2) $\ell_2$-norm-based saliency-driven column selection. For non-salient weights, a shared mean is employed across quantization groups within each frequency band to optimize storage efficiency. Experiments conducted on the OPT and LLaMA models demonstrate that HBLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in $1$-bit quantization, attaining a perplexity of $6.71$ on LLaMA$2$-$13$B with an average weight storage of only $1.08$ bits.

*Samuel Kessler,Menglin Xia,Daniel Madrigal Diaz,Dongge Han,Helia Heshemi,Saravan Rajmohan,Victor Ruehle,Jordan T. Ash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the benefits of generating synthetic data iteratively during student language model finetuning, showing improved outcomes compared to static data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve student language model performance by investigating the effectiveness of iterative synthetic data generation over static generation methods.

Method: The authors proposed a closed-loop finetuning process where synthetic data is continuously generated in alignment with the student model's evolving state, using active learning-based selection criteria.

Result: Iterative synthetic data generation yields better student model performance compared to static generation while using a fixed computational or sample budget. Active learning-inspired selection methods outperform more complex alternatives.

Conclusion: Iteratively and actively generating training data tailored to the student model enhances its performance, demonstrating the advantages of dynamic over static synthetic data approaches.

Abstract: A common and effective means for improving language model capabilities involves finetuning a ``student'' language model's parameters on generations from a more proficient ``teacher'' model. Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant. We validate these claims across four mathematical and logical reasoning datasets using four different small language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks zero-shot foundation models on tabular data, examining their accuracy and hardware demands compared to traditional tree-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of thorough evaluation of the hardware efficiency of zero-shot foundation models applied to tabular data.

Method: Provides a benchmark to test accuracy, latency, CPU RAM, and GPU VRAM usage of foundation models and compares them to tuned tree-ensemble methods on NVIDIA T4 GPU.

Result: Tree models matched or surpassed foundation model accuracy in most cases while being significantly more hardware-efficient. Foundation models showed higher resource demands, notably longer latencies and higher memory consumption.

Conclusion: Current zero-shot foundation models sacrifice significant hardware efficiency for accuracy, underlining the need for future research to optimize their resource usage.

Abstract: Zero-shot foundation models (FMs) promise training-free prediction on tabular data, yet their hardware footprint remains poorly characterized. We present a fully reproducible benchmark that reports test accuracy together with wall-clock latency, peak CPU RAM, and peak GPU VRAM on four public datasets: Adult-Income, Higgs-100k, Wine-Quality, and California-Housing. Two open FMs (TabPFN-1.0 and TabICL-base) are compared against tuned XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest baselines on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU. The tree ensembles equal or surpass FM accuracy on three datasets while completing full-test batches in <= 0.40 s and <= 150 MB RAM, using zero VRAM. TabICL achieves a 0.8 percentage-point gain on Higgs but requires roughly 40,000 times more latency (960 s) and 9 GB VRAM. TabPFN matches tree-model accuracy on Wine and Housing but peaks at 4 GB VRAM and cannot process the full 100k-row Higgs table. These results quantify the substantial hardware-versus-accuracy trade-offs in current tabular FMs and provide an open baseline for future efficiency-oriented research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving accuracy and robustness in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) using their proposed framework, LESS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the oversight in prior approaches that ignore the significance of low-entropy segments in reasoning trajectories, which encode reusable and stable structural patterns crucial for model accuracy.

Method: The authors propose LESS, a framework that modulates low-entropy segments in reasoning trajectories by amplifying those unique to correct responses, suppressing those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizing shared segments. It is implemented on GRPO while preserving high-entropy exploration.

Result: LESS improves accuracy across six mathematical benchmarks, prevails over strong reinforcement learning baselines, and demonstrates better robustness in performance.

Conclusion: LESS optimizes RLVR by leveraging low-entropy segments, supporting both improved accuracy and a more robust performance floor in model reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. Recent work studies RLVR through token entropy, arguing that high-entropy tokens drive exploration and should receive stronger updates. However, they overlook the fact that most of a reasoning trajectory consists of low-entropy segments that encode stable and reusable structural patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that the overlap of low-entropy segments across correct responses strongly correlates with model accuracy, while overlaps involving incorrect responses exhibit stable but unproductive patterns. Motivated by these findings, we propose LESS, a correctness-aware reinforcement framework that performs fine-grained advantage modulation over low-entropy segments. LESS amplifies segments unique to correct responses, suppresses those unique to incorrect ones, and neutralizes segments shared by both, while preserving high-entropy exploration in the underlying RL algorithm. Instantiated on top of the popular GRPO, LESS consistently improves accuracy over strong RL baselines across three backbones and six math benchmarks, achieves stronger robustness of the performance floor.

*Junwoo Chang,Minwoo Park,Joohwan Seo,Roberto Horowitz,Jongmin Lee,Jongeun Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP) and proposes methods to handle RL environments where symmetries are partially broken, significantly improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL environments often exhibit partial symmetry-breaking, causing global errors in value estimation. There is a need for methods to effectively handle such environments while leveraging symmetry benefits.

Method: The authors propose PI-MDP, which uses selective Bellman backups based on local symmetry validity. They develop PE-DQN and PE-SAC algorithms for discrete and continuous control, incorporating this framework.

Result: Experiments across various benchmarks show that PE-DQN and PE-SAC outperform existing RL baselines, demonstrating improved generalizability and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Selective symmetry exploitation addresses challenges in symmetry-breaking and enhances RL performance, combining equivariance benefits with robustness.

Abstract: Group symmetries provide a powerful inductive bias for reinforcement learning (RL), enabling efficient generalization across symmetric states and actions via group-invariant Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, real-world environments almost never realize fully group-invariant MDPs; dynamics, actuation limits, and reward design usually break symmetries, often only locally. Under group-invariant Bellman backups for such cases, local symmetry-breaking introduces errors that propagate across the entire state-action space, resulting in global value estimation errors. To address this, we introduce Partially group-Invariant MDP (PI-MDP), which selectively applies group-invariant or standard Bellman backups depending on where symmetry holds. This framework mitigates error propagation from locally broken symmetries while maintaining the benefits of equivariance, thereby enhancing sample efficiency and generalizability. Building on this framework, we present practical RL algorithms -- Partially Equivariant (PE)-DQN for discrete control and PE-SAC for continuous control -- that combine the benefits of equivariance with robustness to symmetry-breaking. Experiments across Grid-World, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that PE-DQN and PE-SAC significantly outperform baselines, highlighting the importance of selective symmetry exploitation for robust and sample-efficient RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces D-CTNet, a model designed for multivariate time series forecasting in collaborative industrial settings, addressing challenges like inter-variable dependencies and non-stationary shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately forecast Multivariate Time Series (MTS) in industrial environments to enhance the collaborative design of systems, create Digital Twins, and ensure prompt maintenance despite challenges like inter-variable dependencies and environmental changes.

Method: D-CTNet uses a dual-branch design with a combination of linear temporal modeling and channel attention. It features a patch attention fusion module for long-range dependencies and a frequency-domain mechanism to handle distribution shifts.

Result: D-CTNet demonstrated superior forecasting accuracy and robustness on seven benchmark datasets when compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: D-CTNet is a promising tool for improving forecasting reliability in industrial collaborative systems, effectively addressing real-world challenges.

Abstract: Accurate Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for collaborative design of complex systems, Digital Twin building, and maintenance ahead of time. However, the collaborative industrial environment presents new challenges for MTS forecasting models: models should decouple complex inter-variable dependencies while addressing non-stationary distribution shift brought by environmental changes. To address these challenges and improve collaborative sensing reliability, we propose a Patch-Based Dual-Branch Channel-Temporal Forecasting Network (D-CTNet). Particularly, with a parallel dual-branch design incorporating linear temporal modeling layer and channel attention mechanism, our method explicitly decouples and jointly learns intra-channel temporal evolution patterns and dynamic multivariate correlations. Furthermore, a global patch attention fusion module goes beyond the local window scope to model long range dependencies. Most importantly, aiming at non-stationarity, a Frequency-Domain Stationarity Correction mechanism adaptively suppresses distribution shift impacts from environment change by spectrum alignment. Evaluations on seven benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better forecasting accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work shows great promise as a new forecasting engine for industrial collaborative systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIRA, a novel AI architecture inspired by the brain's associative memory, effectively addressing domain generalization and continual learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in AI learning by mimicking biological systems' seamless task-switching and memory retention abilities.

Method: Develop MIRA: a Hopfield-style associative memory integrated with a shared model backbone for sample-based task and domain adaptation.

Result: MIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution accuracy and surpasses catastrophic forgetting-focused methods in incremental learning.

Conclusion: MIRA combines biological inspiration with adapter-based modulation, showcasing potential for versatile, memory-augmented AI systems capable of task switching and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Organisms constantly pivot between tasks such as evading predators, foraging, traversing rugged terrain, and socializing, often within milliseconds. Remarkably, they preserve knowledge of once-learned environments sans catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon neuroscientists hypothesize, is due to a singular neural circuitry dynamically overlayed by neuromodulatory agents such as dopamine and acetylcholine. In parallel, deep learning research addresses analogous challenges via domain generalization (DG) and continual learning (CL), yet these methods remain siloed, despite the brains ability to perform them seamlessly. In particular, prior work has not explored architectures involving associative memories (AMs), which are an integral part of biological systems, to jointly address these tasks. We propose Memory-Integrated Reconfigurable Adapters (MIRA), a unified framework that integrates Hopfield-style associative memory modules atop a shared backbone. Associative memory keys are learned post-hoc to index and retrieve an affine combination of stored adapter updates for any given task or domain on a per-sample basis. By varying only the task-specific objectives, we demonstrate that MIRA seamlessly accommodates domain shifts and sequential task exposures under one roof. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our AM-augmented architecture significantly enhances adaptability and retention: in DG, MIRA achieves SoTA out-of-distribution accuracy, and in incremental learning settings, it outperforms architectures explicitly designed to handle catastrophic forgetting using generic CL algorithms. By unifying adapter-based modulation with biologically inspired associative memory, MIRA delivers rapid task switching and enduring knowledge retention in a single extensible architecture, charting a path toward more versatile and memory-augmented AI systems.

TL;DR: Researchers developed and tested a multi-modal AI framework for remote patient monitoring in cancer care, collecting 2.1 million data points and achieving 83.9% accuracy in adverse event prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in care for cancer patients between clinic visits and mitigate risks of unmonitored side effects by leveraging advanced technology.

Method: A multi-modal AI framework was designed and trialed using data from demographics, wearable sensors, daily surveys, and clinical events to predict adverse events, even with asynchronous and incomplete data.

Result: The AI model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70), and it highlighted prior treatments, patient wellness check-ins, and daily heart rate as critical predictive features.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the utility of multi-modal AI for remote cancer patient monitoring, offering a proactive, data-integrated approach to enhance patient care.

Abstract: For patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy, the time between clinic visits is full of uncertainties and risks of unmonitored side effects. To bridge this gap in care, we developed and prospectively trialed a multi-modal AI framework for remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system integrates multi-modal data from the HALO-X platform, such as demographics, wearable sensors, daily surveys, and clinical events. Our observational trial is one of the largest of its kind and has collected over 2.1 million data points (6,080 patient-days) of monitoring from 84 patients. We developed and adapted a multi-modal AI model to handle the asynchronous and incomplete nature of real-world RPM data, forecasting a continuous risk of future adverse events. The model achieved an accuracy of 83.9% (AUROC=0.70). Notably, the model identified previous treatments, wellness check-ins, and daily maximum heart rate as key predictive features. A case study demonstrated the model's ability to provide early warnings by outputting escalating risk profiles prior to the event. This work establishes the feasibility of multi-modal AI RPM for cancer care and offers a path toward more proactive patient support.(Accepted at Europe NeurIPS 2025 Multimodal Representation Learning for Healthcare Workshop)

### [527] [WUSH: Near-Optimal Adaptive Transforms for LLM Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00956)
*Jiale Chen,Vage Egiazarian,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimal adaptive linear transform (WUSH) for low-bitwidth quantization in large language models, addressing dynamic range issues caused by extreme weights and activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of common fixed orthogonal transforms like Hadamard matrices in quantization, which do not consider data statistics and dynamic range issues.

Method: The authors derive closed-form adaptive transforms for quantizing weights and activations, combining a data-dependent component (using second-order moments) with a Hadamard backbone for structured implementation.

Result: Their proposed WUSH method consistently outperforms traditional Hadamard transformations in experimental evaluations across common numerical formats.

Conclusion: WUSH is a structured, adaptive, and provably optimal transformation that improves dynamic range management and quantization efficiency for language models under certain assumptions.

Abstract: Quantization to low bitwidth is a standard approach for deploying large language models, however, a few extreme weights and activations stretch the dynamic range and reduce the effective resolution of the quantizer. A common mitigation approach is to apply some fixed orthogonal transforms, such as Hadamard matrices, before quantization, which typically reduces the dynamic range. Yet, these transforms ignore the statistics of the data, and their optimality is currently not understood. In this work, we derive, for the first time, closed-form optimal linear blockwise transforms for joint weight-activation quantization using standard data-free quantizers for common numerical formats. Specifically, we provide derivations of the optimal adaptive (data-aware) transforms for round-to-nearest (RTN), AbsMax-scaled block quantizers for both integer and floating-point formats. The resulting construction, which we call WUSH, combines a Hadamard backbone with a data-dependent component based on second-order moments, yielding a non-orthogonal transform that is provably optimal under mild assumptions and remains structured for efficient implementation. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach consistently improves upon the Hadamard transform for common formats.

*Qi Wang,Mian Wu,Yuyang Zhang,Mingqi Yuan,Wenyao Zhang,Haoxiang You,Yunbo Wang,Xin Jin,Xiaokang Yang,Wenjun Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes leveraging pretrained video diffusion models to provide reward signals for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, avoiding the need for designing specific reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing programmatic reward functions for RL is challenging and lacks generalizability to different tasks, necessitating a more adaptable solution.

Method: The approach involves using pretrained video diffusion models for video-level and frame-level rewards. Video-level rewards are derived by fine-tuning video diffusion models to align agent trajectories with goal videos. Frame-level rewards are created by identifying goal states using CLIP and leveraging a forward-backward representation.

Result: Experiments on Meta-World tasks showed the proposed method effectively enabled goal-driven RL without relying on ad-hoc reward designs.

Conclusion: Pretrained video diffusion models can serve as informative and generalizable reward mechanisms, improving the adaptability and efficiency of RL agents in achieving diverse goals.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet it often relies on carefully designed programmatic reward functions to guide agent behavior. Designing such reward functions can be challenging and may not generalize well across different tasks. To address this limitation, we leverage the rich world knowledge contained in pretrained video diffusion models to provide goal-driven reward signals for RL agents without ad-hoc design of reward. Our key idea is to exploit off-the-shelf video diffusion models pretrained on large-scale video datasets as informative reward functions in terms of video-level and frame-level goals. For video-level rewards, we first finetune a pretrained video diffusion model on domain-specific datasets and then employ its video encoder to evaluate the alignment between the latent representations of agent's trajectories and the generated goal videos. To enable more fine-grained goal-achievement, we derive a frame-level goal by identifying the most relevant frame from the generated video using CLIP, which serves as the goal state. We then employ a learned forward-backward representation that represents the probability of visiting the goal state from a given state-action pair as frame-level reward, promoting more coherent and goal-driven trajectories. Experiments on various Meta-World tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Cynthia Feeney,Shane Williams,Benjamin S. Wessler,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations in demographic reporting and subgroup validity in echocardiogram datasets for training deep learning models and emphasizes the need for improved data and analysis for underrepresented subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the equitable and accurate use of deep learning models in cardiac ultrasound interpretation, there is a need to address the underreporting of patient demographics and the lack of assessments for subgroup-specific performance.

Method: The authors analyzed six open echocardiogram datasets, improved sociodemographic reporting for TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO, and conducted subgroup analysis on aortic stenosis detection models to evaluate subgroup validity based on sex, race, and ethnicity.

Result: The study found insufficient demographic statistics for diverse patient groups in open datasets, uncovered no consideration of gender-diverse individuals, and identified a lack of subgroup validity for certain machine learning model predictions.

Conclusion: Subgroup validity concerns in current echocardiogram datasets remain unresolved. Future work needs more data for underrepresented groups, better demographic reporting, and meticulous subgroup validity analysis before the clinical deployment of machine learning models.

Abstract: Echocardiogram datasets enable training deep learning models to automate interpretation of cardiac ultrasound, thereby expanding access to accurate readings of diagnostically-useful images. However, the gender, sex, race, and ethnicity of the patients in these datasets are underreported and subgroup-specific predictive performance is unevaluated. These reporting deficiencies raise concerns about subgroup validity that must be studied and addressed before model deployment. In this paper, we show that current open echocardiogram datasets are unable to assuage subgroup validity concerns. We improve sociodemographic reporting for two datasets: TMED-2 and MIMIC-IV-ECHO. Analysis of six open datasets reveals no consideration of gender-diverse patients and insufficient patient counts for many racial and ethnic groups. We further perform an exploratory subgroup analysis of two published aortic stenosis detection models on TMED-2. We find insufficient evidence for subgroup validity for sex, racial, and ethnic subgroups. Our findings highlight that more data for underrepresented subgroups, improved demographic reporting, and subgroup-focused analyses are needed to prove subgroup validity in future work.

*Zifeng Huang,Konstantin M. Zuev,Yong Xia,Michael Beer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the capacity and error bounds of neural oscillators combining second-order ODEs with MLPs for temporal sequence modeling, providing theoretical insights and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural oscillators perform well for stable learning of long-term causal relationships in sequences but lack theoretical quantification of capacity and error bounds.

Method: The study analyzes neural oscillators formed by second-order ODEs and MLPs, deriving upper approximation bounds and error scaling polynomially with MLP widths.

Result: Two numerical cases validate established approximation error bounds, confirming polynomial scaling and robustness of theoretical formulations.

Conclusion: The findings establish a theoretical basis for neural oscillator applications in temporal modeling, offering reliable performance and addressing parametric complexities.

Abstract: Neural oscillators, originating from the second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), have demonstrated competitive performance in stably learning causal mappings between long-term sequences or continuous temporal functions. However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering.

*Mohit Kumar,Mathias Brucker,Alexander Valentinitsch,Adnan Husakovic,Ali Abbas,Manuela Geiß,Bernhard A. Moser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework for federated learning, addressing heterogeneity, privacy, and communication limits using operator-theoretic methods, yielding gradient-free and privacy-preserving solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve federated learning amidst strict constraints of heterogeneity, computation, communication, and privacy while ensuring model performance.

Method: The framework maps solutions to RKHS via operators, approximates using data, and maps back, creating gradient-free algorithms. It proposes kernel-based machines leveraging space folding properties, with a privacy-preserving protocol using scalar measures and noise perturbation.

Result: The method achieves performance gains up to 23.7 points compared to gradient-based techniques across benchmarks. For high-privacy regimes, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy losses, and an FHE-compatible rule ensures practical implementation for encrypted predictions.

Conclusion: The framework combines proven mathematical guarantees with efficient communication and private knowledge sharing, offering a robust alternative to traditional federated learning methods with compatibility for encrypted environments.

Abstract: Federated learning must address heterogeneity, strict communication and computation limits, and privacy while ensuring performance. We propose an operator-theoretic framework that maps the $L^2$-optimal solution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) via a forward operator, approximates it using available data, and maps back with the inverse operator, yielding a gradient-free scheme. Finite-sample bounds are derived using concentration inequalities over operator norms, and the framework identifies a data-dependent hypothesis space with guarantees on risk, error, robustness, and approximation. Within this space we design efficient kernel machines leveraging the space folding property of Kernel Affine Hull Machines. Clients transfer knowledge via a scalar space folding measure, reducing communication and enabling a simple differentially private protocol: summaries are computed from noise-perturbed data matrices in one step, avoiding per-round clipping and privacy accounting. The induced global rule requires only integer minimum and equality-comparison operations per test point, making it compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Across four benchmarks, the gradient-free FL method with fixed encoder embeddings matches or outperforms strong gradient-based fine-tuning, with gains up to 23.7 points. In differentially private experiments, kernel smoothing mitigates accuracy loss in high-privacy regimes. The global rule admits an FHE realization using $Q \times C$ encrypted minimum and $C$ equality-comparison operations per test point, with operation-level benchmarks showing practical latencies. Overall, the framework provides provable guarantees with low communication, supports private knowledge transfer via scalar summaries, and yields an FHE-compatible prediction rule offering a mathematically grounded alternative to gradient-based federated learning under heterogeneity.

*Luigi Assom*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops an unsupervised method to analyze fruit-bats' vocalizations, revealing complexity in their communication influenced by behavioral contexts, especially in conflict scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the complexity of graded vocal systems, such as those of fruit bats, by exploring their discreteness, syntax, and temporal structures in relation to behavioral contexts.

Method: The research employs unsupervised labeling through manifold learning, compares it with acoustic similarity-based labels, encodes vocalizations as syllabic sequences, and evaluates syntax using Maximal Repetitions (MRs) and syllabic transition networks.

Result: The study identifies associative syntax in bat vocalizations, reveals context-dependent syllable use, and finds mechanisms encoding combinatorial complexity. Results also show variability in communication patterns between conflict and non-conflict contexts, with conflicts exhibiting higher vocal complexity.

Conclusion: This study highlights that communicative complexity in fruit bats increases in conflict settings, reflecting less compressible information in such scenarios. The findings provide deeper insights into graded vocal systems' structure and function.

Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 > 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value < 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent α < 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.

### [533] [AltNet: Addressing the Plasticity-Stability Dilemma in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01034)
*Mansi Maheshwari,John C. Raisbeck,Bruno Castro da Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AltNet, a reset-based method with twin networks to restore plasticity in neural networks, avoiding performance drops during resets, and improving reinforcement learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of plasticity loss in neural networks during reinforcement learning and find a safer way to restore plasticity without performance degradation, especially in critical real-world applications.

Method: AltNet leverages twin networks—one actively learns and acts while the other learns off-policy and from a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset, and the passive network becomes active, ensuring gradual learning without drops in performance.

Result: AltNet achieved improvements in sample efficiency and higher performance across several high-dimensional control tasks on the DeepMind Control Suite, outperforming baseline methods and other reset-based techniques.

Conclusion: AltNet effectively restores neural network plasticity while avoiding performance drops, making it a safer and more efficient approach for reinforcement learning in safety-critical settings.

Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable success in supervised learning when trained on a single task using a fixed dataset. However, when neural networks are trained on a reinforcement learning task, their ability to continue learning from new experiences declines over time. This decline in learning ability is known as plasticity loss. To restore plasticity, prior work has explored periodically resetting the parameters of the learning network, a strategy that often improves overall performance. However, such resets come at the cost of a temporary drop in performance, which can be dangerous in real-world settings. To overcome this instability, we introduce AltNet, a reset-based approach that restores plasticity without performance degradation by leveraging twin networks. The use of twin networks anchors performance during resets through a mechanism that allows networks to periodically alternate roles: one network learns as it acts in the environment, while the other learns off-policy from the active network's interactions and a replay buffer. At fixed intervals, the active network is reset and the passive network, having learned from prior experiences, becomes the new active network. AltNet restores plasticity, improving sample efficiency and achieving higher performance, while avoiding performance drops that pose risks in safety-critical settings. We demonstrate these advantages in several high-dimensional control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where AltNet outperforms various relevant baseline methods, as well as state-of-the-art reset-based techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by the lack of modularity and reproducibility in existing pipelines for time-series foundation models (TSFMs).

Method: FMTK provides standardized backbone and component abstractions for TSFM pipelines, ensuring modularity and flexibility with minimal code requirements.

Result: FMTK facilitates the construction of effective TSFM pipelines for diverse tasks, requiring as little as seven lines of code.

Conclusion: FMTK promotes modularity, flexibility, and ease of use for time-series foundation model applications, improving accessibility and reproducibility in the field.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have opened new avenues for machine learning applications due to their ability to adapt to new and unseen tasks with minimal or no further training. Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) -- FMs trained on time-series data -- have shown strong performance on classification, regression, and imputation tasks. Recent pipelines combine TSFMs with task-specific encoders, decoders, and adapters to improve performance; however, assembling such pipelines typically requires ad hoc, model-specific implementations that hinder modularity and reproducibility. We introduce FMTK, an open-source, lightweight and extensible toolkit for constructing and fine-tuning TSFM pipelines via standardized backbone and component abstractions. FMTK enables flexible composition across models and tasks, achieving correctness and performance with an average of seven lines of code. https://github.com/umassos/FMTK

*Chen Henry Wu,Sachin Goyal,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ModC, a framework to enhance reasoning diversity and scale efficiency during parallel sampling, addressing diversity collapse in model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallel sampling scales test-time efficiency but suffers from diversity collapse, limiting its performance. There's a need for methods to maintain diversity in outputs.

Method: The Mode-Conditioning (ModC) framework allocates test-time compute across reasoning modes via specialist models or mode-specific prefixes. Gradient clustering is also used to enable ModC without explicit mode labels.

Result: ModC improves scaling across tasks, achieves efficiency gains (4x on OpenThoughts with Qwen2.5-7B), enhances Pass@k, yields up to 10% gains in NuminaMath, and improves RL performance.

Conclusion: ModC unlocks the benefits of diversity in test-time scaling, addressing the shortcomings of standard training methods and improving efficiency, reasoning quality, and reinforcement learning outcomes.

Abstract: Parallel sampling promises substantial gains in test-time scaling, but its effectiveness is sharply limited by diversity collapse, where models concentrate on a few modes and repeated samples produce the same mistakes. We propose the mode-conditioning (ModC) framework, which explicitly allocates test-time compute across reasoning modes using either specialist models or mode-specific prefixes. ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k. We further show that gradient clustering enables ModC without explicit mode labels, yielding up to 10% gains on datasets such as NuminaMath. Finally, we show that ModC improves reinforcement learning (RL) and can further boost diversity-inducing RL methods. These results demonstrate that standard training underutilizes the diversity in data, and that ModC provides a simple, effective remedy for unlocking the full benefits of diversity in test-time scaling.

*MohammadParsa Dini,Human Jafari,Sajjad Amini,MohammadMahdi Mojahedian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive-lambda SISS is introduced to improve unlearning in generative models, dynamically adjusting unlearning strength across training with a new approach, outperforming static-lambda methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enforce the 'right to be forgotten' and prevent undesired content generation by large generative models without requiring expensive retraining.

Method: Adaptive-lambda SISS utilizes a dynamic latent variable (lambda) inferred at each training step through an inference network, conditioned on contextual features and optimized jointly with the diffusion model using a variational objective. Additional methods like score-based unlearning and hybrid objectives are proposed.

Result: Adaptive-lambda SISS achieves superior unlearning of forgotten classes while retaining high-quality generation for retained classes, confirmed through experiments on an augmented MNIST benchmark.

Conclusion: Adaptive-lambda SISS provides a more effective and efficient mechanism for machine unlearning in generative models compared to fixed-lambda methods, improving both unlearning performance and generation quality preservation.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning is essential for large generative models (VAEs, DDPMs) to comply with the right to be forgotten and prevent undesired content generation without costly retraining. Existing approaches, such as Static-lambda SISS for diffusion models, rely on a fixed mixing weight lambda, which is suboptimal because the required unlearning strength varies across samples and training stages.
  We propose Adaptive-lambda SISS, a principled extension that turns lambda into a latent variable dynamically inferred at each training step. A lightweight inference network parameterizes an adaptive posterior over lambda, conditioned on contextual features derived from the instantaneous SISS loss terms (retain/forget losses and their gradients). This enables joint optimization of the diffusion model and the lambda-inference mechanism via a variational objective, yielding significantly better trade-offs.
  We further extend the adaptive-lambda principle to score-based unlearning and introduce a multi-class variant of Score Forgetting Distillation. In addition, we present two new directions: (i) a hybrid objective combining the data-free efficiency of Score Forgetting Distillation with the direct gradient control of SISS, and (ii) a Reinforcement Learning formulation that treats unlearning as a sequential decision process, learning an optimal policy over a state space defined by the model's current memory of the forget set.
  Experiments on an augmented MNIST benchmark show that Adaptive-lambda SISS substantially outperforms the original static-lambda SISS, achieving stronger removal of forgotten classes while better preserving generation quality on the retain set.

*Alper Yıldırım,İbrahim Yücedağ*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in Transformer models, proposing PRISM as a replacement for enhanced plasticity and stability during adaptation to new concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from optimization inefficiencies and rigidity, leading to challenges in adapting to novel concepts during usage.

Method: A diagnostic protocol, Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), highlights barriers in learning alignment. PRISM, based on harmonic representations, replaces conventional self-attention mechanisms.

Result: PRISM outperforms Standard Transformers in plasticity-stability tests, minimizing degradation (-0.84 BLEU) compared to the Transformers (-10.55 BLEU).

Conclusion: PRISM offers superior capability for real-time knowledge adaptation by decoupling memory and reasoning, addressing shortcomings in traditional Transformer models.

Abstract: Standard Transformers suffer from a "Semantic Alignment Tax", a prohibitive optimization cost required to organize a chaotic initialization into a coherent geometric map via local gradient diffusion. We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates "Catastrophic Rigidity", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the "Plasticity-Stability" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU). These results suggest that harmonic representations effectively decouple memory from reasoning, offering a structural solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma in real-time knowledge adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current precipitation nowcasting methods are computationally heavy and inaccessible for many countries, creating a need for more efficient and accurate forecasting methods.

Method: The authors propose a dual neural operator model (PIANO) that incorporates the physics of advection-diffusion and utilizes a generative model to convert satellite images into radar images for precipitation forecasting.

Result: The method showed significant improvements in predicting moderate and heavy precipitation events, with low seasonal variability and robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed PIANO model demonstrates the potential of physics-informed models for accurate and accessible precipitation nowcasting, providing a strong baseline for future work.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, key for early warning of disasters, currently relies on computationally expensive and restrictive methods that limit access to many countries. To overcome this challenge, we propose precipitation nowcasting using satellite imagery with physics constraints for improved accuracy and physical consistency. We use a novel physics-informed dual neural operator (PIANO) structure to enforce the fundamental equation of advection-diffusion during training to predict satellite imagery using a PINN loss. Then, we use a generative model to convert satellite images to radar images, which are used for precipitation nowcasting. Compared to baseline models, our proposed model shows a notable improvement in moderate (4mm/h) precipitation event prediction alongside short-term heavy (8mm/h) precipitation event prediction. It also demonstrates low seasonal variability in predictions, indicating robustness for generalization. This study suggests the potential of the PIANO and serves as a good baseline for physics-informed precipitation nowcasting.

*Suzan Ece Ada,Georg Martius,Emre Ugur,Erhan Oztop*

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL) framework to improve offline RL in non-stationary environments, where traditional methods deteriorate due to unexpected changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL methods often fail in real-world situations with abrupt and time-varying changes, leading to performance degradation.

Method: The paper proposes the FORL framework, integrating conditional diffusion-based state generation with zero-shot time-series foundation models to address non-stationarity and partial observability.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that FORL achieves superior performance compared to current baselines under realistic non-stationary environment conditions.

Conclusion: FORL effectively bridges offline RL with real-world complexities, addressing non-stationary challenges and improving agent robustness.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.

*Dongyue Li,Zhenshuo Zhang,Minxuan Duan,Edgar Dobriban,Hongyang R. Zhang*

TL;DR: This paper introduces branching neural networks (AutoBRANE) for multitask algorithmic reasoning, achieving significant performance, runtime, and memory improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a unified neural model capable of efficiently handling and excelling in multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks without negative interference.

Method: AutoBRANE optimizes a branching architecture by clustering tasks using gradient-based affinity scores, enabling efficient task partitioning and structure learning.

Result: AutoBRANE demonstrates superior performance across graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks, with improved accuracy, reduced runtime, and memory usage.

Conclusion: Branching neural networks provide an effective and efficient solution to multitask algorithmic reasoning, offering structured, scalable, and interpretable task learning.

Abstract: Algorithmic reasoning -- the ability to perform step-by-step logical inference -- has become a core benchmark for evaluating reasoning in graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). Ideally, one would like to design a single model capable of performing well on multiple algorithmic reasoning tasks simultaneously. However, this is challenging when the execution steps of algorithms differ from one another, causing negative interference when they are trained together.
  We propose branching neural networks, a principled architecture for multitask algorithmic reasoning. Searching for the optimal $k$-ary tree with $L$ layers over $n$ algorithmic tasks is combinatorial, requiring exploration of up to $k^{nL}$ possible structures. We develop AutoBRANE, an efficient algorithm that reduces this search to $O(nL)$ time by solving a convex relaxation at each layer to approximate an optimal task partition. The method clusters tasks using gradient-based affinity scores and can be used on top of any base model, including GNNs and LLMs.
  We validate AutoBRANE on a broad suite of graph-algorithmic and text-based reasoning benchmarks. We show that gradient features estimate true task performance within 5% error across four GNNs and four LLMs (up to 34B parameters). On the CLRS benchmark, it outperforms the strongest single multitask GNN by 3.7% and the best baseline by 1.2%, while reducing runtime by 48% and memory usage by 26%. The learned branching structures reveal an intuitively reasonable hierarchical clustering of related algorithms. On three text-based graph reasoning benchmarks, AutoBRANE improves over the best non-branching multitask baseline by 3.2%. Finally, on a large graph dataset with 21M edges and 500 tasks, AutoBRANE achieves a 28% accuracy gain over existing multitask and branching architectures, along with a 4.5$\times$ reduction in runtime.

### [541] [World Model Robustness via Surprise Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01119)
*Geigh Zollicoffer,Tanush Chopra,Mingkuan Yan,Xiaoxu Ma,Kenneth Eaton,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an algorithm that uses a world model's measure of surprise to counteract the effects of noise and ensure robust reinforcement learning under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI deployed in real-world contexts often encounters unexpected noise or OOD distractions that can destabilize policies and create safety issues. Robust training is limited in preempting every possible noise, necessitating methods to handle unanticipated OOD conditions.

Method: The authors introduce rejection sampling techniques (multi-representation and single-representation) to mitigate the effects of noisy data, enabling robustness in settings with faulty sensors. These techniques utilize the 'surprise' information from world models.

Result: The techniques demonstrated preserved performance under various noise levels across simulation environments (CARLA, Safety Gymnasium). Additionally, they improved the stability of state-of-the-art world models (Cosmos, DreamerV3) regardless of architectural differences.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide robust and reliable performance for world model-based reinforcement learning agents under noisy and OOD conditions, emphasizing their adaptability across diverse environments and models.

Abstract: AI systems deployed in the real world must contend with distractions and out-of-distribution (OOD) noise that can destabilize their policies and lead to unsafe behavior. While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3. Together, these results highlight the robustness of our approach across world modeling domains. We release our code at https://github.com/Bluefin-Tuna/WISER .

*Hamza ElMokhtar Shili,Natasha Patnaik,Isabelle Ruble,Kathryn Jarjoura,Daniel Suarez Aguirre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores algorithmic variants of the Frank-Wolfe method for pruning Convolutional Neural Networks, particularly emphasizing FW with momentum for improved sparsity and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, this paper aims to identify efficient sub-networks within larger pre-trained CNNs that perform well for image classification tasks.

Method: The methodology involves comparing magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and a FW method with momentum across varying dense pre-training budgets.

Result: Experimental results show that FW with momentum yields pruned CNNs that are sparser, more accurate, and require less pre-training while maintaining minimal inference-time overhead.

Conclusion: FW with momentum offers a promising approach to prune CNNs effectively, enabling faster and more accurate models with reduced pre-training requirements.

Abstract: We investigate algorithmic variants of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization method for pruning convolutional neural networks. This is motivated by the "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis", which suggests the existence of smaller sub-networks within larger pre-trained networks that perform comparatively well (if not better). Whilst most literature in this area focuses on Deep Neural Networks more generally, we specifically consider Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. Building on the hypothesis, we compare simple magnitude-based pruning, a Frank-Wolfe style pruning scheme, and an FW method with momentum on a CNN trained on MNIST. Our experiments track test accuracy, loss, sparsity, and inference time as we vary the dense pre-training budget from 1 to 10 epochs. We find that FW with momentum yields pruned networks that are both sparser and more accurate than the original dense model and the simple pruning baselines, while incurring minimal inference-time overhead in our implementation. Moreover, FW with momentum reaches these accuracies after only a few epochs of pre-training, indicating that full pre-training of the dense model is not required in this setting.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new RL formulation for optimizing sequence-level rewards in language models via surrogate token-level objectives, emphasizing techniques for stability such as importance sampling and Routing Replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in reinforcement learning stability, particularly optimizing sequence-level rewards in large language models while ensuring training stability and convergence.

Method: Using a first-order approximation, the paper identifies conditions for surrogate objectives to optimize sequence-level rewards and tests stabilization techniques like importance sampling, clipping, and Routing Replay during RL training with a large-scale 30B MoE model.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that policy gradient methods with importance sampling enhance on-policy training stability. For off-policy updates, combining clipping and Routing Replay mitigates instability issues from policy staleness, achieving stable convergence.

Conclusion: This study presents insights and effective stabilization techniques for RL in large language models, emphasizing that stable training methods yield consistent, high-quality results, facilitating future advancements in RL research.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.

*Konstantin Makarychev,Ilias Papanikolaou,Liren Shan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for explainable k-medians clustering under the lp norm for any finite p >= 1, improving or matching pre-existing bounds, and presenting a dynamic version suitable for evolving data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the interpretability of k-medians clustering by using explainable decision trees and expanding applicability to all lp norms, improving over prior limited algorithms.

Method: Develop an algorithm for k-medians clustering explainable through threshold decision trees under lp norms for p >= 1, with dynamic capabilities for insertion and deletion updates.

Result: The algorithm achieves an approximation to the k-medians cost under lp norms (p >= 1), improving prior bounds for p=2, matching bounds for p=1 (up to minor multiplicative factors), and supporting dynamic updates with efficient time complexity.

Conclusion: The introduced algorithm provides a robust and interpretable solution for k-medians clustering under various norms, offering improvements in static and dynamic data scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of explainable k-medians clustering introduced by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and Rashtchian (2020). In this problem, the goal is to construct a threshold decision tree that partitions data into k clusters while minimizing the k-medians objective. These trees are interpretable because each internal node makes a simple decision by thresholding a single feature, allowing users to trace and understand how each point is assigned to a cluster. We present the first algorithm for explainable k-medians under lp norm for every finite p >= 1. Our algorithm achieves an O(p(log k)^{1 + 1/p - 1/p^2}) approximation to the optimal k-medians cost for any p >= 1. Previously, algorithms were known only for p = 1 and p = 2. For p = 2, our algorithm improves upon the existing bound of O(log^{3/2}k), and for p = 1, it matches the tight bound of log k + O(1) up to a multiplicative O(log log k) factor. We show how to implement our algorithm in a dynamic setting. The dynamic algorithm maintains an explainable clustering under a sequence of insertions and deletions, with amortized update time O(d log^3 k) and O(log k) recourse, making it suitable for large-scale and evolving datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FiberNet integrates differential geometry with machine learning for interpretable classification, providing a novel approach with geometric optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability and efficiency typically missing in conventional deep learning frameworks.

Method: Introduces Fiber Bundle Networks (FiberNet), using learnable Riemannian metrics and variational prototype optimization, transforming classification into geometric optimization.

Result: Achieves interpretable and efficient classification by defining prototypes as decision regions through Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric.

Conclusion: The combination of fiber bundles and machine learning offers a framework that reconciles interpretability with efficiency, setting it apart from standard deep learning methodologies.

Abstract: We propose Fiber Bundle Networks (FiberNet), a novel machine learning framework integrating differential geometry with machine learning. Unlike traditional deep neural networks relying on black-box function fitting, we reformulate classification as interpretable geometric optimization on fiber bundles, where categories form the base space and wavelet-transformed features lie in the fibers above each category. We introduce two innovations: (1) learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components, (2) variational prototype optimization through energy function minimization. Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability. This work demonstrates that the integration of fiber bundle with machine learning provides interpretability and efficiency, which are difficult to obtain simultaneously in conventional deep learning.

### [546] [ZIP-RC: Zero-overhead Inference-time Prediction of Reward and Cost for Adaptive and Interpretable Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01457)
*Rohin Manvi,Joey Hong,Tim Seyde,Maxime Labonne,Mathias Lechner,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces ZIP-RC, a method that improves adaptive inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) by allowing them to predict reward and cost in real-time without additional overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack the ability to introspect and adapt to their performance during reasoning tasks, leading to inefficient inference and untrustworthy confidence signals.

Method: ZIP-RC utilizes reserved or unused logits during the same forward pass as token prediction to output a joint distribution of final reward and remaining length. This allows computing sampling utility in real-time and enables decisions on token continuation or sampling initiation.

Result: ZIP-RC achieves up to 12% improved accuracy over majority voting in mixed-difficulty benchmarks while maintaining or lowering the average cost, offering smooth performance trade-offs between accuracy, compute, and latency.

Conclusion: ZIP-RC provides efficient real-time introspection for LLMs, improving reasoning quality, cost-efficiency, and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.

*Shravan Chaudhari,Yoav Wald,Suchi Saria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, \ours{}, for addressing open-set recognition even during background distribution shifts, showcasing its theoretical and empirical superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of maintaining machine learning model performance under data shifts, especially when new classes emerge or distribution of known categories changes.

Method: The paper proposes \ours{}, a robust method grounded on the separability of novel classes from non-novel ones, with theoretical guarantees and system-wide optimizations for scalability and reliability.

Result: \ours{} outperformed existing open-set recognition methods in both image and text datasets under background distribution shifts, also uncovering how size of novel classes affects performance.

Conclusion: The proposed \ours{} method provides a reliable solution for open-set recognition amidst shifting distributions, offering significant advancements over current approaches in theory and practice.

Abstract: As we deploy machine learning systems in the real world, a core challenge is to maintain a model that is performant even as the data shifts. Such shifts can take many forms: new classes may emerge that were absent during training, a problem known as open-set recognition, and the distribution of known categories may change. Guarantees on open-set recognition are mostly derived under the assumption that the distribution of known classes, which we call \emph{the background distribution}, is fixed. In this paper we develop \ours{}, a method that is guaranteed to solve open-set recognition even in the challenging case where the background distribution shifts. We prove that the method works under benign assumptions that the novel class is separable from the non-novel classes, and provide theoretical guarantees that it outperforms a representative baseline in a simplified overparameterized setting. We develop techniques to make \ours{} scalable and robust, and perform comprehensive empirical evaluations on image and text data. The results show that \ours{} significantly outperforms existing open-set recognition methods under background shift. Moreover, we provide new insights into how factors such as the size of the novel class influences performance, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in prior work.

*Ahmad Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel machine learning method using a multi-class classification framework for predicting molecular energies and forces, achieving comparable accuracy to standard regression methods while also quantifying model uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) approximate DFT energies and forces but lack a robust method to quantify model uncertainty, which limits interpretability and trust in predictions.

Method: The approach reformulates energy/force prediction into a multi-class classification problem. It predicts a histogram of energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets to histograms, and trains using cross-entropy loss.

Result: The proposed method achieves error performance comparable to scalar regression techniques, while enabling quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of predicted energy/force distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-class classification method is effective and provides richer information, delivering both accurate molecular energy/force predictions and a principled confidence measure through uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a widely used computational method for estimating the energy and behavior of molecules. Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are models trained to approximate DFT-level energies and forces at dramatically lower computational cost. Many modern MLIPs rely on a scalar regression formulation; given information about a molecule, they predict a single energy value and corresponding forces while minimizing absolute error with DFT's calculations. In this work, we explore a multi-class classification formulation that predicts a categorical distribution over energy/force values, providing richer supervision through multiple targets. Most importantly, this approach offers a principled way to quantify model uncertainty.
  In particular, our method predicts a histogram of the energy/force distribution, converts scalar targets into histograms, and trains the model using cross-entropy loss. Our results demonstrate that this categorical formulation can achieve absolute error performance comparable to regression baselines. Furthermore, this representation enables the quantification of epistemic uncertainty through the entropy of the predicted distribution, offering a measure of model confidence absent in scalar regression approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'ThermAl,' a physics-informed generative AI framework designed for rapid and accurate thermal analysis in integrated circuits, outperforming traditional FEM-based methods in both speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities causing temperature spikes and reliability concerns, which traditional FEM methods struggle with due to computational inefficiency in early design stages.

Method: The method involves a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to predict transient and steady-state thermal distributions from input activity profiles.

Result: ThermAl demonstrates high accuracy with a RMSE of 0.71°C and runs up to ~200 times faster than FEM tools, maintaining reliability even under extended temperature ranges and diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: ThermAl successfully enables early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning, proving its utility in large-scale EDA workflows and addressing critical thermal reliability challenges in IC design.

Abstract: Thermal analysis is increasingly critical in modern integrated circuits, where non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities can cause rapid temperature spikes and reliability concerns. Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85°C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55°C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95°C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HalluGraph, a framework to detect hallucinations in legal AI systems by using graph-theoretic methods to ensure generated legal texts accurately represent source documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal AI systems often fail to provide verifiable guarantees of accuracy, leading to critical risks when citing legal texts. Current methods using semantic similarity metrics are insufficient, especially in high-stakes scenarios where confusions can have severe consequences.

Method: HalluGraph utilizes graph-theoretic approaches to compare extracted knowledge graphs, decomposing metrics into Entity Grounding (EG) and Relation Preservation (RP) to ensure accurate representation and alignment of generated text with source documents.

Result: HalluGraph demonstrated near-perfect detection accuracy on structured control documents (AUC = 0.979) and robust performance on more challenging generative legal tasks (AUC ≈ 0.89), outperforming semantic similarity baselines.

Conclusion: HalluGraph provides interpretable, reliable metrics and enables traceability, offering a significant advancement for ensuring accountability and accuracy in legal AI systems for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Legal AI systems powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face a critical accountability challenge: when an AI assistant cites case law, statutes, or contractual clauses, practitioners need verifiable guarantees that generated text faithfully represents source documents. Existing hallucination detectors rely on semantic similarity metrics that tolerate entity substitutions, a dangerous failure mode when confusing parties, dates, or legal provisions can have material consequences. We introduce HalluGraph, a graph-theoretic framework that quantifies hallucinations through structural alignment between knowledge graphs extracted from context, query, and response. Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($>$400 words, $>$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages.

Motivation: The study aims to design an energy-efficient, adaptive LED lighting control system feasible for resource-limited environments, particularly for applications like agriculture.

Method: The method involves implementing a model-free Q-learning algorithm to control LED brightness, utilizing an LDR sensor for real-time feedback, and conducting 130 trials to evaluate performance metrics like convergence speed and efficiency.

Result: The RL agent successfully stabilized light intensity across targets with minimal overshooting, smooth convergence, and resistance to environmental disturbances.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that lightweight, on-device RL can be effectively used for adaptive lighting control, paving the way for broader environmental control applications in constrained systems.

Abstract: This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control strategy for adaptive lighting regulation in controlled environments using a low-power microcontroller. A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents DA-SHRED, a machine learning framework that integrates real-world sensor data with simulation models to address gaps and inaccuracies in complex system modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern sensing demands data efficiency, real-time processing, and accurate integration of sparse sensor data with simulation models, addressing the limitations of oversimplified models.

Method: The method involves DA-SHRED, a framework using a shallow recurrent decoder coupled with latent space learning and sparse nonlinear dynamics identification to fuse simulated and real sensor data.

Result: DA-SHRED accurately bridges the SIM2REAL gap and recovers hidden or missing dynamics in highly complex physical systems.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable data assimilation by combining temporal encoding and physics-informed corrections, significantly improving the modeling of spatiotemporal fields.

Abstract: The requirements of modern sensing are rapidly evolving, driven by increasing demands for data efficiency, real-time processing, and deployment under limited sensing coverage. Complex physical systems are often characterized through the integration of a limited number of point sensors in combination with scientific computations which approximate the dominant, full-state dynamics. Simulation models, however, inevitably neglect small-scale or hidden processes, are sensitive to perturbations, or oversimplify parameter correlations, leading to reconstructions that often diverge from the reality measured by sensors. This creates a critical need for data assimilation, the process of integrating observational data with predictive simulation models to produce coherent and accurate estimates of the full state of complex physical systems. We propose a machine learning framework for Data Assimilation with a SHallow REcurrent Decoder (DA-SHRED) which bridges the simulation-to-real (SIM2REAL) gap between computational modeling and experimental sensor data. For real-world physics systems modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields, where the full state cannot be directly observed and must be inferred from sparse sensor measurements, we leverage the latent space learned from a reduced simulation model via SHRED, and update these latent variables using real sensor data to accurately reconstruct the full system state. Furthermore, our algorithm incorporates a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics based regression model in the latent space to identify functionals corresponding to missing dynamics in the simulation model. We demonstrate that DA-SHRED successfully closes the SIM2REAL gap and additionally recovers missing dynamics in highly complex systems, demonstrating that the combination of efficient temporal encoding and physics-informed correction enables robust data assimilation.

Motivation: The deployment of geospatial foundation models (GeoFM) for Earth observation tasks is limited by their large size and resource demands, which poses challenges for onboard execution in space environments.

Method: Compact versions of Vision Transformer-based GeoFMs were developed, integrating model compression and domain adaptation techniques to enable efficient onboard execution.

Result: Compact GeoFMs achieved high performance across five downstream tasks and demonstrated reliable inference aboard the ISS, verifying their resource-efficient design.

Conclusion: Compact GeoFMs offer a promising solution for deploying powerful yet resource-friendly models for Earth observation missions, enabling advanced AI applications in space hardware.

Abstract: Geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs) promise broad generalisation capacity for Earth observation (EO) tasks, particularly under data-limited conditions. However, their large size poses a barrier to deployment on resource-constrained space hardware. To address this, we present compact variants of a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based GeoFM that preserve downstream task performance while enabling onboard execution. Evaluation across five downstream tasks and validation in two representative flight environments show that model compression and domain adaptation are critical to reducing size and resource demands while maintaining high performance under operational conditions. We further demonstrate reliable on-orbit inference with the IMAGIN-e payload aboard the International Space Station. These results establish a pathway from large GeoFMs to flight-ready, resource-efficient deployments, expanding the feasibility of onboard AI for EO missions.

TL;DR: The paper presents INSPO, a novel framework that dynamically optimizes instructions in the reinforcement learning loop for more effective multi-turn reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static, manually designed instructions used in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) are suboptimal and do not adapt to evolving agent policies, limiting reasoning performance.

Method: The proposed INSPO framework integrates instruction optimization into the RL loop by maintaining a population of instructions, using RL-attributed rewards to prune ineffective instructions, and evolving new ones via an LLM-based reflection mechanism.

Result: INSPO significantly outperforms baselines with static instructions in multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, achieving better results with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: INSPO dynamically discovers and optimizes instructions, enabling agents to achieve strategy-driven reasoning improvements and better performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.

### [555] [Teaching by Failure: Counter-Example-Driven Curricula for Transformer Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01187)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC), a framework designed to improve the robustness of Transformer models by iteratively targeting their failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models struggle with extrapolation, failing on inputs longer or more complex than those used during training. This limitation motivated the development of a framework to address these issues and enhance generalization.

Method: The CEDC framework uses the model's own failures to improve its learning. It identifies incorrect predictions via a verifier, generates datasets enriched with the identified failures, and fine-tunes the model iteratively on these error-focused datasets.

Result: CEDC achieves up to 30x greater length extrapolation compared to baselines, is 3.75x more efficient than uniform data augmentation, and works without manual difficulty heuristics. Evaluations span algorithmic and natural language tasks.

Conclusion: Verifier-guided, failure-driven learning offers a streamlined and effective way to enhance the generalization capabilities of Transformer models, overcoming brittle extrapolation issues.

Abstract: Transformer models often exhibit brittle extrapolation, failing on inputs that are longer or structurally more complex than those seen during training. We introduce Counter-Example-Driven Curricula (CEDC), an automated framework that improves model robustness by iteratively focusing on its own failures. At each step, CEDC uses the current model to generate a diverse set of candidate problems, employs a fast, executable verifier to identify incorrect predictions (counter-examples), and then fine-tunes the model on a dataset enriched with these discovered failures. We evaluate CEDC on a suite of algorithmic and natural language tasks, including integer addition, sorting, Dyck-2 language recognition, and three text classification benchmarks. Compared to static training and standard curriculum learning baselines, CEDC achieves up to 30x greater length extrapolation, is 3.75x more computationally efficient than uniform data augmentation, and requires no manual difficulty heuristics. We provide a detailed analysis of the counter-examples, showing how the curriculum naturally adapts to target progressively more complex error modes. Our findings establish verifier-guided, failure-driven learning as a simple, powerful, and efficient paradigm for enhancing the generalization capabilities of Transformer models.

### [556] [LGDC: Latent Graph Diffusion via Spectrum-Preserving Coarsening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01190)
*Nagham Osman,Keyue Jiang,Davide Buffelli,Xiaowen Dong,Laura Toni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes two graph generation paradigms—autoregressive and one-shot models—highlighting respective local and global modeling strengths. It introduces LGDC, a hybrid framework combining both approaches, showing efficiency and balanced structural accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph generation is pivotal in various scientific fields, but existing methods struggle to capture both fine-grained local features and global patterns effectively.

Method: The authors introduce LGDC, which combines spectrum-preserving coarsening for latent representation, diffusion generation for efficiency, and decoarsening to restore graph detail, leveraging benefits from both paradigms.

Result: Experiments show LGDC performs comparably to autoregressive models for local structures and diffusion models for global patterns, validating its hybrid approach.

Conclusion: LGDC offers a unified graph generation framework that efficiently balances the modeling of both local and global graph properties, outperforming individual paradigms.

Abstract: Graph generation is a critical task across scientific domains. Existing methods fall broadly into two categories: autoregressive models, which iteratively expand graphs, and one-shot models, such as diffusion, which generate the full graph at once. In this work, we provide an analysis of these two paradigms and reveal a key trade-off: autoregressive models stand out in capturing fine-grained local structures, such as degree and clustering properties, whereas one-shot models excel at modeling global patterns, such as spectral distributions. Building on this, we propose LGDC (latent graph diffusion via spectrum-preserving coarsening), a hybrid framework that combines strengths of both approaches. LGDC employs a spectrum-preserving coarsening-decoarsening to bidirectionally map between graphs and a latent space, where diffusion efficiently generates latent graphs before expansion restores detail. This design captures both local and global properties with improved efficiency. Empirically, LGDC matches autoregressive models on locally structured datasets (Tree) and diffusion models on globally structured ones (Planar, Community-20), validating the benefits of hybrid generation.

### [557] [Learning to Reconstruct Temperature Field from Sparse Observations with Implicit Physics Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01196)
*Shihang Li,Zhiqiang Gong,Weien Zhou,Yue Gao,Wen Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPTR, a new method for reconstructing temperature fields of heat-source systems, leveraging simulation data as priors to improve accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for temperature field reconstruction face challenges due to high data acquisition costs and variability across conditions. There is a need for models with stronger generalization capabilities that better utilize simulation data.

Method: The proposed IPTR framework uses reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. It incorporates a dual physics embedding module with two branches: one for leveraging reference data with cross-attention and another for encoding spatial features with Fourier layers.

Result: IPTR outperforms existing methods in reconstruction accuracy and generalization across various conditions including single-condition, multi-condition, and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: By integrating implicit physics guidance and leveraging simulation priors, IPTR enhances reconstruction accuracy and adaptability, offering a significant improvement over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of temperature field of heat-source systems (TFR-HSS) is crucial for thermal monitoring and reliability assessment in engineering applications such as electronic devices and aerospace structures. However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field. Extensive experiments under single-condition, multi-condition, and few-shot settings demonstrate that IPTR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and strong generalization capability.

*Minglai Yang,Xinyu Guo,Mihai Surdeanu,Liangming Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlignSAE improves interpretability of LLMs by aligning Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features with human-defined concepts, enhancing control and inspection of specific relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of the difficulty in inspecting or controlling factual knowledge encoded in the hidden spaces of Large Language Models (LLMs), and to improve Sparse Autoencoders which often produce entangled feature representations.

Method: AlignSAE uses a "pre-train, then post-train" curriculum, including an unsupervised phase followed by supervised post-training to align SAE features with a defined ontology, isolating specific concepts into dedicated latent spaces.

Result: AlignSAE demonstrated empirical success in enabling precise causal interventions like reliable 'concept swaps,' targeting semantically aligned feature slots, and improving interpretability.

Conclusion: AlignSAE offers a significant step forward in making LLMs' internal representations more interpretable and controllable by aligning features with human-defined concepts, facilitating precise manipulations and understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode factual knowledge within hidden parametric spaces that are difficult to inspect or control. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a "pre-train, then post-train" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable "concept swaps", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots.

Result: Simulation results show that the CA-DDPG algorithm effectively enhances system capacity and outperforms other optimization methods regarding sum rate improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed CA-DDPG algorithm demonstrates the potential to enhance spectrum efficiency in STAR-RIS-UAV systems through better environmental interaction and higher system performance.

Abstract: With the rapid advances in programmable materials, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have become a pivotal technology for future wireless communications. The simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can both transmit and reflect signals, enabling comprehensive signal control and expanding application scenarios. This paper introduces an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to further enhance system flexibility and proposes an optimization design for the spectrum efficiency of the STAR-RIS-UAV-assisted wireless communication system. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm capable of iteratively optimizing beamforming, phase shifts, and UAV positioning to maximize the system's sum rate through continuous interactions with the environment. To improve exploration in deterministic policies, we introduce a stochastic perturbation factor, which enhances exploration capabilities. As exploration is strengthened, the algorithm's ability to accurately evaluate the state-action value function becomes critical. Thus, based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose a convolution-augmented deep deterministic policy gradient (CA-DDPG) algorithm that balances exploration and evaluation to improve the system's sum rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the CA-DDPG algorithm effectively interacts with the environment, optimizing the beamforming matrix, phase shift matrix, and UAV location, thereby improving system capacity and achieving better performance than other algorithms.

*Xuezhi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method to solve the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem using neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow instead of traditional or supervised learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OPF methods are computationally inefficient, sensitive to initial values, and poorly suited for batch computation. Existing deep learning OPF approaches, which use supervised learning, struggle with ensuring physical consistency and require extensive labeled data.

Method: The authors transform the OPF problem into an energy minimization problem by defining an energy function that measures deviation from constraint satisfaction. Neural networks are trained in an unsupervised manner, directly minimizing physical residuals for 'end-to-end' physics-constrained learning.

Result: The proposed method enables neural networks to learn optimal OPF solutions without pre-solved case data while maintaining physical constraints and minimizing costs.

Conclusion: This unsupervised, physics-constrained learning approach overcomes the limitations of traditional and supervised machine learning methods, offering a computationally efficient alternative for solving OPF problems.

Abstract: Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and planning, aiming to minimize generation costs while satisfying physical constraints such as power flow equations, generator limits, and voltage limits. Traditional OPF solving methods typically employ iterative optimization algorithms (such as interior point methods, sequential quadratic programming, etc.), with limitations including low computational efficiency, initial value sensitivity, and low batch computation efficiency. Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow. Neural networks are trained unsupervised by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true "end-to-end" physics-constrained learning.

Conclusion: CoSineVerifier significantly enhances reasoning verification capabilities, indicating its potential to improve the reasoning powers of large language models.

Abstract: Answer verification methods are widely employed in language model training pipelines spanning data curation, evaluation, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While prior work focus on developing unified verifiers applicable across multiple reasoning scenarios, significant challenges remain in computation-oriented scientific domains, such as algebraic equivalence checking and physical constant substitution. In this paper, we introduce \model, a tool-augmented verifier that leverages external executors to perform precise computations and symbolic simplifications. \model enables robust verification that goes beyond simple semantic matching. We propose a novel two-stage pipeline, which begin with cold-start fine-tuning and followed by multi-turn reinforcement learning with tool integration. Extensive experiments conducted on STEM subjects, general QA, and long-form reasoning tasks demonstrates strong generalization of \model. The results shows that the \model achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerifyBench-Hard and SCI-Bench. And we also employ our \model in RLVR as a reward model, the results show that it consistently outperforms both rubric-based and model-based verifiers on AIME'24 and AIME'25, demonstrating strong potential to enhance reasoning capabilities of LLM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents BARPO, a bilevel framework that reconciles the conflicting goals of optimality and adversarial robustness in deep reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the practical tension and tradeoff observed between SPO and ARPO in deep reinforcement learning, especially in reconciling theory and practice for robustness and performance.

Method: BARPO is proposed as a bilevel optimization framework that modulates the strength of adversaries to ease navigation and unify standard and adversarially robust policy optimization.

Result: BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, retaining robustness without compromising on optimal policy performance.

Conclusion: This framework offers a practical solution to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and empirical performance in adversarially robust deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Achieving optimality and adversarial robustness in deep reinforcement learning has long been regarded as conflicting goals. Nonetheless, recent theoretical insights presented in CAR suggest a potential alignment, raising the important question of how to realize this in practice. This paper first identifies a key gap between theory and practice by comparing standard policy optimization (SPO) and adversarially robust policy optimization (ARPO). Although they share theoretical consistency, a fundamental tension between robustness and optimality arises in practical policy gradient methods. SPO tends toward convergence to vulnerable first-order stationary policies (FOSPs) with strong natural performance, whereas ARPO typically favors more robust FOSPs at the expense of reduced returns. Furthermore, we attribute this tradeoff to the reshaping effect of the strongest adversary in ARPO, which significantly complicates the global landscape by inducing deceptive sticky FOSPs. This improves robustness but makes navigation more challenging. To alleviate this, we develop the BARPO, a bilevel framework unifying SPO and ARPO by modulating adversary strength, thereby facilitating navigability while preserving global optima. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BARPO consistently outperforms vanilla ARPO, providing a practical approach to reconcile theoretical and empirical performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the under-explored architectural space in Diffusion MoE models, which has been overshadowed by developments in routing mechanisms, and to identify key factors for their improvement.

Method: The authors systematically studied architectural configurations such as DeepSeek-style experts, intermediate widths, expert counts, and attention positional encodings. They designed novel architectures for latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks.

Result: The study demonstrates that tuning architectural configurations yields higher performance gains than routing innovations alone. The proposed models surpass strong baselines while using the same or fewer activated parameters.

Conclusion: Efficient and robust Diffusion MoE models can be developed by carefully optimizing architectural configurations, with significant performance gains that outperform existing methods. Code and models are made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent efforts on Diffusion Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have primarily focused on developing more sophisticated routing mechanisms. However, we observe that the underlying architectural configuration space remains markedly under-explored. Inspired by the MoE design paradigms established in large language models (LLMs), we identify a set of crucial architectural factors for building effective Diffusion MoE models--including DeepSeek-style expert modules, alternative intermediate widths, varying expert counts, and enhanced attention positional encodings. Our systematic study reveals that carefully tuning these configurations is essential for unlocking the full potential of Diffusion MoE models, often yielding gains that exceed those achieved by routing innovations alone. Through extensive experiments, we present novel architectures that can be efficiently applied to both latent and pixel-space diffusion frameworks, which provide a practical and efficient training recipe that enables Diffusion MoE models to surpass strong baselines while using equal or fewer activated parameters.

TL;DR: SparseSpec improves memory utilization and throughput speeds for reasoning language models by introducing sparse attention-based speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning language models face memory bandwidth challenges due to long chain-of-thought generations, creating inference inefficiencies.

Method: SparseSpec combines sparse attention (PillarAttn) for speculative token drafting with system optimizations like batching, overlapping verification, and dynamic cache management.

Result: SparseSpec achieves up to 2.13x speedup in throughput compared to existing solutions across multiple models and datasets.

Conclusion: SparseSpec effectively overcomes memory-bound bottlenecks and improves performance in reasoning tasks, making it a scalable framework for language model inference.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth.
  To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first sample complexity analysis for flow-matching generative models, establishing that neural networks can achieve good performance with sufficient samples under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the theoretical foundations of flow matching generative models, which have shown empirical success, but lack theoretical sample complexity insights.

Method: The authors analyze the sample complexity of flow-matching models by breaking down the velocity field estimation error into approximation error, statistical error, and optimization error, and addressing each term individually with rigorous techniques.

Result: They demonstrate that, with standard assumptions and an expressive neural network, a velocity field can be learned with sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$, achieving a Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and true distributions of $\mathcal{O}(ε)$.

Conclusion: This work provides a critical theoretical understanding of the sample complexity in flow-matching models, offering insights into their effectiveness and pointing toward methods for achieving optimal performance.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, offering faster sampling and simpler training by learning continuous flows governed by ordinary differential equations. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of flow matching remains limited, particularly in terms of sample complexity results. In this work, we provide the first analysis of the sample complexity for flow-matching based generative models without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) of the loss function for estimating the velocity field. Under standard assumptions on the loss function for velocity field estimation and boundedness of the data distribution, we show that a sufficiently expressive neural network can learn a velocity field such that with $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ samples, such that the Wasserstein-2 distance between the learned and the true distribution is less than $\mathcal{O}(ε)$. The key technical idea is to decompose the velocity field estimation error into neural-network approximation error, statistical error due to the finite sample size, and optimization error due to the finite number of optimization steps for estimating the velocity field. Each of these terms are then handled via techniques that may be of independent interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling LLMs in parameter count makes deployment on commodity hardware challenging. Current quantization techniques often degrade performance due to outlier features, and state-of-the-art methods require calibration data, which poses issues for data privacy and availability.

Method: The proposed method uses a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify weights. It selects critical top-k weights aligned with principal components in FP32 while quantizing residual weights.

Result: The SVD-based method outperformed state-of-the-art techniques like AWQ and SpQR in tasks such as RTE, achieving 66.06% accuracy compared to 65.34%, while not requiring calibration data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated that intrinsic structural importance can effectively correlate with model performance, providing a robust and privacy-preserving alternative for weight saliency in post-training quantization.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to scale in parameter count, deploying them on commodity hardware has become increasingly challenging. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) addresses this by reducing the precision of model weights, typically to 4-bit or lower. However, uniform quantization often leads to significant performance degradation due to the presence of ``outlier features'' -- weights that, while few in number, are critical for maintaining model accuracy. Current state-of-the-art methods such as AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and SpQR (Sparse Quantization Representations) rely on calibration data to identify these salient weights via activation magnitudes or Hessian sensitivity. In scenarios where data privacy is paramount or calibration data is unavailable, these methods are inapplicable.
  In this work, we propose a data-free, structure-aware hypothesis: that the weights identified as Principal Components via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are intrinsically important to the model's downstream performance. We introduce a novel selection heuristic that preserves the top-$k$ weights aligned with the principal components in FP32, while aggressively quantizing the residual weights. We compare our method against activation-aware (AWQ) and second-order (SpQR) methods across GLUE benchmarks (MRPC, RTE, QNLI) using a DistilBERT backbone. Our experiments reveal that structural importance is highly correlated with functional importance. On the challenging RTE task, our SVD-based method achieves an accuracy of 66.06\%, outperforming both AWQ (65.34\%) and SpQR (65.34\%) at high protection budgets, validating that intrinsic matrix structure can serve as a robust proxy for weight saliency without the need for forward passes or calibration data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve neural prediction for forecasting neurocognitive functions and disorders while addressing challenges like domain shift and label scarcity.

Method: The Directed Evolution Model (DEM) mimics biological directed evolution, incorporates replay buffer, and continual backpropagate methods for reinforcement learning and continuous learning.

Result: DEM enhances neural MRI data's predictive performance on post-implantation outcomes in children with cochlear implants, improving generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: DEM effectively addresses challenges of label scarcity and cross-domain prediction, potentially advancing personalized medical AI applications.

Abstract: Neural prediction offers a promising approach to forecasting the individual variability of neurocognitive functions and disorders and providing prognostic indicators for personalized invention. However, it is challenging to translate neural predictive models into medical artificial intelligent applications due to the limitations of domain shift and label scarcity. Here, we propose the directed evolution model (DEM), a novel computational model that mimics the trial-and-error processes of biological directed evolution to approximate optimal solutions for predictive modeling tasks. We demonstrated that the directed evolution algorithm is an effective strategy for uncertainty exploration, enhancing generalization in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, by incorporating replay buffer and continual backpropagate methods into DEM, we provide evidence of achieving better trade-off between exploitation and exploration in continuous learning settings. We conducted experiments on four different datasets for children with cochlear implants whose spoken language developmental outcomes vary considerably on the individual-child level. Preoperative neural MRI data has shown to accurately predict the post-operative outcome of these children within but not across datasets. Our results show that DEM can efficiently improve the performance of cross-domain pre-implantation neural predictions while addressing the challenge of label scarcity in target domain.

TL;DR: This study proposes a novel evaluation method for visual spatial cognitive function impairment in Alzheimer's Disease patients using a dynamic handwriting feature extraction model, achieving 86.69% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses biases in evaluating visual spatial cognitive ability in Alzheimer's Disease patients, particularly for less-educated elderly individuals, using the Cube Copying Test.

Method: Dynamic handwriting data was collected via Cogni-CareV3.0 software and analyzed using a BiLSTM-Attention model to classify cognitive ability based on spatial and motion features of handwriting.

Result: The method achieved notable accuracy (86.69%) in classification and revealed regularities in cube drawing abilities by cognitive status, age, and education levels. Age negatively impacts these cognitive scores, while education level positively correlates.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a comprehensive and objective approach for early screening and intervention of visual spatial cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s patients.

Abstract: Background: Impairment of visual spatial cognitive function is the most common early clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) uses the "0/1" binary method ("pass/fail") to evaluate the visual spatial cognitive ability represented by the Cube Copying Test(CCT), the elder with less formal education generally score 0 point, resulting in serious bias in the evaluation results. Therefore, this study proposes a fine evaluation method for CCT based on dynamic handwriting feature extraction of DH-SCSM-BLA. method : The Cogni-CareV3.0 software independently developed by our team was used to collect dynamic handwriting data of CCT. Then, the spatial and motion features of segmented dynamic handwriting were extracted, and feature matrix with unequal dimensions were normalized. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network model combined with attention mechanism (BiLSTM-Attention) was adopted for classification. Result: The experimental results showed that: The proposed method has significant superiority compared to similar studies, with a classification accuracy of 86.69%. The distribution of cube drawing ability scores has significant regularity for three aspects such as MCI patients and healthy control group, age, and levels of education. It was also found that score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score is negatively correlated with age. Score for each cognitive task including cube drawing ability score, but positively correlated with levels of education significantly. Conclusion: This study provides a relatively objective and comprehensive evaluation method for early screening and personalized intervention of visual spatial cognitive impairment.

TL;DR: A new framework, ECCFM, is introduced for faster and more accurate one-step decoding in Error Correction Codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing neural decoders for reliable yet computationally efficient communication remains challenging, especially for low-latency applications.

Method: The paper introduces ECCFM, a training framework using Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equations (PF-ODE) and time regularization to enable smooth, accurate, one-step decoding from noisy signals to codewords.

Result: ECCFM achieves lower bit-error rates compared to prior methods while significantly speeding up inference by 30x to 100x.

Conclusion: ECCFM advances decoding by providing both higher accuracy and drastically faster inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Error Correction Codes (ECC) are fundamental to reliable digital communication, yet designing neural decoders that are both accurate and computationally efficient remains challenging. Recent denoising diffusion decoders with transformer backbones achieve state-of-the-art performance, but their iterative sampling limits practicality in low-latency settings. We introduce the Error Correction Consistency Flow Model (ECCFM), an architecture-agnostic training framework for high-fidelity one-step decoding. By casting the reverse denoising process as a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) and enforcing smoothness through a differential time regularization, ECCFM learns to map noisy signals along the decoding trajectory directly to the original codeword in a single inference step. Across multiple decoding benchmarks, ECCFM attains lower bit-error rates (BER) than autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines, with notable improvements on longer codes, while delivering inference speeds up from 30x to 100x faster than denoising diffusion decoders.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a framework that integrates Large Language Models into energy system modeling to enhance interpretability and accessibility for non-expert stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy system models are complex and technical, making it challenging for non-experts like policymakers and planners to understand and act on their outputs. As energy transitions become more intricate, there is a need for accessible, interpretable tools.

Method: The RE-LLM framework combines optimization-based scenario exploration, machine learning surrogates for faster simulations, and natural language generation via LLMs to convert technical results into understandable explanations.

Result: The RE-LLM reduces computational demands and improves interpretability, allowing for real-time analysis of energy trade-offs and policies. It is adaptable to various platforms and scenarios.

Conclusion: RE-LLM bridges the gap between technical modeling results and actionable decision-making, promoting accessible and interactive engagement for sustainable energy transitions.

Abstract: Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.

Motivation: To investigate whether generative statistical downscaling models, which focus on fine-scale precipitation predictions, can generalize to geographic regions they haven't been trained on.

Method: The paper uses ERA5 reanalysis data and IMERG precipitation estimates as training targets, with a hierarchical location-based data split to evaluate model performance in 15 global regions.

Result: The results demonstrate the models' performance in generalizing across diverse geographic areas, offering insights into their capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: Generative downscaling models hold promise for global-scale applications but require further exploration to optimize generalization across diverse geographic areas.

Abstract: Deep learning offers promising capabilities for the statistical downscaling of climate and weather forecasts, with generative approaches showing particular success in capturing fine-scale precipitation patterns. However, most existing models are region-specific, and their ability to generalize to unseen geographic areas remains largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluate the generalization performance of generative downscaling models across diverse regions. Using a global framework, we employ ERA5 reanalysis data as predictors and IMERG precipitation estimates at $0.1^\circ$ resolution as targets. A hierarchical location-based data split enables a systematic assessment of model performance across 15 regions around the world.

*Benjamin Ramtoula,Pierre-Yves Lajoie,Paul Newman,Daniele De Martini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Combined backBones (ComBo), a method to combine diverse representations from foundation models for better task-specific predictions, outperforming existing approaches in efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models (FMs) differ in their representations, making some more effective for specific tasks. Existing adaptation methods do not fully exploit the complementary strengths of multiple models.

Method: The authors propose ComBo, a probing-based adapter that compresses activations from one or more FMs into compact representations and uses a lightweight transformer for predictions. It avoids dataset-specific tuning and backpropagation through the FM backbones.

Result: ComBo achieves superior performance on the VTAB-1k benchmark's 19 tasks compared to previous methods, surpassing even expensive alternatives like model-merging techniques.

Conclusion: ComBo provides a scalable, efficient, and general-purpose framework for integrating features from diverse foundation models, simplifying task adaptation and boosting performance.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) trained with different objectives and data learn diverse representations, making some more effective than others for specific downstream tasks. Existing adaptation strategies, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, focus on individual models and do not exploit the complementary strengths across models. Probing methods offer a promising alternative by extracting information from frozen models, but current techniques do not scale well with large feature sets and often rely on dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. We propose Combined backBones (ComBo), a simple and scalable probing-based adapter that effectively integrates features from multiple models and layers. ComBo compresses activations from layers of one or more FMs into compact token-wise representations and processes them with a lightweight transformer for task-specific prediction. Crucially, ComBo does not require dataset-specific tuning or backpropagation through the backbone models. However, not all models are equally relevant for all tasks. To address this, we introduce a mechanism that leverages ComBo's joint multi-backbone probing to efficiently evaluate each backbone's task-relevance, enabling both practical model comparison and improved performance through selective adaptation. On the 19 tasks of the VTAB-1k benchmark, ComBo outperforms previous probing methods, matches or surpasses more expensive alternatives, such as distillation-based model merging, and enables efficient probing of tuned models. Our results demonstrate that ComBo offers a practical and general-purpose framework for combining diverse representations from multiple FMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EXCAP, a framework for interpretable time-series modeling addressing temporal patterns and causal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable AI methods lack the capacity to interpret temporal structures in long time series effectively, undermining trust and usability in crucial domains.

Method: The framework consists of an attention-based segmenter for temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism for stable representations.

Result: EXCAP delivers accurate predictions and produces coherent, causally informed explanations, validated through theoretical analysis and experimental benchmarks.

Conclusion: EXCAP is a scalable, principled framework that enhances the interpretability of long time series, making it suitable for critical areas like healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Explainability is essential for neural networks that model long time series, yet most existing explainable AI methods only produce point-wise importance scores and fail to capture temporal structures such as trends, cycles, and regime changes. This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations. These results show that EXCAP offers a principled and scalable approach to interpretable modeling of long time series with relevance to high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in applying FNOs due to incomplete understanding of their theoretical and practical aspects, thereby enabling their reliable application across science and engineering.

Method: The paper unifies the theoretical principles of FNOs with practical implementation strategies, offering an intuitive explanation of operator theory and signal-processing, and integrates its findings with the NeuralOperator library for practical use.

Result: The authors provide a modular and state-of-the-art implementation via the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library that reflects the theoretical principles while improving practical usability.

Conclusion: By combining rigorous theory with practical guidance, the paper creates a reliable, clear framework to help practitioners apply Fourier Neural Operators effectively in diverse fields.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide variety of dynamical processes in science and engineering, yet obtaining their numerical solutions often requires high-resolution discretizations and repeated evaluations of complex operators, leading to substantial computational costs. Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful framework for learning mappings between function spaces directly from data, enabling efficient surrogate models for PDE systems. Among these architectures, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has become the most influential and widely adopted due to its elegant spectral formulation, which captures global correlations through learnable transformations in Fourier space while remaining invariant to discretization and resolution. Despite their success, the practical use of FNOs is often hindered by an incomplete understanding among practitioners of their theoretical foundations, practical constraints, and implementation details, which can lead to their incorrect or unreliable application. This work presents a comprehensive and practice-oriented guide to FNOs, unifying their mathematical principles with implementation strategies. We provide an intuitive exposition to the concepts of operator theory and signal-processing that underlie the FNO, detail its spectral parameterization and the computational design of all its components, and address common misunderstandings encountered in the literature. The exposition is closely integrated with the NeuralOperator 2.0.0 library, offering modular state-of-the-art implementations that faithfully reflect the theory. By connecting rigorous foundations with practical insight, this guide aims to establish a clear and reliable framework for applying FNOs effectively across diverse scientific and engineering fields.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DTS, an efficient method for merging models into multi-task systems with minimal performance loss and storage requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods often degrade performance on similar tasks. DTS aims to preserve task-specific information to mitigate this issue.

Method: DTS employs singular value decomposition to retain crucial components, introduces thresholding strategies for element groups, and scales based on semantic similarities for generalization.

Result: DTS achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines while maintaining minimal storage needs (1% per task). It also demonstrates improved generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: DTS effectively addresses performance degradation in model merging, enabling reliable multi-task systems with efficient storage and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling multi-task capabilities without additional training. However, existing methods often experience substantial performance degradation compared with individually fine-tuned models, even on similar tasks, underscoring the need to preserve task-specific information. This paper proposes Decomposition, Thresholding, and Scaling (DTS), an approximation-based personalized merging framework that preserves task-specific information with minimal storage overhead. DTS first applies singular value decomposition to the task-specific information and retains only a small subset of singular values and vectors. It then introduces a novel thresholding strategy that partitions singular vector elements into groups and assigns a scaling factor to each group. To enable generalization to unseen tasks, we further extend DTS with a variant that fuses task-specific information in a data-free manner based on the semantic similarity of task characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1\% additional storage per task. Furthermore, experiments on unseen tasks show that the DTS variant achieves significantly better generalization performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/krumpguo/DTS.

Motivation: Bayesian Neural Networks struggle with exact posterior inference due to computational intractability, and traditional methods like the Laplace approximation fail to scale and provide accurate posterior distributions in deep networks.

Conclusion: The paper presents a practical, scalable alternative for Bayesian inference in deep learning, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks provide a principled framework for uncertainty quantification by modeling the posterior distribution of network parameters. However, exact posterior inference is computationally intractable, and widely used approximations like the Laplace method struggle with scalability and posterior accuracy in modern deep networks. In this work, we revisit sampling techniques for posterior exploration, proposing a simple variation tailored to efficiently sample from the posterior in over-parameterized networks by leveraging the low-dimensional structure of loss minima. Building on this, we introduce a model that learns a deformation of the parameter space, enabling rapid posterior sampling without requiring iterative methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive posterior approximations with improved scalability compared to recent refinement techniques. These contributions provide a practical alternative for Bayesian inference in deep learning.

*Mengyao Du,Gang Yang,Han Fang,Quanjun Yin,Ee-chien Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework called label forensics to infer the semantic meanings of labels in undocumented, black-box text classifiers through optimized sentence embeddings, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by concerns over the opacity of black-box text classifiers, which often expose only hard-label outputs and pose challenges for forensic auditing and interpretation, especially in unregulated web environments.

Method: The authors propose 'label forensics,' a black-box framework that reconstructs semantic meanings of labels by creating a sentence embedding distribution optimized through semantic neighborhood sampling and iterative optimization to achieve precise and general representation.

Result: Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieved an average label consistency of 92.24%, validating the framework's ability to capture label semantics. It was further applied to a HuggingFace classifier for fine-grained auditing.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses opacity in black-box classifiers by enabling semantic interpretation of their labels, supporting responsible AI auditing and improving transparency.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of natural language processing techniques has led to an unprecedented growth of text classifiers across the modern web. Yet many of these models circulate with their internal semantics undocumented or even intentionally withheld. Such opaque classifiers, which may expose only hard-label outputs, can operate in unregulated web environments or be repurposed for unknown intents, raising legitimate forensic and auditing concerns. In this paper, we position ourselves as investigators and work to infer the semantic concept each label encodes in an undocumented black-box classifier.
  Specifically, we introduce label forensics, a black-box framework that reconstructs a label's semantic meaning. Concretely, we represent a label by a sentence embedding distribution from which any sample reliably reflects the concept the classifier has implicitly learned for that label. We believe this distribution should maintain two key properties: precise, with samples consistently classified into the target label, and general, covering the label's broad semantic space. To realize this, we design a semantic neighborhood sampler and an iterative optimization procedure to select representative seed sentences that jointly maximize label consistency and distributional coverage. The final output, an optimized seed sentence set combined with the sampler, constitutes the empirical distribution representing the label's semantics. Experiments on multiple black-box classifiers achieve an average label consistency of around 92.24 percent, demonstrating that the embedding regions accurately capture each classifier's label semantics. We further validate our framework on an undocumented HuggingFace classifier, enabling fine-grained label interpretation and supporting responsible AI auditing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address real-world vehicle routing problems involving travel time uncertainty and multiple objectives like operational efficiency and labor regulations.

Method: The authors develop a deep learning model with an attention mechanism and scenario clustering to handle both stochasticity and multi-objectivity in routing.

Result: The model demonstrates the ability to construct a high-quality Pareto Front within acceptable times, outperforming three baseline methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based approaches show promise for solving complex, uncertain, and multi-objective routing problems, providing practical computational advantages.

Abstract: In this work, we consider learning-based applications in routing to solve a Vehicle Routing variant characterized by stochasticity and multiple objectives. Such problems are representative of practical settings where decision-makers have to deal with uncertainty in the operational environment as well as multiple conflicting objectives due to different stakeholders. We specifically consider travel time uncertainty. We also consider two objectives, total travel time and route makespan, that jointly target operational efficiency and labor regulations on shift length, although different objectives could be incorporated. Learning-based methods offer earnest computational advantages as they can repeatedly solve problems with limited interference from the decision-maker. We specifically focus on end-to-end deep learning models that leverage the attention mechanism and multiple solution trajectories. These models have seen several successful applications in routing problems. However, since travel times are not a direct input to these models due to the large dimensions of the travel time matrix, accounting for uncertainty is a challenge, especially in the presence of multiple objectives. In turn, we propose a model that simultaneously addresses stochasticity and multi-objectivity and provide a refined training mechanism for this model through scenario clustering to reduce training time. Our results show that our model is capable of constructing a Pareto Front of good quality within acceptable run times compared to three baselines.

Motivation: To understand whether LLMs exhibit altruistic tendencies and if their implicit associations and self-reports align with actual behavior.

Method: The study uses a multi-method approach with 24 LLMs, involving an Implicit Association Test (IAT), a forced binary choice task for behavioral altruism, and a self-assessment scale for explicit altruism beliefs.

Result: Key results show strong implicit altruism bias, above-chance behavioral altruism, lack of correlation between implicit bias and behavior, and overestimation of altruistic self-reports compared to actual behavior.

Conclusion: The paper proposes the Calibration Gap as a metric for aligning LLMs, emphasizing the importance of behaviors matching self-assessments for predictability and consistency.

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cas-Sensing, a framework to reconstruct fields from sparse and random measurements using a hierarchical model combining autoencoders and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing full data fields from extremely sparse and random measurements, which is a longstanding problem in inverse problem-solving.

Method: The method involves a hierarchical reconstruction framework. A neural operator-based autoencoder first reconstructs dominant structures from sparse inputs. Then, a conditional diffusion model refines details via a mask-cascade training strategy and measurement consistency using Bayesian posterior sampling.

Result: Cas-Sensing achieves accurate and robust reconstructions across various sensor configurations and geometries, as demonstrated on simulation and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Cas-Sensing provides a generalizable and practical approach to address ill-posed inverse problems, with applicability in scientific and engineering fields.

Abstract: Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel anomaly detection framework, ICAD-LLM, utilizing large language models for handling diverse data modalities and offering strong generalization to new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods are inadequate for rapidly evolving environments with heterogeneous data modalities and require better generalization capabilities.

Method: The ICAD paradigm defines anomalies as deviations from a reference set of normal data, utilizing large language models' in-context learning for unified anomaly detection across multiple data modalities.

Result: ICAD-LLM achieves comparable performance to specialized anomaly detection methods and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen tasks with reduced deployment costs.

Conclusion: ICAD-LLM provides a unified framework capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains, offering an efficient and adaptive solution for modern systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.

TL;DR: The paper presents a neural operator framework that predicts atrial activation times across diverse anatomies with high accuracy and speed, suitable for real-time and large-scale clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational intensity of biophysical simulations, making them inadequate for real-time use or population-scale studies in atrial arrhythmia treatment.

Method: The study created a dataset of 308,700 simulations on diverse patient-specific geometries, used a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, and implemented a vision-transformer-backed neural operator to map inputs to electrical activation times.

Result: The model achieves a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over 455 ms simulations and performs inference within 0.12 ms per sample, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: This framework enables efficient prediction of biophysical patterns across anatomical variations, supporting integration into clinical workflows for real-time and large-scale analyses.

Abstract: Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-GT (spatio-temporal gradient tracking) improves communication efficiency in distributed and federated learning by addressing data heterogeneity and gradient noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to reduce communication overhead in distributed and federated learning caused by data heterogeneity and gradient noise when multiple local updates occur.

Method: The authors revisit and enhance Scaffold by introducing ST-GT, which tracks global and local gradients in a unified manner to mitigate heterogeneity and suppress gradient noise.

Result: ST-GT achieves linear convergence for strongly convex problems and reduces noise to $σ^2/τ$, achieving significant communication efficiency gains.

Conclusion: ST-GT offers a significant advancement by improving convergence speed and communication efficiency, addressing key challenges in distributed learning.

Abstract: In distributed and federated learning algorithms, communication overhead is often reduced by performing multiple local updates between communication rounds. However, due to data heterogeneity across nodes and the local gradient noise within each node, this strategy can lead to the drift of local models away from the global optimum. To address this issue, we revisit the well-known federated learning method Scaffold (Karimireddy et al., 2020) under a gradient tracking perspective, and propose a unified spatio-temporal gradient tracking algorithm, termed ST-GT, for distributed stochastic optimization over time-varying graphs. ST-GT tracks the global gradient across neighboring nodes to mitigate data heterogeneity, while maintaining a running average of local gradients to substantially suppress noise, with slightly more storage overhead. Without assuming bounded data heterogeneity, we prove that ST-GT attains a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems and a sublinear rate for nonconvex cases. Notably, ST-GT achieves the first linear speed-up in communication complexity with respect to the number of local updates per round $τ$ for the strongly-convex setting. Compared to traditional gradient tracking methods, ST-GT reduces the topology-dependent noise term from $σ^2$ to $σ^2/τ$, where $σ^2$ denotes the noise level, thereby improving communication efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework where large language models dynamically generate constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs) for solid mechanics tasks, achieving accuracy comparable to manually engineered models while requiring less human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the substantial expert knowledge and human labor required for constitutive modeling in solid mechanics, enabling end-to-end automation using LLMs.

Method: The authors propose a framework where LLMs generate CANNs tailored to specific materials and datasets, incorporating LLM-based architecture selection, physical constraints, and full code generation.

Result: Evaluation on benchmark problems shows that LLM-generated CANNs achieve comparable or better accuracy than manually created counterparts and generalize reliably to new scenarios and larger deformations.

Conclusion: LLM-based generation of neural networks demonstrates significant potential in automating the process of constitutive modeling, reducing expertise barriers and advancing scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agentic frameworks increasingly adopt the paradigm of dynamically generating task-specific agents. We suggest that not only agents but also specialized software modules for scientific and engineering tasks can be generated on demand. We demonstrate this concept in the field of solid mechanics. There, so-called constitutive models are required to describe the relationship between mechanical stress and body deformation. Constitutive models are essential for both the scientific understanding and industrial application of materials. However, even recent data-driven methods of constitutive modeling, such as constitutive artificial neural networks (CANNs), still require substantial expert knowledge and human labor. We present a framework in which an LLM generates a CANN on demand, tailored to a given material class and dataset provided by the user. The framework covers LLM-based architecture selection, integration of physical constraints, and complete code generation. Evaluation on three benchmark problems demonstrates that LLM-generated CANNs achieve accuracy comparable to or greater than manually engineered counterparts, while also exhibiting reliable generalization to unseen loading scenarios and extrapolation to large deformations. These findings indicate that LLM-based generation of physics-constrained neural networks can substantially reduce the expertise required for constitutive modeling and represent a step toward practical end-to-end automation.

Motivation: To address the scalability challenge in neural solvers, specifically the need to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently across millions of spatial elements in industrial-scale physics simulations.

Conclusion: MSPT successfully addresses the scalability problem in neural solvers, enabling simulations on millions of points with high computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: A key scalability challenge in neural solvers for industrial-scale physics simulations is efficiently capturing both fine-grained local interactions and long-range global dependencies across millions of spatial elements. We introduce the Multi-Scale Patch Transformer (MSPT), an architecture that combines local point attention within patches with global attention to coarse patch-level representations. To partition the input domain into spatially-coherent patches, we employ ball trees, which handle irregular geometries efficiently. This dual-scale design enables MSPT to scale to millions of points on a single GPU. We validate our method on standard PDE benchmarks (elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, porous flow) and large-scale aerodynamic datasets (ShapeNet-Car, Ahmed-ML), achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower memory footprint and computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SA-ADP, a sensitivity-aware method for protecting personal information during large language model training, achieving strong privacy without impacting utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns from large language models memorizing personally identifiable information (PII) during training, as traditional methods like DP-SGD degrade model utility.

Method: The method, SA-ADP, introduces sensitivity-based noise allocation during training to protect PII based on its sensitivity, rather than applying uniform noise.

Result: The proposed method was evaluated on four datasets, showing comparable results to non-private models (No-DP) and traditional DP-SGD, with no degradation in utility.

Conclusion: SA-ADP effectively balances privacy protection and model utility, overcoming limitations of conventional methods like DP-SGD.

Abstract: Despite advances in the use of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks, their ability to memorize information has raised privacy concerns. Therefore, protecting personally identifiable information (PII) during LLM training remains a fundamental challenge. Conventional methods like Differential Privacy-Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) provide robust privacy protection via uniform noising, protecting PII regardless of its distinct sensitivity. This comes at the expense of the model's utility, leading to a trade-off. In this paper, we propose SA-ADP, a sensitivity-aware approach that allocates noise based on the sensitivity of individual PII. We evaluated our method on four datasets (ABCD, CUSTOMERSIM, Wikitext-2, and UNSW-NB15 ). Our results show that SA-ADP achieves results comparable to the baseline (No-DP) and the conventional DP-SGD. This means that our method did not degrade the model's utility while still maintaining strong privacy protection.

TL;DR: Mofasa is a state-of-the-art generative model for creating Metal-Organic Frameworks using latent diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a high-performance generative model is motivated by MOFs' vast design space, strong structure-property relations, and their critical applications.

Method: Mofasa employs an all-atom latent diffusion model to jointly sample positions, atom types, and lattice vectors for MOFs up to 500 atoms, avoiding traditional assembly methods.

Result: It successfully generates annotated MOF structures, leading to the release of MofasaDB, a database with a searchable interface.

Conclusion: Mofasa addresses the lack of advanced generative models for MOFs, significantly advancing their design and discovery process.

Abstract: Mofasa is an all-atom latent diffusion model with state-of-the-art performance for generating Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). These are highly porous crystalline materials used to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide, store toxic gases and catalyse chemical reactions. In recognition of their value, the development of MOFs recently received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
  In many ways, MOFs are well-suited for exploiting generative models in chemistry: they are rationally-designable materials with a large combinatorial design space and strong structure-property couplings. And yet, to date, a high performance generative model has been lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce Mofasa, a general-purpose latent diffusion model that jointly samples positions, atom-types and lattice vectors for systems as large as 500 atoms. Mofasa avoids handcrafted assembly algorithms common in the literature, unlocking the simultaneous discovery of metal nodes, linkers and topologies.
  To help the scientific community build on our work, we release MofasaDB, an annotated library of hundreds of thousands of sampled MOF structures, along with a user-friendly web interface for search and discovery: https://mofux.ai/ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if weights can serve as effective representations, especially within neural fields, and how structuring weight space affects performance.

Method: The study uses pre-trained models and employs low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to constrain optimization, enhancing weight space structure. Multiplicative LoRA weights are tested during tasks like reconstruction and generation.

Result: Multiplicative LoRA weights demonstrate high-quality representation, distinctiveness, and semantic structure. In latent diffusion models, they outperform existing methods in generation tasks.

Conclusion: Constrained weight space through LoRA improves representation and enables superior performance in tasks, especially for generative models.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the potential of weights to serve as effective representations, focusing on neural fields. Our key insight is that constraining the optimization space through a pre-trained base model and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) can induce structure in weight space. Across reconstruction, generation, and analysis tasks on 2D and 3D data, we find that multiplicative LoRA weights achieve high representation quality while exhibiting distinctiveness and semantic structure. When used with latent diffusion models, multiplicative LoRA weights enable higher-quality generation than existing weight-space methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why Last-layer retraining (LLR) methods improve worst-group accuracy despite imbalanced held-out sets, finding this is due to better group balance rather than mitigating neural collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLR methods are being examined for their ability to address spurious correlations and improve performance on minority groups in neural networks efficiently.

Method: The authors reframe the hypothesis of why LLR works, investigating its connection to neural collapse and group balancing using empirical evidence and analyzing recently proposed algorithms CB-LLR and AFR.

Result: Empirical findings refute the initial hypothesis (LLR's effect on neural collapse) and instead identify better group balance in held-out sets as the mechanism for robustness improvement.

Conclusion: LLR's success arises from effective group balancing in held-out sets, and recent algorithms like CB-LLR and AFR leverage implicit group balancing for robustness.

Abstract: Last-layer retraining (LLR) methods -- wherein the last layer of a neural network is reinitialized and retrained on a held-out set following ERM training -- have garnered interest as an efficient approach to rectify dependence on spurious correlations and improve performance on minority groups. Surprisingly, LLR has been found to improve worst-group accuracy even when the held-out set is an imbalanced subset of the training set. We initially hypothesize that this ``unreasonable effectiveness'' of LLR is explained by its ability to mitigate neural collapse through the held-out set, resulting in the implicit bias of gradient descent benefiting robustness. Our empirical investigation does not support this hypothesis. Instead, we present strong evidence for an alternative hypothesis: that the success of LLR is primarily due to better group balance in the held-out set. We conclude by showing how the recent algorithms CB-LLR and AFR perform implicit group-balancing to elicit a robustness improvement.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how RL post-training aids in developing compositional generalization, distinguishing it from length generalization, using the Countdown task as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how reinforcement learning impacts compositional generalization when synthesizing novel skills from known components, and to examine the dependencies between the structure of compositions and the transfer of skills.

Method: The authors analyze solutions to the Countdown task using expression trees, tracking tree shapes and their success rates during training to evaluate skill composition and generalization.

Result: The study reveals out-of-distribution generalization to larger structures and previously unseen tree shapes, with a hierarchy of learnability based on composition structure. Models excel at shallow balanced trees but struggle with deep unbalanced or right-heavy ones.

Conclusion: RL post-training facilitates OOD generalization and provides deeper insights into model learning and failure points, beyond traditional evaluation metrics like pass@k.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) successfully enhances reasoning in large language models, its role in fostering compositional generalization (the ability to synthesize novel skills from known components) is often conflated with mere length generalization. To this end, we study what RL post-training teaches about skill composition and how the structure of the composition affects the skill transfer. We focus on the Countdown task (given n numbers and a target, form an expression that evaluates to the target) and analyze model solutions as expression trees, where each subtree corresponds to a reusable subtask and thus can be viewed as a ``skill.'' Tracking tree shapes and their success rates over training, we find: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to larger n and to unseen tree shapes, indicating compositional reuse of subtasks; (ii) a structure-dependent hierarchy of learnability -- models master shallow balanced trees (workload is balanced between subtasks) before deep unbalanced ones, with persistent fragility on right-heavy structures (even when the composition depth is the same as some left-heavy structures). Our diagnostic reveals what is learned, in what order, and where generalization fails, clarifying how RL-only post-training induces OOD generalization beyond what standard metrics such as pass@k reveal.

*Chenhao Sun,Yuhao Mao,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of global noise variance in Randomized Smoothing (RS) and proposes a dual RS framework with input-dependent noise variances for improved robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of global noise variance in RS that hinders its performance across both small and large radii.

Method: The dual RS framework involves a variance estimator predicting optimal input-dependent noise variances and a standard RS classifier deploying these variances, with local constancy ensured via smoothing and iterative optimization strategies.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show significant gains in robustness and accuracy across various radii using the dual RS method, incurring only moderate computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed dual RS method achieves superior certified robustness and accuracy across radii, surpassing previous approaches, and provides a novel perspective on routing for robustness.

Abstract: Randomized Smoothing (RS) is a prominent technique for certifying the robustness of neural networks against adversarial perturbations. With RS, achieving high accuracy at small radii requires a small noise variance, while achieving high accuracy at large radii requires a large noise variance. However, the global noise variance used in the standard RS formulation leads to a fundamental limitation: there exists no global noise variance that simultaneously achieves strong performance at both small and large radii. To break through the global variance limitation, we propose a dual RS framework which enables input-dependent noise variances. To achieve that, we first prove that RS remains valid with input-dependent noise variances, provided the variance is locally constant around each input. Building on this result, we introduce two components which form our dual RS framework: (i) a variance estimator first predicts an optimal noise variance for each input, (ii) this estimated variance is then used by a standard RS classifier. The variance estimator is independently smoothed via RS to ensure local constancy, enabling flexible design. We also introduce training strategies to iteratively optimize the two components. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 show that our dual RS method provides strong performance for both small and large radii-unattainable with global noise variance-while incurring only a 60% computational overhead at inference. Moreover, it consistently outperforms prior input-dependent noise approaches across most radii, with particularly large gains at radii 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, achieving relative improvements of 19%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. On ImageNet, dual RS remains effective across all radii. Additionally, the dual RS framework naturally provides a routing perspective for certified robustness, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off with off-the-shelf expert RS models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an active learning algorithm for classifying strategic agents, addressing challenges like manipulation of data, and demonstrates its efficiency in reducing label queries while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge where strategic agents manipulate features to gain favorable outcomes, which distorts data and makes accurate classification difficult.

Method: The authors adapt the Active Perceptron algorithm to work in strategic environments using uniform data from the unit sphere, ensuring efficient learning while accounting for data manipulation.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves excess error $ε$ with only $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}{ε})$ label queries, maintaining computational efficiency and showing exponential improvement in label complexity over prior methods.

Conclusion: The paper successfully designs an effective and efficient active learning algorithm for strategic classification, highlighting its capability to handle manipulated data while significantly reducing label requests.

Abstract: We initiate the study of active learning algorithms for classifying strategic agents. Active learning is a well-established framework in machine learning in which the learner selectively queries labels, often achieving substantially higher accuracy and efficiency than classical supervised methods-especially in settings where labeling is costly or time-consuming, such as hiring, admissions, and loan decisions. Strategic classification, however, addresses scenarios where agents modify their features to obtain more favorable outcomes, resulting in observed data that is not truthful. Such manipulation introduces challenges beyond those in learning from clean data. Our goal is to design active and noise-tolerant algorithms that remain effective in strategic environments-algorithms that classify strategic agents accurately while issuing as few label requests as possible. The central difficulty is to simultaneously account for strategic manipulation and preserve the efficiency gains of active learning.
  Our main result is an algorithm for actively learning linear separators in the strategic setting that preserves the exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning previously obtained only in the non-strategic case. Specifically, for data drawn uniformly from the unit sphere, we show that a modified version of the Active Perceptron algorithm [DKM05,YZ17] achieves excess error $ε$ using only $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ label queries and incurs at most $\tilde{O}(d \ln \frac{1}ε)$ additional mistakes relative to the optimal classifier, even in the nonrealizable case, when a $\tildeΩ(ε)$ fraction of inputs have inconsistent labels with the optimal classifier. The algorithm is computationally efficient and, under these distributional assumptions, requires substantially fewer label queries than prior work on strategic Perceptron [ABBN21].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, where new task training causes loss of prior knowledge.

Method: They devised the Information Maximization regularizer, a class-agnostic, memory-based regularization approach that can be incorporated into rehearsal-based methods.

Result: The IM regularizer consistently improves baseline performance across datasets, tasks, and domains with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: IM regularizer is practical, scalable, and improves continual learning performance in both standard and complex scenarios like video data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where performance on previous tasks degrades after training on a new task. This issue arises due to the model's tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge with new information. We present a novel approach to address this challenge, focusing on the intersection of memory-based methods and regularization approaches. We formulate a regularization strategy, termed Information Maximization (IM) regularizer, for memory-based continual learning methods, which is based exclusively on the expected label distribution, thus making it class-agnostic. As a consequence, IM regularizer can be directly integrated into various rehearsal-based continual learning methods, reducing forgetting and favoring faster convergence. Our empirical validation shows that, across datasets and regardless of the number of tasks, our proposed regularization strategy consistently improves baseline performance at the expense of a minimal computational overhead. The lightweight nature of IM ensures that it remains a practical and scalable solution, making it applicable to real-world continual learning scenarios where efficiency is paramount. Finally, we demonstrate the data-agnostic nature of our regularizer by applying it to video data, which presents additional challenges due to its temporal structure and higher memory requirements. Despite the significant domain gap, our experiments show that IM regularizer also improves the performance of video continual learning methods.

*Yudi Wu,Wenhao Zhao,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework grounded in Information Bottleneck (IB) theory to analyze diversity in discrete latent generative models (AR, MIM, and Diffusion).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is significant variability in generative diversity across discrete latent generative models, and understanding the underlying strategies for this variability is essential.

Method: The paper proposes modeling generation as a conflict between 'Compression Pressure' (minimizing codebook entropy) and 'Diversity Pressure' (maximizing conditional entropy). It decomposes diversity into 'Path Diversity' and 'Execution Diversity' and introduces inference-time interventions to analyze generative strategies.

Result: The framework identifies three strategies: 'Diversity-Prioritized' in MIM, 'Compression-Prioritized' in AR, and 'Decoupled' in Diffusion systems.

Conclusion: The analysis provides insights into behavioral differences across generative models and offers a new approach for enhancing diversity during inference time.

Abstract: Generative diversity varies significantly across discrete latent generative models such as AR, MIM, and Diffusion. We propose a diagnostic framework, grounded in Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, to analyze the underlying strategies resolving this behavior. The framework models generation as a conflict between a 'Compression Pressure' - a drive to minimize overall codebook entropy - and a 'Diversity Pressure' - a drive to maximize conditional entropy given an input. We further decompose this diversity into two primary sources: 'Path Diversity', representing the choice of high-level generative strategies, and 'Execution Diversity', the randomness in executing a chosen strategy. To make this decomposition operational, we introduce three zero-shot, inference-time interventions that directly perturb the latent generative process and reveal how models allocate and express diversity. Application of this probe-based framework to representative AR, MIM, and Diffusion systems reveals three distinct strategies: "Diversity-Prioritized" (MIM), "Compression-Prioritized" (AR), and "Decoupled" (Diffusion). Our analysis provides a principled explanation for their behavioral differences and informs a novel inference-time diversity enhancement technique.

*Mingxuan Hu,Hongbo Ma,Xinlan Wu,Ziqi Liu,Jiaqi Liu,Yangbin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed Counterfactual Debiasing Framework addresses gender bias in audio-based depression detection models by using causal inference techniques to enhance fairness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-based depression detection models often correlate gender with depression outcomes due to imbalanced training data, leading to unfair diagnosis for males and females.

Method: A causal graph models the decision-making process to isolate gender bias, and counterfactual inference is used to remove the direct causal effect of gender on predictions.

Result: The framework showed reduced gender bias and improved overall detection performance when tested on the DAIC-WOZ dataset with advanced acoustic backbones.

Conclusion: Counterfactual Debiasing effectively mitigates gender bias while enhancing performance in depression detection models, addressing fairness issues.

Abstract: Audio-based depression detection models have demonstrated promising performance but often suffer from gender bias due to imbalanced training data. Epidemiological statistics show a higher prevalence of depression in females, leading models to learn spurious correlations between gender and depression. Consequently, models tend to over-diagnose female patients while underperforming on male patients, raising significant fairness concerns. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Debiasing Framework grounded in causal inference. We construct a causal graph to model the decision-making process and identify gender bias as the direct causal effect of gender on the prediction. During inference, we employ counterfactual inference to estimate and subtract this direct effect, ensuring the model relies primarily on authentic acoustic pathological features. Extensive experiments on the DAIC-WOZ dataset using two advanced acoustic backbones demonstrate that our framework not only significantly reduces gender bias but also improves overall detection performance compared to existing debiasing strategies.

*Philippe Rigollet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a mathematical framework for understanding Transformer attention as an interacting particle system, analyzing clustering phenomena and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper mathematical understanding of Transformer models, specifically their attention mechanisms, by interpreting them as particle systems and studying their behaviors.

Method: The authors use mathematical tools including mean-field dynamics, Wasserstein gradient flows, and clustering models (e.g., Kuramoto) to analyze attention mechanisms in Transformers.

Result: They identify a global clustering phenomenon where tokens form clusters after metastable states, describe effects of normalization schemes, contraction speeds, and phase transitions in long-context attention.

Conclusion: The findings explain representation collapse mechanisms in Transformers and suggest regimes that maintain diverse, expressive structures in attention systems.

Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention continuous on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.

### [604] [Unifying Sign and Magnitude for Optimizing Deep Vision Networks via ThermoLion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01881)
*Ahmed Nebli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ThermoLion, a vision-centric optimization framework using dynamic bitrate modulation and Momentum Alignment for superior training of deep vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization methods impose static compromises on gradient information, either amplifying noise or losing fine-grained information, which limits convergence efficiency.

Method: Proposes ThermoLion, featuring local Signal-to-Noise Ratio gating for adaptive bitrate modulation and Momentum Alignment to enhance gradient convergence.

Result: Empirical testing on 12 vision datasets shows ThermoLion surpasses AdamW and Lion in both speed of convergence and final accuracy.

Conclusion: ThermoLion offers a hyperparameter-free solution that dynamically and effectively optimizes deep vision models, outperforming existing methods without requiring architecture-specific tuning.

Abstract: The training of deep vision models is fundamentally a signal recovery problem amidst high-dimensional stochastic noise. Current optimization paradigms impose a static compromise on information channel capacity. For instance, magnitude-based methods, such as AdamW, operate on the assumption that gradient norms are high-fidelity curvature signals. While this allows for precision in smooth regimes, it leads to catastrophic noise amplification when applied to rugged, non-convex landscapes. Conversely, sign-based methods (e.g., Lion) perform a radical 1-bit quantization of the gradient, which aims to provide robust regularization at the cost of discarding fine-grained descent information. We propose that optimal convergence requires neither static prior, but rather a dynamic modulation of the update bitrate. We introduce \textbf{ThermoLion}, a vision-centric framework that utilizes local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) gating to autonomously transition parameters between a "low-bit" exploration phase and a "high-precision" exploitation phase. Furthermore, we introduce a Momentum Alignment mechanism that detects constructive interference between historical drift and instantaneous gradients to accelerate convergence during stable trajectories. Empirical benchmarks across 12 diverse vision datasets (including CIFAR, SVHN, and GTSRB) demonstrate that ThermoLion serves as a hyperparameter-free generalist, surpassing both AdamW and Lion in convergence speed and terminal accuracy without architecture-specific tuning.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations in the Highway Environment reveal the proposed framework's effectiveness and efficiency in real-time decision-making.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a resource-efficient yet effective solution for high-level decision-making in autonomous vehicles, suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: This work proposes an end-to-end multi-modal reinforcement learning framework for high-level decision-making in autonomous vehicles. The framework integrates heterogeneous sensory input, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and vehicle heading information, through a cross-attention transformer-based perception module. Although transformers have become the backbone of modern multi-modal architectures, their high computational cost limits their deployment in resource-constrained edge environments. To overcome this challenge, we propose a spiking temporal-aware transformer-like architecture that uses ternary spiking neurons for computationally efficient multi-modal fusion. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks in the Highway Environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for real-time autonomous decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient graph neural network (GNN) surrogate using domain decomposition (DD) and transfer learning for simulations on PDEs, focusing on ice sheet dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and efficient surrogate models arises due to large-scale PDE simulations, particularly in uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks demanding extensive evaluations.

Method: Develop a physics-inspired GNN utilizing graph attention on unstructured meshes. Introduce a domain decomposition strategy for parallel training of local GNN surrogates and employ transfer learning for accuracy and efficiency.

Result: The method effectively predicts velocities on high-resolution meshes, significantly reduces training time, and is scalable for massive PDE systems.

Conclusion: Graph-based DD with transfer learning provides an effective and scalable framework for GNN surrogates in PDE systems, with potential applications beyond the demonstrated ice sheet simulations.

Abstract: Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the application of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in KG link prediction using TransE embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural embedding models for knowledge graphs face catastrophic forgetting when updating with new information sequentially, necessitating solutions for continual learning.

Method: The authors apply Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a regularization-based continual learning approach, on TransE embeddings while evaluating link prediction on the FB15k-237 dataset.

Result: EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, achieving a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training. Relation-based task partitioning showed significantly higher forgetting than random partitioning.

Conclusion: EWC is effective in mitigating catastrophic forgetting in KG continual learning. Task construction and evaluation protocols critically influence outcomes.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) require continual updates as new information emerges, but neural embedding models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. We evaluate Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), a regularization-based continual learning method, on KG link prediction using TransE embeddings on FB15k-237. Across multiple experiments with five random seeds, we find that EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting from 12.62% to 6.85%, a 45.7% reduction compared to naive sequential training. We observe that the task partitioning strategy affects the magnitude of forgetting: relation-based partitioning (grouping triples by relation type) exhibits 9.8 percentage points higher forgetting than randomly partitioned tasks (12.62% vs 2.81%), suggesting that task construction influences evaluation outcomes. While focused on a single embedding model and dataset, our results demonstrate that EWC effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in KG continual learning and highlight the importance of evaluation protocol design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to incorporate delays into spiking neural networks (SNNs) using additional state variables for improved temporal data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the energy-efficient and temporal data processing capabilities of SNNs by enhancing their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies through delays.

Method: A general framework for adding delays into SNNs using additional state variables, applicable to standard spiking neuron models like LIF and adLIF. The approach investigates the impact of delay duration and learnable parameters on performance.

Result: The framework matches existing delay-based SNNs in performance on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset, with improved performance for smaller networks and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating delays into SNNs enhances their capability to process temporal information efficiently, with particular benefits for smaller networks.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are biologically inspired, event-driven models that are suitable for processing temporal data and offer energy-efficient computation when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. In SNNs, richer neuronal dynamic allows capturing more complex temporal dependencies, with delays playing a crucial role by allowing past inputs to directly influence present spiking behavior. We propose a general framework for incorporating delays into SNNs through additional state variables. The proposed mechanism enables each neuron to access a finite temporal input history. The framework is agnostic to neuron models and hence can be seamlessly integrated into standard spiking neuron models such as LIF and adLIF. We analyze how the duration of the delays and the learnable parameters associated with them affect the performance. We investigate the trade-offs in the network architecture due to additional state variables introduced by the delay mechanism. Experiments on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset show that the proposed mechanism matches the performance of existing delay-based SNNs while remaining computationally efficient. Moreover, the results illustrate that the incorporation of delays may substantially improve performance in smaller networks.

*Jacob Searcy,Anish Dulal,Scott Bridgham,Ashley Cordes,Lillian Aoki,Brendan Bohannan,Qing Zhu,Lucas C. R. Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep-learning framework called Footprint-Aware Regression (FAR) that predicts carbon flux at high resolution and combines data from ecosystems and Landsat with strong prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring carbon drawdown over large geographic areas is challenging, especially with discrepancies between spatial scales of flux tower footprints and satellite measurements.

Method: The Footprint-Aware Regression (FAR) model predicts both spatial footprints and pixel-level carbon flux using deep learning, trained on a dataset combining flux tower data and Landsat imagery.

Result: The FAR model achieves high-resolution predictions of carbon flux with an R2 value of 0.78 on test sites across various ecosystems.

Conclusion: FAR presents a novel solution to high-resolution carbon flux prediction, bridging data gaps for better ecosystem-wide carbon monitoring.

Abstract: Natural climate solutions (NCS) offer an approach to mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, monitoring the carbon drawdown of ecosystems over large geographic areas remains challenging. Eddy-flux covariance towers provide ground truth for predictive 'upscaling' models derived from satellite products, but many satellites now produce measurements on spatial scales smaller than a flux tower's footprint. We introduce Footprint-Aware Regression (FAR), a first-of-its-kind, deep-learning framework that simultaneously predicts spatial footprints and pixel-level (30 m scale) estimates of carbon flux. FAR is trained on our AMERI-FAR25 dataset which combines 439 site years of tower data with corresponding Landsat scenes. Our model produces high-resolution predictions and achieves R2 = 0.78 when predicting monthly net ecosystem exchange on test sites from a variety of ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited success of SVRG in deep learning and to explore its foundational connection with Bayesian posterior correction for improved training.

Method: The authors demonstrate that SVRG is a special case of posterior correction in the isotropic-Gaussian family and propose novel extensions using more flexible exponential families, leading to new SVRG variants with Gaussian family corrections.

Result: Two new SVRG variants were derived: a Newton-like version with Hessian corrections and an Adam-like extension, both improving variational training and language model performance.

Conclusion: This work establishes a novel link between SVRG and Bayesian methods, broadening its application in deep learning and enabling improved training techniques for complex models.

Abstract: Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and its variants aim to speed-up training by using gradient corrections, but have seen limited success in deep learning. Here, we show surprising new foundational connections of SVRG to a recently proposed Bayesian method called posterior correction. Specifically, we show that SVRG is recovered as a special case of posterior correction over the isotropic-Gaussian family, while novel extensions are automatically obtained by using more flexible exponential families. We derive two new SVRG variants by using Gaussian families: First, a Newton-like variant that employs novel Hessian corrections, and second, an Adam-like extension that improves pretraining and finetuning of Transformer language models. This is the first work to connect SVRG to Bayes and use it to boost variational training for deep networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents KV Pareto, a framework to optimize memory and accuracy trade-offs for long-context large language models by evaluating and combining optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address memory bottlenecks during inference in long-context LLMs due to the linear growth of key-value cache, exploring optimization techniques for edge deployment.

Method: The study introduces KV Pareto, which systematically evaluates and maps memory vs. accuracy trade-offs using techniques like KV quantization, model weight quantization, and chunked prefill across various LLM architectures.

Result: KV Pareto achieves model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations, offering 68-78% memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss (1-3%) in long-context tasks, validated on benchmarks and extended context lengths.

Conclusion: The practical effectiveness of systematic joint optimization is highlighted for efficient LLM inference, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant memory bottlenecks during inference due to the linear growth of key-value (KV) cache with sequence length. While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference.

*Haoran Qin,Shansita Sharma,Ali Abbasi,Chayne Thrash,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Low-Rank Prehab,' a pre-compression fine-tuning method for neural network compression that minimizes accuracy drop and improves recovery after applying compression techniques like SVD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improved accuracy recovery after neural network compression by conditioning model parameters to be more amenable to low-rank approximation.

Method: The authors propose 'Low-Rank Prehab,' a pre-compression stage that steers model weights towards regions conducive to better low-rank representations, enabling smoother compression and recovery. This is achieved without sacrificing task performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves compression outcomes for large language models and Vision Transformers, significantly reducing accuracy drop and improving post-recovery performance compared to existing techniques like SVD-LLM.

Conclusion: By preparing model weights before compression, Low-Rank Prehab enhances the effectiveness of low-rank approximation techniques and establishes a more robust framework for neural network compression, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Low-rank approximation methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and its variants (e.g., Fisher-weighted SVD, Activation SVD) have recently emerged as effective tools for neural network compression. In this setting, decomposition acts as a "surgical" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as "rehab" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre-compression fine-tuning stage, Low-Rank Prehab, that explicitly encourages low-rank structure in weight matrices while preserving task performance. By conditioning the model before SVD, Prehab steers weights toward spectrally compact regions of the parameter space, enabling smoother low-rank approximation and improved recovery. Experiments on large language models (LLMs) and other Transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), show that Prehab substantially reduces the immediate accuracy drop after compression and consistently improves post-finetuning performance. Across a wide range of compression ratios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based techniques such as SVD-LLM, highlighting the importance of preparing models for compression rather than only improving the compression and recovery stages.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: PORTAL, a new benchmark generator for optimization, introduces refined control over problem features like ruggedness and curvature, improving systematic algorithm analysis and resource generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test suites for continuous optimization are inflexible and narrowly focused, limiting the capability to systematically analyze algorithms and create diverse benchmarks.

Method: PORTAL provides adjustable features such as curvature, conditioning, interactions, and ruggedness using a layered, precise, and transformation-based design that maintains stability and interpretability.

Result: PORTAL enables controlled complexity while addressing previous shortcomings, supports algorithm analysis, and facilitates generation of rich datasets for research and education.

Conclusion: PORTAL resolves prior limitations of landscape generators by offering flexible, detailed control, fostering a versatile tool for optimization research and its practical applications.

Abstract: Benchmarking is central to optimization research, yet existing test suites for continuous optimization remain limited: classical collections are fixed and rigid, while previous generators cover only narrow families of landscapes with restricted variability and control over details. This paper introduces PORTAL (Platform for Optimization Research, Testing, Analysis, and Learning), a general benchmark generator that provides fine-grained, independent control over basin curvature, conditioning, variable interactions, and surface ruggedness. PORTAL's layered design spans from individual components to block-wise compositions of multi-component landscapes with controllable partial separability and imbalanced block contributions. It offers precise control over the shape of each component in every dimension and direction, and supports diverse transformation patterns through both element-wise and coupling operators with compositional sequencing. All transformations preserve component centers and local quadratic structure, ensuring stability and interpretability. A principled neutralization mechanism prevents unintended component domination caused by exponent or scale disparities, which addresses a key limitation of prior landscape generators. On this foundation, transformations introduce complex landscape characteristics, such as multimodality, asymmetry, and heterogeneous ruggedness, in a controlled and systematic way. PORTAL enables systematic algorithm analysis by supporting both isolation of specific challenges and progressive difficulty scaling. It also facilitates the creation of diverse datasets for meta-algorithmic research, tailored benchmark suite design, and interactive educational use. The complete Python and MATLAB source code for PORTAL is publicly available at [https://github.com/EvoMindLab/PORTAL].

*Zhiyuan Wang,Shengcai Liu,Shaofeng Zhang,Ke Tang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel population initialization method (MPI) for evolutionary algorithms, using solving experiences to enhance optimization without problem-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving evolutionary algorithm performance by enhancing initial population quality through a general-purpose approach, particularly under limited function evaluations.

Method: The paper proposes MPI, a method that utilizes solving experience from previously solved problems to initialize populations for binary optimization problems without relying on problem-specific knowledge.

Result: MPI demonstrated significant improvements across diverse binary optimization problem classes, outperforming existing methods and transferring solving experience effectively.

Conclusion: MPI enhances evolutionary algorithm performance across unseen and higher-dimensional problem instances, showcasing its broad applicability and efficiency in binary optimization.

Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are widely used general-purpose optimization methods due to their domain independence. However, under a limited number of function evaluations (#FEs), the performance of EAs is quite sensitive to the quality of the initial population. Obtaining a high-quality initial population without problem-specific knowledge remains a significant challenge. To address this, this work proposes a general-purpose population initialization method, named mixture-of-experience for population initialization (MPI), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. MPI leverages solving experiences from previously solved problems to generate high-quality initial populations for new problems using only a small number of FEs. Its main novelty lies in a general-purpose approach for representing, selecting, and transferring solving experiences without requiring problem-specific knowledge. Extensive experiments are conducted across six binary optimization problem classes, comprising three classic classes and three complex classes from real-world applications. The experience repository is constructed solely based on instances from the three classic classes, while the performance evaluation is performed across all six classes. The results demonstrate that MPI effectively transfers solving experiences to unseen problem classes (i.e., the complex ones) and higher-dimensional problem instances, significantly outperforming existing general-purpose population initialization methods.

To determine whether local learning rules are sufficient for learning, we encode the network architectures and learning dynamics genetically and then apply selection pressure to evolve networks capable of learning the four boolean functions of one variable. The successful networks are analysed and we show how learning behaviour emerges as a distributed property of the entire network. Finally the utility of genetic algorithms as a tool of discovery is discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve offspring quality and algorithm performance by leveraging multi-parent recombination with reduced disruptive variance in Genetic Algorithms.

Method: Developed Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR), which uses binomially weighted combinations of multiple parents, and tested it on diverse benchmark problems.

Result: PWR showed smoother convergence, lower variance, and 9-22% performance improvements over traditional recombination operators.

Conclusion: PWR is effective, adaptable, and enhances the performance of Genetic Algorithms across different tasks and problem types.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations.
  We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.

Motivation: Symbolic Regression aims to combine predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its effectiveness is limited by challenges like parameter optimization, complex model growth, and solution selection.

Method: The approach includes parameter optimization insights, an $ε$-lexicase parent selection method, and a novel simplification technique using memoization and locality-sensitive hashing. These are integrated into a multi-objective SR library.

Result: The proposed methods achieve Pareto-optimal performance on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming other SR approaches.

Conclusion: The work highlights the significance of proposed techniques in improving simplicity and accuracy in Symbolic Regression and validates the contributions via large-scale experiments.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a regression method that aims to discover mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between variables, and it is often implemented through Genetic Programming, a metaphor for the process of biological evolution. Its appeal lies in combining predictive accuracy with interpretable models, but its promise is limited by several long-standing challenges: parameters are difficult to optimize, the selection of solutions can affect the search, and models often grow unnecessarily complex. In addition, current methods must be constantly re-evaluated to understand the SR landscape. This thesis addresses these challenges through a sequence of studies conducted throughout the doctorate, each focusing on an important aspect of the SR search process. First, I investigate parameter optimization, obtaining insights into its role in improving predictive accuracy, albeit with trade-offs in runtime and expression size. Next, I study parent selection, exploring $ε$-lexicase to select parents more likely to generate good performing offspring. The focus then turns to simplification, where I introduce a novel method based on memoization and locality-sensitive hashing that reduces redundancy and yields simpler, more accurate models. All of these contributions are implemented into a multi-objective evolutionary SR library, which achieves Pareto-optimal performance in terms of accuracy and simplicity on benchmarks of real-world and synthetic problems, outperforming several contemporary SR approaches. The thesis concludes by proposing changes to a famous large-scale symbolic regression benchmark suite, then running the experiments to assess the symbolic regression landscape, demonstrating that a SR method with the contributions presented in this thesis achieves Pareto-optimal performance.

### [618] [Revisiting Direct Encoding: Learnable Temporal Dynamics for Static Image Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01687)
*Huaxu He*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study addresses the challenge of handling static images in spiking neural networks (SNNs) and introduces an adaptive phase shift encoding for temporal variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spiking neural networks struggle with effectively modeling static images due to the lack of temporal dynamics, leading to ineffective temporal behavior when static inputs are repeated over time.

Method: The paper introduces a minimal learnable temporal encoding method, which adds adaptive phase shifts to static inputs to create meaningful temporal variations for SNNs.

Result: The research demonstrates that the perceived performance gap between direct and rate-based encodings is primarily due to issues in convolutional learnability and surrogate gradient formulations, not the encoding schemes per se.

Conclusion: Introducing adaptive phase shifts improves temporal variation for static inputs, offering a solution for more effective temporal modeling in SNNs.

Abstract: Handling static images that lack inherent temporal dynamics remains a fundamental challenge for spiking neural networks (SNNs). In directly trained SNNs, static inputs are typically repeated across time steps, causing the temporal dimension to collapse into a rate like representation and preventing meaningful temporal modeling. This work revisits the reported performance gap between direct and rate based encodings and shows that it primarily stems from convolutional learnability and surrogate gradient formulations rather than the encoding schemes themselves. To illustrate this mechanism level clarification, we introduce a minimal learnable temporal encoding that adds adaptive phase shifts to induce meaningful temporal variation from static inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust sampler to generate well-typed functions in functional programming, ensuring type soundness and completeness while leveraging formal language theory.

Method: The approach uses a fixed-parameter tractable reduction from a type system to a context-free grammar, enabling sampling via acyclic finite automata.

Result: The method ensures uniform sampling without replacement for well-typed functions in the language specified by the automaton.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines type soundness and formal language theory principles to create an exact sampler for the target language.

Abstract: We describe an exact sampler for a simply-typed, first-order functional programming language. Given an acyclic finite automaton, $α_{\varnothing}$, it samples a random function uniformly without replacement from well-typed functions in $\mathcal{L}(α_{\varnothing})$. This is achieved via a fixed-parameter tractable reduction from a syntax-directed type system to a context-free grammar, preserving type soundness and completeness w.r.t. $\mathcal{L}(α_{\varnothing})$, while retaining the robust metatheory of formal languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the sample inefficiency and brittleness of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms in real-world applications of robotics.

Result: DREAMer-VXS reduces required environmental interactions by 90%, achieves 45% better exploration efficiency, and demonstrates superior resilience and robust policies in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a more efficient, generalizable, and robust approach to AGV exploration, showcasing the advantages of model-based reinforcement learning in real-world applications.

Abstract: The paradigm of learning-based robotics holds immense promise, yet its translation to real-world applications is critically hindered by the sample inefficiency and brittleness of conventional model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing DREAMer-VXS, a model-based framework for Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) exploration that learns to plan from imagined latent trajectories. Our approach centers on learning a comprehensive world model from partial and high-dimensional LiDAR observations. This world model is composed of a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which learns a compact representation of the environment's structure, and a Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM), which models complex temporal dynamics. By leveraging this learned model as a high-speed simulator, the agent can train its navigation policy almost entirely in imagination. This methodology decouples policy learning from real-world interaction, culminating in a 90% reduction in required environmental interactions to achieve expert-level performance when compared to state-of-the-art model-free SAC baselines. The agent's behavior is guided by an actor-critic policy optimized with a composite reward function that balances task objectives with an intrinsic curiosity bonus, promoting systematic exploration of unknown spaces. We demonstrate through extensive simulated experiments that DREAMer-VXS not only learns orders of magnitude faster but also develops more generalizable and robust policies, achieving a 45% increase in exploration efficiency in unseen environments and superior resilience to dynamic obstacles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion planning requires smooth, collision-free trajectories considering dynamic constraints and task diversity, which existing methods struggle to integrate effectively.

Method: XFlowMP uses Schrodinger bridges as conditional flow matching and score functions to generate motions embracing high-level task configurations and low-level dynamic feasibility.

Result: XFlowMP outperforms baselines in energy efficiency, motion smoothness, and trajectory accuracy across benchmarks, achieving improvements like 39.88% lower energy and 36.36% smoother motions.

Conclusion: XFlowMP enables efficient and realistic motion planning, proving robust for practical robotic applications in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Generative robotic motion planning requires not only the synthesis of smooth and collision-free trajectories but also feasibility across diverse tasks and dynamic constraints. Prior planning methods, both traditional and generative, often struggle to incorporate high-level semantics with low-level constraints, especially the nexus between task configurations and motion controllability. In this work, we present XFlowMP, a task-conditioned generative motion planner that models robot trajectory evolution as entropic flows bridging stochastic noises and expert demonstrations via Schrodinger bridges given the inquiry task configuration. Specifically, our method leverages Schrodinger bridges as a conditional flow matching coupled with a score function to learn motion fields with high-order dynamics while encoding start-goal configurations, enabling the generation of collision-free and dynamically-feasible motions. Through evaluations, XFlowMP achieves up to 53.79% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 36.36% smoother motions, and 39.88% lower energy consumption while comparing to the next-best baseline on the RobotPointMass benchmark, and also reducing short-horizon planning time by 11.72%. On long-horizon motions in the LASA Handwriting dataset, our method maintains the trajectories with 1.26% lower maximum mean discrepancy, 3.96% smoother, and 31.97% lower energy. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method on the Kinova Gen3 manipulator, executing planning motions and confirming its robustness in real-world settings.

Abstract: The robustness of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) is crucial when facing unknown and complex marine environments, especially when heteroscedastic observational noise poses significant challenges to sensor-based navigation tasks. Recently, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL) has shown promising results in some challenging autonomous navigation tasks without prior environmental information.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ICD-Net, a neural network-enhanced framework improving visual-inertial SLAM systems by generating displacement estimates and uncertainties, tightly integrated with VINS-Fusion to enhance state estimation, especially crucial for drone applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM systems often suffer from suboptimal performance due to issues such as sensor imperfections, noisy measurements, and environmental challenges, particularly detrimental in drones where precise state estimation is critical for autonomy.

Method: ICD-Net processes raw inertial data to predict displacement estimates and associated uncertainties. These outputs are integrated into the optimization framework of VINS-Fusion, using the predicted uncertainties to weigh contributions relative to traditional visual-inertial terms.

Result: Experimental tests on high-speed drone scenarios showed ICD-Net improved trajectory estimation, achieving over 38% better mean absolute pose error (APE) while maintaining robustness and real-time capabilities.

Conclusion: ICD-Net enhances SLAM performance by addressing error sources through neural network integration, demonstrating effectiveness in improving accuracy and reliability in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Visual-inertial SLAM systems often exhibit suboptimal performance due to multiple confounding factors including imperfect sensor calibration, noisy measurements, rapid motion dynamics, low illumination, and the inherent limitations of traditional inertial navigation integration methods. These issues are particularly problematic in drone applications where robust and accurate state estimation is critical for safe autonomous operation. In this work, we present ICD-Net, a novel framework that enhances visual-inertial SLAM performance by learning to process raw inertial measurements and generating displacement estimates with associated uncertainty quantification. Rather than relying on analytical inertial sensor models that struggle with real-world sensor imperfections, our method directly extracts displacement maps from sensor data while simultaneously predicting measurement covariances that reflect estimation confidence. We integrate ICD-Net outputs as additional residual constraints into the VINS-Fusion optimization framework, where the predicted uncertainties appropriately weight the neural network contributions relative to traditional visual and inertial terms. The learned displacement constraints provide complementary information that compensates for various error sources in the SLAM pipeline. Our approach can be used under both normal operating conditions and in situations of camera inconsistency or visual degradation. Experimental evaluation on challenging high-speed drone sequences demonstrated that our approach significantly improved trajectory estimation accuracy compared to standard VINS-Fusion, with more than 38% improvement in mean APE and uncertainty estimates proving crucial for maintaining system robustness. Our method shows that neural network enhancement can effectively address multiple sources of SLAM degradation while maintaining real-time performance requirements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISTAv2, an improved method for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) using generative world models and online value maps for more efficient and interpretable planning in real-world continuous spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work in VLN struggles with creating efficient action-conditioned predictions and planning due to the reliance on discrete panoramas, long-horizon objectives, and replacing planners. There is a need for a method that synthesizes egocentric future views while guiding planning with reachability and risk-awareness.

Method: The authors propose VISTAv2, which includes an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor for short-horizon future synthesis, alignment with language instructions via a vision-language scorer, and the generation of egocentric value maps through imagination-to-value mapping. This is done efficiently using VAE latent space rollouts and sparse decoding.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that VISTAv2 outperforms strong baselines on MP3D and RoboTHOR platforms. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the map planner in achieving robust VLN.

Conclusion: VISTAv2 is a practical and interpretable solution for robust VLN, addressing key limitations of prior methods while enabling efficient inference using consumer-grade hardware.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow language instructions while acting in continuous real-world spaces. Prior image imagination based VLN work shows benefits for discrete panoramas but lacks online, action-conditioned predictions and does not produce explicit planning values; moreover, many methods replace the planner with long-horizon objectives that are brittle and slow. To bridge this gap, we propose VISTAv2, a generative world model that rolls out egocentric future views conditioned on past observations, candidate action sequences, and instructions, and projects them into an online value map for planning. Unlike prior approaches, VISTAv2 does not replace the planner. The online value map is fused at score level with the base objective, providing reachability and risk-aware guidance. Concretely, we employ an action-aware Conditional Diffusion Transformer video predictor to synthesize short-horizon futures, align them with the natural language instruction via a vision-language scorer, and fuse multiple rollouts in a differentiable imagination-to-value head to output an imagined egocentric value map. For efficiency, rollouts occur in VAE latent space with a distilled sampler and sparse decoding, enabling inference on a single consumer GPU. Evaluated on MP3D and RoboTHOR, VISTAv2 improves over strong baselines, and ablations show that action-conditioned imagination, instruction-guided value fusion, and the online value-map planner are all critical, suggesting that VISTAv2 offers a practical and interpretable route to robust VLN.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL), which integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization for adaptive healthcare interventions. The method is validated in a simulated dementia care scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning struggles with adaptive healthcare scenarios due to scarce data, need for interpretability, and complex causal patient dynamics. The aim is to overcome these challenges.

Method: The CRL framework utilizes causal discovery and reasoning by incorporating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) describing causal relationships between states and actions into policy optimization.

Result: In a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, CRL showed better performance than model-free RL, achieving higher rewards, consistent patient states, and clinically interpretable behavior.

Conclusion: CRL reinforces the potential of causal reinforcement learning for human-robot interactions, especially in settings requiring interpretability, adaptiveness, and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) faces significant challenges in adaptive healthcare interventions, such as dementia care, where data is scarce, decisions require interpretability, and underlying patient-state dynamic are complex and causal in nature. In this work, we present a novel framework called Causal structure-aware Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that explicitly integrates causal discovery and reasoning into policy optimization. This method enables an agent to learn and exploit a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes the causal dependencies between human behavioral states and robot actions, facilitating more efficient, interpretable, and robust decision-making. We validate our approach in a simulated robot-assisted cognitive care scenario, where the agent interacts with a virtual patient exhibiting dynamic emotional, cognitive, and engagement states. The experimental results show that CRL agents outperform conventional model-free RL baselines by achieving higher cumulative rewards, maintaining desirable patient states more consistently, and exhibiting interpretable, clinically-aligned behavior. We further demonstrate that CRL's performance advantage remains robust across different weighting strategies and hyperparameter settings. In addition, we demonstrate a lightweight LLM-based deployment: a fixed policy is embedded into a system prompt that maps inferred states to actions, producing consistent, supportive dialogue without LLM finetuning. Our work illustrates the promise of causal reinforcement learning for human-robot interaction applications, where interpretability, adaptiveness, and data efficiency are paramount.

This work critically analyzes the integration of value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms alongside neural network architectures, such as feedforward, recurrent, convolutional, graph, and transformer networks, for enhancing agent learning and representation in socially aware navigation. Furthermore, we examine crucial evaluation mechanisms, including metrics, benchmark datasets, simulation environments, and the persistent challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Our comparative analysis of the literature reveals that while DRL significantly improves safety, and human acceptance over traditional approaches, the field still faces setback due to non-uniform evaluation mechanisms, absence of standardized social metrics, computational burdens that limit scalability, and difficulty in transferring simulation to real robotic hardware applications. We assert that future progress will depend on hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of multiple approaches and producing benchmarks that balance technical efficiency with human-centered evaluation.

### [633] [Reinforcement Learning from Implicit Neural Feedback for Human-Aligned Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00050)
*Suzie Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using EEG signals for reinforcement learning, exploring the potential of implicit neural feedback in robotics, achieving results matching manual reward setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning struggles with sparse reward conditions, and reliance on explicit human feedback increases user effort and disruptiveness.

Method: A pre-trained decoder converts EEG signals into reward components for policy learning, validated in a robotic simulation with sparse external rewards.

Result: Decoded EEG feedback enables agents to perform comparably to those trained on dense, manually-crafted rewards in complex robotic tasks.

Conclusion: Implicit neural feedback via EEG holds potential for scalable, less invasive, human-aligned reinforcement learning in robotics.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often struggle to learn effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, enabling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

### [634] [Modeling and Control of Magnetic Forces between Microrobots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00051)
*Amelia Fernández Seguel,Alejandro I. Maass*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of controlling multiple magnetic microrobots under a shared magnetic signal by developing a cascade control system for regulating their radial distances efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current systems where all microrobots move synchronously, restricting their use in biomedical tasks like drug delivery and microsurgeries requiring independent actuation.

Method: Developed a cascade controller using a PID controller for radial distance regulation and a PD controller to smooth transitions, modeled for magnetic dipole interactions in viscous mediums, and simulated the system in MATLAB.

Result: The PID controller reduced convergence to the desired radius by 40%, while the PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes with minimal fluctuations.

Conclusion: The proposed control strategy is effective for independently regulating the distance of two microrobots under a global magnetic field, but it is currently constrained to a 2D environment with two agents, necessitating future research for 3D and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The independent control of multiple magnetic microrobots under a shared global signal presents critical challenges in biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and microsurgeries. Most existing systems only allow all agents to move synchronously, limiting their use in applications that require differentiated actuation. This research aims to design a controller capable of regulating the radial distance between micro-agents using only the angle ψof a global magnetic field as the actuation parameter, demonstrating potential for practical applications. The proposed cascade control approach enables faster and more precise adjustment of the inter-agent distance than a proportional controller, while maintaining smooth transitions and avoiding abrupt changes in the orientation of the magnetic field, making it suitable for real-world implementation. A bibliographic review was conducted to develop the physical model, considering magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and velocities in viscous media. A PID controller was implemented to regulate the radial distance, followed by a PD controller in cascade to smooth changes in field orientation. These controllers were simulated in MATLAB, showing that the PID controller reduced convergence time to the desired radius by about 40%. When adding the second controller, the combined PID+PD scheme achieved smooth angular trajectories within similar timeframes, with fluctuations of only \pm 5^\circ. These results validate the feasibility of controlling the radial distance of two microrobots using a shared magnetic field in a fast and precise manner, without abrupt variations in the control angle. However, the model is limited to a 2D environment and two agents, suggesting future research to extend the controller to 3D systems and multiple agents.

*Peng Chen,Jing Liangb,Kang-Jia Qiao,Hui Song,Cai-Tong Yue,Kun-Jie Yu,Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan,Witold Pedrycz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study presents an innovative scheduling algorithm for multi-trip picking robots in smart orchards, addressing labor shortages and optimization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently schedule multi-robot systems for automated harvesting in smart orchards while solving optimization complexities caused by interdependencies among robot weight, load, and energy consumption.

Method: An adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) is proposed with three innovations: load-distance balancing initialization, clustering-based local search, and experience-based adaptive selection strategy.

Result: AEDGA outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms in experiments involving 42 test instances.

Conclusion: AEDGA is an effective solution for the MTPRTS problem, with enhanced multi-robot scheduling capabilities, overcoming limitations of redundant local operations found in existing algorithms.

Abstract: The continuous innovation of smart robotic technologies is driving the development of smart orchards, significantly enhancing the potential for automated harvesting systems. While multi-robot systems offer promising solutions to address labor shortages and rising costs, the efficient scheduling of these systems presents complex optimization challenges. This research investigates the multi-trip picking robot task scheduling (MTPRTS) problem. The problem is characterized by its provision for robot redeployment while maintaining strict adherence to makespan constraints, and encompasses the interdependencies among robot weight, robot load, and energy consumption, thus introducing substantial computational challenges that demand sophisticated optimization algorithms.To effectively tackle this complexity, metaheuristic approaches, which often utilize local search mechanisms, are widely employed. Despite the critical role of local search in vehicle routing problems, most existing algorithms are hampered by redundant local operations, leading to slower search processes and higher risks of local optima, particularly in large-scale scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive experience-based discrete genetic algorithm (AEDGA) that introduces three key innovations: (1) integrated load-distance balancing initialization method, (2) a clustering-based local search mechanism, and (3) an experience-based adaptive selection strategy. To ensure solution feasibility under makespan constraints, we develop a solution repair strategy implemented through three distinct frameworks. Comprehensive experiments on 18 proposed test instances and 24 existing test problems demonstrate that AEDGA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms.

### [636] [SpeedAug: Policy Acceleration via Tempo-Enriched Policy and RL Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00062)
*Taewook Nam,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpeedAug, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to accelerate robotic policy execution while maintaining task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic policy execution is often slower than hardware capabilities due to the lack of demonstrations for faster execution. Existing approaches fail due to distributional shifts or sample inefficiency in reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose SpeedAug, which uses pre-trained policies on speed-augmented demonstrations to create behavior priors that encompass diverse execution tempos, combined with RL fine-tuning.

Result: The method improves sample efficiency and maintains high success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SpeedAug efficiently addresses policy acceleration by leveraging tempo-enriched behavior priors, achieving both faster execution and high task performance in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotic policy learning have enabled complex manipulation in real-world environments, yet the execution speed of these policies often lags behind hardware capabilities due to the cost of collecting faster demonstrations. Existing works on policy acceleration reinterpret action sequence for unseen execution speed, thereby encountering distributional shifts from the original demonstrations. Reinforcement learning is a promising approach that adapts policies for faster execution without additional demonstration, but its unguided exploration is sample inefficient. We propose SpeedAug, an RL-based policy acceleration framework that efficiently adapts pre-trained policies for faster task execution. SpeedAug constructs behavior prior that encompasses diverse tempos of task execution by pre-training a policy on speed-augmented demonstrations. Empirical results on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that RL fine-tuning initialized from this tempo-enriched policy significantly improves the sample efficiency of existing RL and policy acceleration methods while maintaining high success rate.

*Ohad Bachner,Bar Gamliel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) into symbolic planning for robots, helping them perform tasks more reliably by suggesting commonsense preconditions and subgoals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often fail at tasks because traditional symbolic planners lack the commonsense details (like hidden preconditions or minor subgoals) needed for everyday tasks.

Method: The approach combines a Large Language Model to suggest plausible preconditions and subgoals, then translates them into formal planning models executed in simulations.

Result: The system outperforms a baseline planner without LLM by producing more valid plans, achieving higher success rates, and adapting better to environmental changes.

Conclusion: Adding LLM commonsense to classical symbolic planning enhances reliability, making robot behavior more effective in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Robots often fail at everyday tasks because instructions skip commonsense details like hidden preconditions and small subgoals. Traditional symbolic planners need these details to be written explicitly, which is time consuming and often incomplete. In this project we combine a Large Language Model with symbolic planning. Given a natural language task, the LLM suggests plausible preconditions and subgoals. We translate these suggestions into a formal planning model and execute the resulting plan in simulation. Compared to a baseline planner without the LLM step, our system produces more valid plans, achieves a higher task success rate, and adapts better when the environment changes. These results suggest that adding LLM commonsense to classical planning can make robot behavior in realistic scenarios more reliable.

*Jacob Miske,Ahyan Maya,Ahnaf Inkiad,Jeffrey Ian Lipton*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the development of reconfigurable auxetic lattices for robotic surface manipulation, offering better surface adaptability through variable lattice expansion and reconfigurable locking or servos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many robotic surfaces use traditional materials that lack adaptability for shape manipulation. Auxetic materials, with their negative Poisson's ratio, provide a unique opportunity to create highly conformable and adaptive manipulation interfaces.

Method: The researchers used reconfigurable locking mechanisms and embedded servos to create underactuated auxetic lattice structures. Variable expansion of the lattice was enabled through backlash between unit cells, and experimental data was modeled using an activation function accounting for cell-coupling with backlash.

Result: The experiments verified that reconfigurable auxetic structures achieve variable surface conformity and manipulation. Results aligned well with a simplified system model, showcasing the potential of such structures for adaptive surface manipulation.

Conclusion: Reconfigurable auxetic materials open new possibilities for robotic surface manipulation by enabling compliance through backlash. This innovation improves adaptability and suggests broader applications in robotics.

Abstract: Robotic surfaces traditionally use materials with a positive Poisson's ratio to push and pull on a manipulation interface. Auxetic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio may expand in multiple directions when stretched and enable conformable interfaces. Here we demonstrate reconfigurable auxetic lattices for robotic surface manipulation. Our approach enables shape control through reconfigurable locking or embedded servos that underactuate an auxetic lattice structure. Variable expansion of local lattice areas is enabled by backlash between unit cells. Demonstrations of variable surface conformity are presented with characterization metrics. Experimental results are validated against a simplified model of the system, which uses an activation function to model intercell coupling with backlash. Reconfigurable auxetic structures are shown to achieve manipulation via variable surface contraction and expansion. This structure maintains compliance with backlash in contrast with previous work on auxetics, opening new opportunities in adaptive robotic structures for surface manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces AFRO, a self-supervised 3D pre-training framework that improves robotic manipulation tasks by learning dynamics-aware representations without requiring action or reconstruction supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current 3D visual pre-training methods in robotic manipulation, particularly the lack of dynamics modeling and unnecessary geometric reconstruction.

Method: AFRO employs a self-supervised generative diffusion process for state prediction and models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space. It uses feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision to improve feature learning.

Result: AFRO significantly increases success rates in robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming other pre-training methods on both simulated and real-world tasks, while scaling effectively with data and complexity.

Conclusion: AFRO provides an effective solution for dynamics-aware 3D representation learning, enhancing robotic manipulation and learning semantically rich, discriminative features.

Abstract: Despite strong results on recognition and segmentation, current 3D visual pre-training methods often underperform on robotic manipulation. We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Arcadia, a closed-loop framework for embodied lifelong learning, emphasizing the importance of integrating exploration, simulation, representation, and feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limited generalization and improvement of existing systems in embodied learning by creating a comprehensive lifecycle approach.

Method: Arcadia integrates four stages: autonomous data acquisition, generative scene reconstruction, a shared representation architecture, and simulation-based adaptation into a tightly coupled framework.

Result: Arcadia shows consistent performance improvements in navigation and manipulation benchmarks, and adapts well to physical robots.

Conclusion: Arcadia demonstrates that a closed-loop framework with continuous learning and feedback improves lifelong learning and positions itself as a scalable foundation for embodied agents.

Abstract: We contend that embodied learning is fundamentally a lifecycle problem rather than a single-stage optimization. Systems that optimize only one link (data collection, simulation, learning, or deployment) rarely sustain improvement or generalize beyond narrow settings. We introduce Arcadia, a closed-loop framework that operationalizes embodied lifelong learning by tightly coupling four stages: (1) Self-evolving exploration and grounding for autonomous data acquisition in physical environments, (2) Generative scene reconstruction and augmentation for realistic and extensible scene creation, (3) a Shared embodied representation architecture that unifies navigation and manipulation within a single multimodal backbone, and (4) Sim-from-real evaluation and evolution that closes the feedback loop through simulation-based adaptation. This coupling is non-decomposable: removing any stage breaks the improvement loop and reverts to one-shot training. Arcadia delivers consistent gains on navigation and manipulation benchmarks and transfers robustly to physical robots, indicating that a tightly coupled lifecycle: continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning, supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization. We release standardized interfaces enabling reproducible evaluation and cross-model comparison in reusable environments, positioning Arcadia as a scalable foundation for general-purpose embodied agents.

### [641] [A Hierarchical Framework for Humanoid Locomotion with Supernumerary Limbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00077)
*Bowen Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper developed a hierarchical control design to improve stability in humanoid robots with Supernumerary Limbs (SLs) and demonstrated its effectiveness in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The instability caused by the dynamic perturbations of SLs in humanoid robots necessitated a solution for stable locomotion.

Method: The paper proposed a decoupled hierarchical control system combining learning-based locomotion and model-based balancing to manage SLs.

Result: Testing in physics simulations showed the balancing controller improved stability, decreased DTW distance by 47%, and enhanced gait coordination.

Conclusion: Hierarchical designs can efficiently address the stability challenges of SLs, enabling stable locomotion in humanoid robots.

Abstract: The integration of Supernumerary Limbs (SLs) on humanoid robots poses a significant stability challenge due to the dynamic perturbations they introduce. This thesis addresses this issue by designing a novel hierarchical control architecture to improve humanoid locomotion stability with SLs. The core of this framework is a decoupled strategy that combines learning-based locomotion with model-based balancing. The low-level component consists of a walking gait for a Unitree H1 humanoid through imitation learning and curriculum learning. The high-level component actively utilizes the SLs for dynamic balancing. The effectiveness of the system is evaluated in a physics-based simulation under three conditions: baseline gait for an unladen humanoid (baseline walking), walking with a static SL payload (static payload), and walking with the active dynamic balancing controller (dynamic balancing). Our evaluation shows that the dynamic balancing controller improves stability. Compared to the static payload condition, the balancing strategy yields a gait pattern closer to the baseline and decreases the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of the CoM trajectory by 47\%. The balancing controller also improves the re-stabilization within gait cycles and achieves a more coordinated anti-phase pattern of Ground Reaction Forces (GRF). The results demonstrate that a decoupled, hierarchical design can effectively mitigate the internal dynamic disturbances arising from the mass and movement of the SLs, enabling stable locomotion for humanoids equipped with functional limbs.

TL;DR: Hyper-GoalNet introduces hypernetworks for robotic manipulation, generating task-specific policy parameters directly from goals, improving on state-of-the-art methods in varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to maintain robotic manipulation performance across diverse goals and environments, addressing limitations in conventional fixed-network methods conditioned only on goal-state pairs.

Method: A framework using hypernetworks that decouples goal interpretation (using latent space constraints) and state processing, enabling task-specific policy generation.

Result: Hyper-GoalNet outperforms state-of-the-art in manipulation tasks with environmental randomization, showing robustness in real-world experiments under noise and uncertainties.

Conclusion: The approach achieves superior adaptability and performance in robotic manipulation across diverse tasks and conditions, proving effective both in simulation and real-world settings.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned policy learning for robotic manipulation presents significant challenges in maintaining performance across diverse objectives and environments. We introduce Hyper-GoalNet, a framework that generates task-specific policy network parameters from goal specifications using hypernetworks. Unlike conventional methods that simply condition fixed networks on goal-state pairs, our approach separates goal interpretation from state processing -- the former determines network parameters while the latter applies these parameters to current observations. To enhance representation quality for effective policy generation, we implement two complementary constraints on the latent space: (1) a forward dynamics model that promotes state transition predictability, and (2) a distance-based constraint ensuring monotonic progression toward goal states. We evaluate our method on a comprehensive suite of manipulation tasks with varying environmental randomization. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-variability conditions. Real-world robotic experiments further validate our method's robustness to sensor noise and physical uncertainties. Code is available at: https://github.com/wantingyao/hyper-goalnet.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neck-mounted device for analyzing facial cues to help robots detect human reactions to social errors, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve how robots perceive and respond to subtle human social cues to enhance social competence and integration into human environments.

Method: A neck-mounted device records chin-region facial expressions, and NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model, maps these reactions to facial points and head motion. These reactions are then incorporated into a robot error detection model.

Result: The proposed approach using facial responses from the chin camera outperforms previous methods like OpenFace or standard video data, especially in within-participant datasets.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of untapped facial data for advancing human-in-the-loop robot sensing, promoting better social cue detection and adaptable robotics suited for human interaction.

Abstract: How do humans recognize and rectify social missteps? We achieve social competence by looking around at our peers, decoding subtle cues from bystanders - a raised eyebrow, a laugh - to evaluate the environment and our actions. Robots, however, struggle to perceive and make use of these nuanced reactions. By employing a novel neck-mounted device that records facial expressions from the chin region, we explore the potential of previously untapped data to capture and interpret human responses to robot error. First, we develop NeckNet-18, a 3D facial reconstruction model to map the reactions captured through the chin camera onto facial points and head motion. We then use these facial responses to develop a robot error detection model which outperforms standard methodologies such as using OpenFace or video data, generalizing well especially for within-participant data. Through this work, we argue for expanding human-in-the-loop robot sensing, fostering more seamless integration of robots into diverse human environments, pushing the boundaries of social cue detection and opening new avenues for adaptable robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the limitations of current imitation learning techniques for dexterous hand manipulation, which are hindered by inaccurate motion retargeting, inefficient data collection, and the absence of high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing.

Method: The proposed system, MILE, integrates a mechanically isomorphic design from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand, eliminating nonlinear retargeting. It incorporates anthropometric exoskeletons and robotic hands providing precise, natural control and high-resolution visuotactile modules for detailed tactile data.

Result: MILE achieves precise teleoperation with a mean angular error below one degree, improves success rates by 64% with teleoperation, and shows a 25% increase with tactile data compared to vision-only setups. It enables efficient collection of a multimodal dataset involving tactile and visual signals.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that MILE overcomes significant barriers in dexterous hand manipulation through accurate retargeting-free teleoperation and high-fidelity data integration, enhancing both performance and data quality for imitation learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning provides a promising approach to dexterous hand manipulation, but its effectiveness is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity data. Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations further increases the success rate by an average of 25% over the vision-only baseline, validating the fidelity and utility of the dataset.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Doppler Planning Network (DPNet), a motion planning framework utilizing Doppler LiDARs to efficiently track and react to rapid-motion obstacles with high accuracy and frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion planning methods lack capability to handle rapid-motion obstacles due to insufficient understanding of environmental dynamics.

Method: The paper introduces Doppler Planning Network (DPNet), combining Doppler Kalman network (D-KalmanNet) and Doppler-tuned model predictive control (DT-MPC) within a lightweight framework. D-KalmanNet tracks obstacle states, while DT-MPC adjusts controller parameters for effective motion planning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate DPNet's superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments compared to other benchmarks.

Conclusion: DPNet effectively addresses motion planning limitations by leveraging Doppler LiDARs, enabling fast and accurate planning even in challenging environments with rapidly moving obstacles.

Abstract: Existing motion planning methods often struggle with rapid-motion obstacles due to an insufficient understanding of environmental changes. To address this limitation, we propose integrating motion planners with Doppler LiDARs which provide not only ranging measurements but also instantaneous point velocities. However, this integration is nontrivial due to the dual requirements of high accuracy and high frequency. To this end, we introduce Doppler Planning Network (DPNet), which tracks and reacts to rapid obstacles using Doppler model-based learning. Particularly, we first propose a Doppler Kalman neural network (D-KalmanNet) to track the future states of obstacles under partially observable Gaussian state space model. We then leverage the estimated motions to construct a Doppler-tuned model predictive control (DT-MPC) framework for ego-motion planning, enabling runtime auto-tuning of the controller parameters. These two model-based learners allow DPNet to maintain lightweight while learning fast environmental changes using minimum data, and achieve both high frequency and high accuracy in tracking and planning. Experiments on both high-fidelity simulator and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DPNet over extensive benchmark schemes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the dual challenge of achieving efficiency (minimized total mission cost) and fairness (balanced workload among UAVs) in MUCPP.

Method: An Iterative Exchange Framework is used, which combines iterative task exchanges and path refinements with a composite objective that considers both total mission distance and makespan. Collision-free trajectories are generated using A* search in a terrain-aware configuration space.

Result: The method demonstrated superior trade-offs between total distance and makespan compared to existing baselines in experiments using multiple terrain datasets.

Conclusion: The Iterative Exchange Framework successfully balances efficiency and fairness in MUCPP, providing better performance than traditional approaches.

Abstract: Multi-UAV cooperative path planning (MUCPP) is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, aiming to generate collision-free trajectories for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to complete distributed tasks efficiently. A key challenge lies in achieving both efficiency, by minimizing total mission cost, and fairness, by balancing the workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents. This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. For each UAV, collision-free trajectories are generated using A* search over a terrain-aware configuration space. Comprehensive experiments on multiple terrain datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior trade-offs between total distance and makespan compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential of programmable photonic computing chips in advancing robotic control tasks, enabling real-time, energy-efficient autonomous systems.

Abstract: Robotic continuous control tasks impose stringent demands on the energy efficiency and latency of computing architectures due to their high-dimensional state spaces and real-time interaction requirements. Conventional electronic computing platforms face computational bottlenecks, whereas the fusion of photonic computing and spiking reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. Here, we propose a novel computing architecture based on photonic spiking RL, which integrates the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm with spiking neural network (SNN). The proposed architecture employs an optical-electronic hybrid computing paradigm wherein a silicon photonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) chip executes linear matrix computations, while nonlinear spiking activations are performed in the electronic domain. Experimental validation on the Pendulum-v1 and HalfCheetah-v2 benchmarks demonstrates the system capability for software-hardware co-inference, achieving a control policy reward of 5831 on HalfCheetah-v2, a 23.33% reduction in convergence steps, and an action deviation below 2.2%. Notably, this work represents the first application of a programmable MZI photonic computing chip to robotic continuous control tasks, attaining an energy efficiency of 1.39 TOPS/W and an ultralow computational latency of 120 ps. Such performance underscores the promise of photonic spiking RL for real-time decision-making in autonomous and industrial robotic systems.

### [649] [Sample-Efficient Expert Query Control in Active Imitation Learning via Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00453)
*Arad Firouzkouhi,Omid Mirzaeedodangeh,Lars Lindemann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces CRSAIL, a querying protocol for Active Imitation Learning (AIL) that reduces expert queries by identifying under-represented states using a conformal prediction-based threshold and achieves expert-level performance on robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and inefficiency of expert action labeling in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets revisiting duplicate states.

Method: CRSAIL scores state novelty using distance to the K-th nearest expert state and sets a query threshold through conformal prediction based on empirical quantiles of on-policy calibration scores.

Result: CRSAIL achieves expert-level rewards on MuJoCo robotics tasks, reducing expert queries by up to 96% compared to DAgger and up to 65% compared to prior methods, showing robustness to parameters α and K.

Conclusion: CRSAIL offers an efficient and robust querying strategy for AIL, reducing dependence on expert queries while achieving high performance, and proving suitable for novel systems or unknown dynamics.

Abstract: Active imitation learning (AIL) combats covariate shift by querying an expert during training. However, expert action labeling often dominates the cost, especially in GPU-intensive simulators, human-in-the-loop settings, and robot fleets that revisit near-duplicate states. We present Conformalized Rejection Sampling for Active Imitation Learning (CRSAIL), a querying rule that requests an expert action only when the visited state is under-represented in the expert-labeled dataset. CRSAIL scores state novelty by the distance to the $K$-th nearest expert state and sets a single global threshold via conformal prediction. This threshold is the empirical $(1-α)$ quantile of on-policy calibration scores, providing a distribution-free calibration rule that links $α$ to the expected query rate and makes $α$ a task-agnostic tuning knob. This state-space querying strategy is robust to outliers and, unlike safety-gate-based AIL, can be run without real-time expert takeovers: we roll out full trajectories (episodes) with the learner and only afterward query the expert on a subset of visited states. Evaluated on MuJoCo robotics tasks, CRSAIL matches or exceeds expert-level reward while reducing total expert queries by up to 96% vs. DAgger and up to 65% vs. prior AIL methods, with empirical robustness to $α$ and $K$, easing deployment on novel systems with unknown dynamics.

*Jinhao Zhang,Wenlong Xia,Zhexuan Zhou,Youmin Gong,Jie Mei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LAtent Planner (LAP) addresses diffusion model limitations in autonomous driving with a VAE-learned latent planning space and achieves state-of-the-art performance and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome diffusion model drawbacks such as high latency and focus on low-level kinematics in driving behavior modeling.

Method: LAP utilizes a latent space learning using VAE, integrating high-level intents with low-level kinematics, complemented by fine-grained feature distillation for scene interaction.

Result: LAP shows state-of-the-art closed-loop performance on the nuPlan benchmark and improves computation speed up to 10 times compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: LAP enables rich, multi-modal driving strategies and efficiently reduces computational time without compromising performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities for modeling human-like driving behaviors in autonomous driving, but their iterative sampling process induces substantial latency, and operating directly on raw trajectory points forces the model to spend capacity on low-level kinematics, rather than high-level multi-modal semantics. To address these limitations, we propose LAtent Planner (LAP), a framework that plans in a VAE-learned latent space that disentangles high-level intents from low-level kinematics, enabling our planner to capture rich, multi-modal driving strategies. We further introduce a fine-grained feature distillation mechanism to guide a better interaction and fusion between the high-level semantic planning space and the vectorized scene context. Notably, LAP can produce high-quality plans in one single denoising step, substantially reducing computational overhead. Through extensive evaluations on the large-scale nuPlan benchmark, LAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance among learning-based planning methods, while demonstrating an inference speed-up of at most 10 times over previous SOTA approaches.

### [651] [HAVEN: Hierarchical Adversary-aware Visibility-Enabled Navigation with Cover Utilization using Deep Transformer Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00592)
*Mihir Chauhan,Damon Conover,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical navigation framework for robotics that uses a Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) for subgoal selection and a low-level controller for waypoint execution, addressing challenges like occlusion, safety, and partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of classical path planning and memoryless reinforcement learning in navigating partially observable environments, ensuring safety and efficiency under constraints like limited sensor views and occlusions.

Method: The approach combines a high-level Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) for subgoal selection using temporal memory with a visibility-aware mechanism and a low-level potential field controller for obstacle avoidance. The DTQN processes short history task-aware data to generate Q-values, while the low-level controller executes these subgoals.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated consistent improvements in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal while validating the utility of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design, tested in both 2D simulations and a 3D Unity-ROS environment.

Conclusion: This generalizable hierarchical navigation framework provides a robust solution for safe and efficient navigation under uncertainty, with broad applicability across diverse robotic platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in partially observable environments requires agents to reason beyond immediate sensor input, exploit occlusion, and ensure safety while progressing toward a goal. These challenges arise in many robotics domains, from urban driving and warehouse automation to defense and surveillance. Classical path planning approaches and memoryless reinforcement learning often fail under limited fields of view (FoVs) and occlusions, committing to unsafe or inefficient maneuvers. We propose a hierarchical navigation framework that integrates a Deep Transformer Q-Network (DTQN) as a high-level subgoal selector with a modular low-level controller for waypoint execution. The DTQN consumes short histories of task-aware features, encoding odometry, goal direction, obstacle proximity, and visibility cues, and outputs Q-values to rank candidate subgoals. Visibility-aware candidate generation introduces masking and exposure penalties, rewarding the use of cover and anticipatory safety. A low-level potential field controller then tracks the selected subgoal, ensuring smooth short-horizon obstacle avoidance. We validate our approach in 2D simulation and extend it directly to a 3D Unity-ROS environment by projecting point-cloud perception into the same feature schema, enabling transfer without architectural changes. Results show consistent improvements over classical planners and RL baselines in success rate, safety margins, and time to goal, with ablations confirming the value of temporal memory and visibility-aware candidate design. These findings highlight a generalizable framework for safe navigation under uncertainty, with broad relevance across robotic platforms.

*Anik Sarker,Alan T. Asbeck*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for aligning rotation sets on SO(3) effectively without correspondence, overcoming issues like missing time alignment, outliers, and unknown axis conventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Correctly aligning rotation sets is essential in calibration and registration tasks, but challenges like outliers, axis ambiguity, and time misalignment complicate this process.

Method: The method decomposes each rotation into Transformed Basis Vectors (TBVs) and aligns them using robust matchers. A PASI wrapper handles axis relabeling and sign flips, enabling faster performance with linear complexity.

Result: The proposed approach is 6-60x faster than traditional methods, handles up to 90% outliers, and demonstrates accuracy across multiple datasets without requiring correspondence search.

Conclusion: The presented method offers a fast, robust, and accurate solution for correspondence-free rotation alignment, addressing limitations in conventional techniques.

Abstract: We address the correspondence-free alignment of two rotation sets on \(SO(3)\), a core task in calibration and registration that is often impeded by missing time alignment, outliers, and unknown axis conventions. Our key idea is to decompose each rotation into its \emph{Transformed Basis Vectors} (TBVs)-three unit vectors on \(S^2\)-and align the resulting spherical point sets per axis using fast, robust matchers (SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid). To handle axis relabels and sign flips, we introduce a \emph{Permutation-and-Sign Invariant} (PASI) wrapper that enumerates the 24 proper signed permutations, scores them via summed correlations, and fuses the per-axis estimates into a single rotation by projection/Karcher mean. The overall complexity remains linear in the number of rotations (\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)), contrasting with \(\mathcal{O}(N_r^3\log N_r)\) for spherical/\(SO(3)\) correlation. Experiments on EuRoC Machine Hall simulations
  (axis-consistent) and the ETH Hand-Eye benchmark (\texttt{robot\_arm\_real})
  (axis-ambiguous) show that our methods are accurate, 6-60x faster than traditional methods, and robust under extreme outlier ratios (up to 90\%), all without correspondence search.

TL;DR: The paper presents MS-PPO, a policy learning framework for legged robots, leveraging morphological symmetry and kinematic structures to improve training efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in training and limited generalization of symmetry-agnostic policy architectures for legged robots.

Method: The proposed MS-PPO framework integrates kinematic and symmetry information into the policy through a morphology-informed graph neural architecture that ensures symmetry-equivariance.

Result: MS-PPO demonstrated superior training stability, symmetry generalization, and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various robotic locomotion tasks and deployments.

Conclusion: Embedding kinematic structures and morphological symmetry into policy learning provides a significant inductive bias, improving robotic locomotion control and eliminating the need for reward shaping or data augmentation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently enabled impressive locomotion capabilities on legged robots; however, most policy architectures remain morphology- and symmetry-agnostic, leading to inefficient training and limited generalization. This work introduces MS-PPO, a morphological-symmetry-equivariant policy learning framework that encodes robot kinematic structure and morphological symmetries directly into the policy network. We construct a morphology-informed graph neural architecture that is provably equivariant with respect to the robot's morphological symmetry group actions, ensuring consistent policy responses under symmetric states while maintaining invariance in value estimation. This design eliminates the need for tedious reward shaping or costly data augmentation, which are typically required to enforce symmetry. We evaluate MS-PPO in simulation on Unitree Go2 and Xiaomi CyberDog2 robots across diverse locomotion tasks, including trotting, pronking, slope walking, and bipedal turning, and further deploy the learned policies on hardware. Extensive experiments show that MS-PPO achieves superior training stability, symmetry generalization ability, and sample efficiency in challenging locomotion tasks, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These findings demonstrate that embedding both kinematic structure and morphological symmetry into policy learning provides a powerful inductive bias for legged robot locomotion control.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGAS, a framework for LTL-constrained control using offline, model-free datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robotic systems to achieve complex tasks defined by LTL constraints without requiring accurate dynamics models or online interactions.

Method: SAGAS combines graph-assisted trajectory stitching (using a latent reachability graph) and automata-guided planning (via Büchi automata) to find cost-minimal plans, executed by a subgoal-conditioned policy.

Result: SAGAS successfully synthesizes efficient trajectories for LTL tasks, verified on locomotion domains with fragmented offline data.

Conclusion: SAGAS bridges the gap between fragmented offline data and logical constraints, providing an effective solution for LTL-constrained control in challenging model-free scenarios.

Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) provides a rigorous framework for complex robotic tasks, yet existing methods often rely on accurate dynamics models or expensive online interactions. In this work, we address LTL-constrained control in a challenging offline, model-free setting, utilizing only fixed, task-agnostic datasets of fragmented trajectories. We propose SAGAS, a novel framework combining graph-assisted trajectory stitching with automata-guided planning. First, we construct a latent reachability graph from a learned temporal-distance representation. To bridge the semantic gap, we augment this graph with certified anchor nodes and probabilistic soft labels. We then translate the specification into a Büchi automaton and search the implicit product space to derive a cost-minimal prefix-suffix plan. Finally, a subgoal-conditioned low-level policy is deployed to execute these latent waypoints. Experiments on OGBench locomotion domains demonstrate that SAGAS successfully synthesizes efficient trajectories for diverse LTL tasks, effectively bridging the gap between fragmented offline data and complex logical constraints.

*Nitin Kumar Singh,Arie Rachmad Syulistyo,Yuichiro Tanaka,Hakaru Tamukoh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an efficient sign language recognition (SLR) system utilizing MediaPipe for feature extraction and a bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) architecture. It achieves significant accuracy and reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning-based SLR systems are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. There is a need for an efficient SLR system that benefits edge devices.

Method: The paper employs MediaPipe to extract hand joint coordinates and uses an Echo State Network (ESN) based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) architecture. BRC processes features in both forward and backward directions for temporal dependency, which enhances the classification performance.

Result: The system achieves an accuracy of 57.71% on the WLASL dataset and reduces training time to 9 seconds, compared to 55 minutes and 38 seconds for a Bi-GRU approach.

Conclusion: The proposed BRC-based SLR system is computationally efficient, maintains competitive accuracy, and is suitable for deployment on edge devices due to its low resource requirements.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) facilitates communication between deaf and hearing individuals. Deep learning is widely used to develop SLR-based systems; however, it is computationally intensive and requires substantial computational resources, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. To address this, we propose an efficient sign language recognition system using MediaPipe and an echo state network (ESN)-based bidirectional reservoir computing (BRC) architecture. MediaPipe extracts hand joint coordinates, which serve as inputs to the ESN-based BRC architecture. The BRC processes these features in both forward and backward directions, efficiently capturing temporal dependencies. The resulting states of BRC are concatenated to form a robust representation for classification. We evaluated our method on the Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) video dataset, achieving a competitive accuracy of 57.71% and a significantly lower training time of only 9 seconds, in contrast to the 55 minutes and $38$ seconds required by the deep learning-based Bi-GRU approach. Consequently, the BRC-based SLR system is well-suited for edge devices.

*Nan Sun,Bo Mao,Yongchang Li,Chenxu Wang,Di Guo,Huaping Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces InteractGen, a multi-agent framework leveraging foundation models to overcome limitations in robot intelligence for real-world deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models and vision-language-action policies face challenges in adapting to practical service workflows, lacking proactive collaboration and robustness across settings.

Method: InteractGen decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents managing continuous perception, planning, decision-making, failure handling, and human delegation within a cohesive framework.

Result: InteractGen demonstrated better task success rates, adaptability, and enhanced human-robot collaboration during a three-month open-use study.

Conclusion: A multi-agent approach like InteractGen is more effective for developing autonomous service robots capable of functioning in human-populated environments than scaling standalone models.

Abstract: Foundation models have become central to unifying perception and planning in robotics, yet real-world deployment exposes a mismatch between their monolithic assumption that a single model can handle all cognitive functions and the distributed, dynamic nature of practical service workflows. Vision-language models offer strong semantic understanding but lack embodiment-aware action capabilities while relying on hand-crafted skills. Vision-Language-Action policies enable reactive manipulation but remain brittle across embodiments, weak in geometric grounding, and devoid of proactive collaboration mechanisms. These limitations indicate that scaling a single model alone cannot deliver reliable autonomy for service robots operating in human-populated settings. To address this gap, we present InteractGen, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework that decomposes robot intelligence into specialized agents for continuous perception, dependency-aware planning, decision and verification, failure reflection, and dynamic human delegation, treating foundation models as regulated components within a closed-loop collective. Deployed on a heterogeneous robot team and evaluated in a three-month open-use study, InteractGen improves task success, adaptability, and human-robot collaboration, providing evidence that multi-agent orchestration offers a more feasible path toward socially grounded service autonomy than further scaling standalone models.

TL;DR: A scalable framework is proposed for UAV mission management using a two-stage decomposition of large-scale MDPs, ensuring computational efficiency and provable policy optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable decision-making in UAV missions under complex and uncertain environments, overcoming computational challenges in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

Method: A two-stage decomposition method: (1) dividing global MDPs into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs using domain-specific attributes; (2) solving them independently and recombining through a meta-policy for conflict resolution.

Result: The method achieves significant reduction in computation time, retains mission reliability, and ensures policy optimality, validated by extensive simulations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances MDP scalability for real-time decision-making in complex UAV missions, offering practical applications for fault-tolerant mission execution.

Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and fault-tolerant framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission management in complex and uncertain environments. The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time without sacrificing mission reliability or policy optimality. The proposed framework establishes a practical and robust foundation for scalable decision-making in real-time UAV mission execution.

*Chengjin Du,Federico Bernabei,Zhengyin Du,Sergio Decherchi,Matteo Lo Preti,Lucia Beccai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a soft actuator called SoftMag that combines tactile sensing and actuation while solving sensor signal distortions caused by deformation, enabling non-destructive quality assessment on objects like apricots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many soft robots lack tactile sensing or lose sensing accuracy due to actuator deformation, hindering their ability to handle delicate objects effectively.

Method: The SoftMag actuator integrates sensing and actuation, using a neural network to decouple and correct signal distortion caused by mechanical parasitic effects. The system is tested in various scenarios, including a two-finger gripper setup.

Result: Experiments validate the system’s ability to predict forces, positions, and assess object firmness in real-time. The gripper demonstrates high accuracy in estimating object firmness, with a Pearson correlation (r > 0.8) when tested on apricots.

Conclusion: SoftMag achieves a functional integration of sensing and actuation in soft robotics, enabling accurate, intelligent, and material-aware manipulation, offering significant progress towards advanced soft robotic systems.

Abstract: Soft robots are powerful tools for manipulating delicate objects, yet their adoption is hindered by two gaps: the lack of integrated tactile sensing and sensor signal distortion caused by actuator deformations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing the SoftMag actuator: a magnetic tactile-sensorized soft actuator. Unlike systems relying on attached sensors or treating sensing and actuation separately, SoftMag unifies them through a shared architecture while confronting the mechanical parasitic effect, where deformations corrupt tactile signals. A multiphysics simulation framework models this coupling, and a neural-network-based decoupling strategy removes the parasitic component, restoring sensing fidelity. Experiments including indentation, quasi-static and step actuation, and fatigue tests validate the actuator's performance and decoupling effectiveness. Building upon this foundation, the system is extended into a two-finger SoftMag gripper, where a multi-task neural network enables real-time prediction of tri-axial contact forces and position. Furthermore, a probing-based strategy estimates object firmness during grasping. Validation on apricots shows a strong correlation (Pearson r over 0.8) between gripper-estimated firmness and reference measurements, confirming the system's capability for non-destructive quality assessment. Results demonstrate that combining integrated magnetic sensing, learning-based correction, and real-time inference enables a soft robotic platform that adapts its grasp and quantifies material properties. The framework offers an approach for advancing sensorized soft actuators toward intelligent, material-aware robotics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner (B-CTMP), an algorithm designed for two-step manipulation tasks with provable guarantees for speed and success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic motion planning lacks algorithms that offer verifiable guarantees on safety, efficiency, and reliability, especially for manipulation tasks.

Method: The B-CTMP algorithm extends Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) by handling two-step manipulation tasks through precomputation of compact data structures to enable constant-time query.

Result: The authors evaluate B-CTMP in simulated and robotic environments, demonstrating its ability to consistently handle tasks like shelf picking and plug insertion successfully.

Conclusion: B-CTMP bridges the gap between collision-free motion planning and object manipulation, providing a unified approach with guarantees for speed and reliability in semi-structured settings.

Abstract: Recent progress in contact-rich robotic manipulation has been striking, yet most deployed systems remain confined to simple, scripted routines. One of the key barriers is the lack of motion planning algorithms that can provide verifiable guarantees for safety, efficiency and reliability. To address this, a family of algorithms called Constant-Time Motion Planning (CTMP) was introduced, which leverages a preprocessing phase to enable collision-free motion queries in a fixed, user-specified time budget (e.g., 10 milliseconds). However, existing CTMP methods do not explicitly incorporate the manipulation behaviors essential for object handling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textit{Behavioral Constant-Time Motion Planner} (B-CTMP), an algorithm that extends CTMP to solve a broad class of two-step manipulation tasks: (1) a collision-free motion to a behavior initiation state, followed by (2) execution of a manipulation behavior (such as grasping or insertion) to reach the goal. By precomputing compact data structures, B-CTMP guarantees constant-time query in mere milliseconds while ensuring completeness and successful task execution over a specified set of states. We evaluate B-CTMP on two canonical manipulation tasks in simulation, shelf picking and plug insertion,and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real robot. Our results show that B-CTMP unifies collision-free planning and object manipulation within a single constant-time framework, providing provable guarantees of speed and success for manipulation in semi-structured environments.

Motivation: Existing humanoid robot controllers are highly specific to individual designs, needing complex tuning and limiting transferability across platforms.

Method: H-Zero, a cross-humanoid locomotion pretraining pipeline, learns a general policy that can be transferred to new robot embodiments with little or no additional fine-tuning.

Result: H-Zero achieved zero-shot and few-shot transfer capabilities, retaining up to 81% performance on unseen robots in simulation and enabling adaptation to novel robots within 30 minutes of fine-tuning.

Conclusion: H-Zero demonstrates that pretraining on a limited robot set can generalize locomotion capabilities to novel robots, making robotic development more adaptable and efficient.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of humanoid robotics has intensified the need for robust and adaptable controllers to enable stable and efficient locomotion across diverse platforms. However, developing such controllers remains a significant challenge because existing solutions are tailored to specific robot designs, requiring extensive tuning of reward functions, physical parameters, and training hyperparameters for each embodiment. To address this challenge, we introduce H-Zero, a cross-humanoid locomotion pretraining pipeline that learns a generalizable humanoid base policy. We show that pretraining on a limited set of embodiments enables zero-shot and few-shot transfer to novel humanoid robots with minimal fine-tuning. Evaluations show that the pretrained policy maintains up to 81% of the full episode duration on unseen robots in simulation while enabling few-shot transfer to unseen humanoids and upright quadrupeds within 30 minutes of fine-tuning.

Result: FOM-Nav outperforms existing navigation systems on benchmarks MP3D and HM3D, excels in navigation efficiency (SPL), and demonstrates usability on a real robot.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances exploration and navigation efficiency while tackling challenges of memory retention and semantic understanding in unknown environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Object Goal Navigation problem, where a robot must efficiently find a target object in an unknown environment. Existing implicit memory-based methods struggle with long-term memory retention and planning, while explicit map-based approaches lack rich semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose FOM-Nav, a modular framework that enhances exploration efficiency through Frontier-Object Maps and vision-language models. Our Frontier-Object Maps are built online and jointly encode spatial frontiers and fine-grained object information. Using this representation, a vision-language model performs multimodal scene understanding and high-level goal prediction, which is executed by a low-level planner for efficient trajectory generation. To train FOM-Nav, we automatically construct large-scale navigation datasets from real-world scanned environments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model design and constructed dataset. FOM-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MP3D and HM3D benchmarks, particularly in navigation efficiency metric SPL, and yields promising results on a real robot.

*Adelina Giurea,Stijn Luchie,Dieter Coppens,Jeroen Hoebeke,Eli De Poorter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using ultra-wideband (UWB) radar on mobile robots for infrastructure-free obstacle detection and mapping in scenarios where traditional sensors fail, such as in poor visibility environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current obstacle detection technologies like cameras and LiDAR fail in extreme or vision-impaired conditions (e.g., darkness, smoke). UWB radar provides a resilient alternative for mapping in such environments, especially without the need for anchors, as required by most UWB systems.

Method: The study analyzes UWB radar performance across materials (metal, concrete, plywood) and channels (5 and 9). It presents a 3-step mapping pipeline: (i) target identification via CIR peak detection, (ii) filtering noise using advanced signal properties, and (iii) clustering based on distance and angle estimations.

Result: The approach achieves high precision (82.36%) and recall (89.46%) on UWB channel 9 even for low-reflective materials like plywood, while reducing noise and multipath effects.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of UWB radar for anchor-free, vision-independent mapping, paving the way for future UWB-based SLAM systems in challenging environments.

Abstract: This paper presents an infrastructure-free approach for obstacle detection and environmental mapping using ultra-wideband (UWB) radar mounted on a mobile robotic platform. Traditional sensing modalities such as visual cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) fail in environments with poor visibility due to darkness, smoke, or reflective surfaces. In these visioned-impaired conditions, UWB radar offers a promising alternative. To this end, this work explores the suitability of robot-mounted UWB radar for environmental mapping in dynamic, anchor-free scenarios. The study investigates how different materials (metal, concrete and plywood) and UWB radio channels (5 and 9) influence the Channel Impulse Response (CIR). Furthermore, a processing pipeline is proposed to achieve reliable mapping of detected obstacles, consisting of 3 steps: (i) target identification (based on CIR peak detection), (ii) filtering (based on peak properties, signal-to-noise score, and phase-difference of arrival), and (iii) clustering (based on distance estimation and angle-of-arrival estimation). The proposed approach successfully reduces noise and multipath effects, resulting in an obstacle detection precision of at least 82.36% and a recall of 89.46% on channel 9 even when detecting low-reflective materials such as plywood. This work offers a foundation for further development of UWB-based localisation and mapping (SLAM) systems that do not rely on visual features and, unlike conventional UWB localisation systems, do not require on fixed anchor nodes for triangulation.

*Yi-Lin Wei,Haoran Liao,Yuhao Lin,Pengyue Wang,Zhizhao Liang,Guiliang Liu,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework, CycleManip, for addressing cycle-based manipulation tasks in robotics, along with introducing a benchmark for diverse tasks and automated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in robot manipulation for cyclic or repetitive tasks, which are critical in daily scenarios, but are understudied. Existing methods fail to efficiently complete tasks within expected timelines and lack benchmarks for development and evaluation.

Method: The proposed CycleManip framework employs cost-aware sampling for history perception improvement and multi-task learning for better historical context understanding. It offers an end-to-end imitation solution without relying on additional models or complex structures. Additionally, a benchmark with diverse tasks and automatic evaluation is introduced.

Result: The framework demonstrates high success rates in performing cycle-based tasks in both simulated and real-world environments. It exhibits strong adaptability to general manipulation problems and compatibility with various imitation policies across different robotic platforms.

Conclusion: CycleManip is an effective and adaptable solution for cycle-based robot manipulation, achieving superior performance and broad applicability across tasks, policies, and robotic platforms.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet underexplored task in robot manipulation: cycle-based manipulation, where robots need to perform cyclic or repetitive actions with an expected terminal time. These tasks are crucial in daily life, such as shaking a bottle or knocking a nail. However, few prior works have explored this task, leading to two main challenges: 1) the imitation methods often fail to complete these tasks within the expected terminal time due to the ineffective utilization of history; 2) the absence of a benchmark with sufficient data and automatic evaluation tools hinders development of effective solutions in this area. To address these challenges, we first propose the CycleManip framework to achieve cycle-based task manipulation in an end-to-end imitation manner without requiring any extra models, hierarchical structure or significant computational overhead. The core insight is to enhance effective history perception by a cost-aware sampling strategy and to improve historical understanding by multi-task learning. Second, we introduce a cycle-based task manipulation benchmark, which provides diverse cycle-based tasks, and an automatic evaluation method. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in cycle-based task manipulation. The results further show strong adaptability performance in general manipulation, and the plug-and-play ability on imitation policies such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Moreover, the results show that our approach can be applied across diverse robotic platforms, including bi-arm grippers, dexterous hands, and humanoid robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLASH, an asynchronous inference framework for Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), enabling faster, smoother, and accurate robotic control without sacrificing accuracy or adding overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Vision-Language-Action models in real-world robotic tasks is sluggish and inefficient due to action stalls and delayed environmental reactions. Asynchronous inference could resolve this by simultaneous action execution and inference.

Method: VLASH predicts the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, addressing temporal misalignment issues seen with asynchronous methods.

Result: Experiments show VLASH can achieve up to 2.03x speedup and reduce reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference, maintaining full accuracy and enabling tasks like ping-pong and whack-a-mole.

Conclusion: VLASH improves robotic control efficiency, reaction speed, and precision without extra overhead, making it ideal for fast and precise tasks beyond the capabilities of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

The robot is capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigation, object detection, and grasping using GraspNet. Testing was conducted through real-world scenarios to evaluate navigation, object selection and grasping, and user experience. The results show that the robot can perform tasks accurately and consistently, achieving a grasping success rate of 75 % from 12 trials. Therefore, the system demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the capabilities of quadruped robots as service robots in real-world environments.

Motivation: To enable a robust vision-based humanoid loco-manipulation system capable of handling diverse articulated objects, improving sim-to-real generalizability using simulation data.

Method: The framework uses staged-reset exploration for policy training stabilization, GRPO-based fine-tuning for improved RL consistency, and massive simulation-based randomization to train policies entirely in virtual environments.

Result: The trained policy showed zero-shot success in various real-world tasks, surpassed the efficiency of human teleoperators by up to 31.7%, and demonstrated advanced handling of articulated objects using RGB-based perception without additional curated data.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a milestone in humanoid robotics by demonstrating the ability to generalize sim-to-real performance using simulation alone, paving the way for more scalable robot learning approaches for high-difficulty tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in GPU-accelerated, photorealistic simulation has opened a scalable data-generation path for robot learning, where massive physics and visual randomization allow policies to generalize beyond curated environments. Building on these advances, we develop a teacher-student-bootstrap learning framework for vision-based humanoid loco-manipulation, using articulated-object interaction as a representative high-difficulty benchmark. Our approach introduces a staged-reset exploration strategy that stabilizes long-horizon privileged-policy training, and a GRPO-based fine-tuning procedure that mitigates partial observability and improves closed-loop consistency in sim-to-real RL. Trained entirely on simulation data, the resulting policy achieves robust zero-shot performance across diverse door types and outperforms human teleoperators by up to 31.7% in task completion time under the same whole-body control stack. This represents the first humanoid sim-to-real policy capable of diverse articulated loco-manipulation using pure RGB perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing productivity tools, such as self-help books, apps, and traditional coaching, have limitations in personalization, scalability, and educational value.

Method: The paper presents a SAR delivering time management and prioritization lessons through a chat interface and speech, alongside a personalized monitoring dashboard.

Result: System evaluation with 15 college students showed a high System Usability Score (79.2) and positive feedback for experience and engagement.

Conclusion: SAR-based productivity coaching can overcome current tool limitations and effectively improve college students' productivity with scalability potential.

Abstract: College students often face academic challenges that hamper their productivity and well-being. Although self-help books and productivity apps are popular, they often fall short. Books provide generalized, non-interactive guidance, and apps are not inherently educational and can hinder the development of key organizational skills. Traditional productivity coaching offers personalized support, but is resource-intensive and difficult to scale. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept for a socially assistive robot (SAR) as an educational coach and a potential solution to the limitations of existing productivity tools and coaching approaches. The SAR delivers six different lessons on time management and task prioritization. Users interact via a chat interface, while the SAR responds through speech (with a toggle option). An integrated dashboard monitors progress, mood, engagement, confidence per lesson, and time spent per lesson. It also offers personalized productivity insights to foster reflection and self-awareness. We evaluated the system with 15 college students, achieving a System Usability Score of 79.2 and high ratings for overall experience and engagement. Our findings suggest that SAR-based productivity coaching can offer an effective and scalable solution to improve productivity among college students.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses intercepting fast-moving objects using a robot arm despite sensor noise, proposing a novel tree-like structure for state-time motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intercepting fast-moving objects poses challenges due to time constraints and sensor noise, which affect precision and speed, requiring innovative planning approaches.

Method: The authors introduce a tree-like structure generated using kinodynamic motion primitives in state-time space. It encodes reachability to goals with real-time updates and incorporates a robust RIAE-AKF for tracking and belief updates.

Result: The framework is tested successfully on an industrial 6 DOF robot arm equipped with a stereo camera, validating its effectiveness for interception.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates real-time interception capabilities and robustness against noise, paving the way for efficient planning in tight time constraints scenarios.

Abstract: Intercepting fast moving objects, by its very nature, is challenging because of its tight time constraints. This problem becomes further complicated in the presence of sensor noise because noisy sensors provide, at best, incomplete information, which results in a distribution over target states to be intercepted. Since time is of the essence, to hit the target, the planner must begin directing the interceptor, in this case a robot arm, while still receiving information. We introduce an tree-like structure, which is grown using kinodynamic motion primitives in state-time space. This tree-like structure encodes reachability to multiple goals from a single origin, while enabling real-time value updates as the target belief evolves and seamless transitions between goals. We evaluate our framework on an interception task on a 6 DOF industrial arm (ABB IRB-1600) with an onboard stereo camera (ZED 2i). A robust Innovation-based Adaptive Estimation Adaptive Kalman Filter (RIAE-AKF) is used to track the target and perform belief updates.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a learning method, Asymmetric Advantage Weighted Regression (AAWR), that enables robots to efficiently seek out missing information, enhancing task performance under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often experience partial observability, where sensory data lacks task-critical information. Existing methods in robot learning fail to actively gather missing data, hampering task performance.

Method: The researchers propose AAWR, a learning approach that uses privileged sensors during training to construct value functions, aiding active perception. The method also uses demonstrations and pre-trained coarse policies for bootstrapping.

Result: AAWR outperformed existing approaches in evaluations on eight manipulation tasks across three robots under varying levels of partial observability, generating reliable active perception behaviors.

Conclusion: AAWR efficiently enables robots to perform active perception, boosting their ability to handle tasks under significant partial observability, even when initialized with generalist policies.

Abstract: A robot's instantaneous sensory observations do not always reveal task-relevant state information. Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to "privileged" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a "generalist" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the underexplored area of swarm-based drone tracking, which offers advantages like distributed perception, fault tolerance, and multi-directional target coverage, as opposed to conventional single-drone systems.

Method: The authors propose a system utilizing a Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF) for 3D occlusion representation, algorithms for real-time SSDF updating, and a Field-of-View alignment cost. The system integrates a hierarchical planner combining a kinodynamic front-end and a spatiotemporal optimizer for trajectory planning, enabling collaborative, decentralized operations.

Result: Testing in cluttered outdoor environments confirmed robust cooperative tracking of agile targets, such as drones and humans. The system maintained superior visibility while ensuring safety and multidirectional encirclement.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively leverages the potential of swarm drones for cooperative tracking, making advancements in visibility maintenance, distributed planning, and system resilience in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial tracking with drones offers vast potential for surveillance, cinematography, and industrial inspection applications. While single-drone tracking systems have been extensively studied, swarm-based target tracking remains underexplored, despite its unique advantages of distributed perception, fault-tolerant redundancy, and multidirectional target coverage. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel decentralized LiDAR-based swarm tracking framework that enables visibility-aware, cooperative target tracking in complex environments, while fully harnessing the unique capabilities of swarm systems. To address visibility, we introduce a novel Spherical Signed Distance Field (SSDF)-based metric for 3-D environmental occlusion representation, coupled with an efficient algorithm that enables real-time onboard SSDF updating. A general Field-of-View (FOV) alignment cost supporting heterogeneous LiDAR configurations is proposed for consistent target observation. Swarm coordination is enhanced through cooperative costs that enforce inter-robot safe clearance, prevent mutual occlusions, and notably facilitate 3-D multidirectional target encirclement via a novel electrostatic-potential-inspired distribution metric. These innovations are integrated into a hierarchical planner, combining a kinodynamic front-end searcher with a spatiotemporal $SE(3)$ back-end optimizer to generate collision-free, visibility-optimized trajectories.Deployed on heterogeneous LiDAR swarms, our fully decentralized implementation features collaborative perception, distributed planning, and dynamic swarm reconfigurability. Validated through rigorous real-world experiments in cluttered outdoor environments, the proposed system demonstrates robust cooperative tracking of agile targets (drones, humans) while achieving superior visibility maintenance.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method for training humanoid robots to adopt falling protection strategies using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning, highlighting the ability to reduce damage during falls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots are prone to uncontrolled falls due to their morphology, dynamics, and control limitations, causing serious hardware damage. A robust falling protection mechanism is necessary to address such issues.

Method: The work employs large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning, designed with specific reward functions and domain diversification strategies, to train humanoid agents to learn falling protection behaviors.

Result: Through training, the humanoid agent discovers a protective behavior of forming a 'triangle' structure during falls, significantly reducing damages. Metrics and experiments validate its performance, and the approach is successfully transferred to a real-world platform.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates the potential of leveraging DRL and Curriculum Learning to train humanoid robots for effective falling protection, significantly reducing fall damages and offering a transferable real-world solution.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have received significant research interests and advancements in recent years. Despite many successes, due to their morphology, dynamics and limitation of control policy, humanoid robots are prone to fall as compared to other embodiments like quadruped or wheeled robots. And its large weight, tall Center of Mass, high Degree-of-Freedom would cause serious hardware damages when falling uncontrolled, to both itself and surrounding objects. Existing researches in this field mostly focus on using control based methods that struggle to cater diverse falling scenarios and may introduce unsuitable human prior. On the other hand, large-scale Deep Reinforcement Learning and Curriculum Learning could be employed to incentivize humanoid agent discovering falling protection policy that fits its own nature and property. In this work, with carefully designed reward functions and domain diversification curriculum, we successfully train humanoid agent to explore falling protection behaviors and discover that by forming a `triangle' structure, the falling damages could be significantly reduced with its rigid-material body. With comprehensive metrics and experiments, we quantify its performance with comparison to other methods, visualize its falling behaviors and successfully transfer it to real world platform.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to adapt foundational robot policies to varied humanoid embodiments, addressing challenges related to embodiment diversity and data utility.

Method: A modality-augmented fine-tuning framework using additional sensory inputs (e.g., binary contact signals, depth metrics, multi-modal data) validated on two humanoid embodiments using diverse datasets.

Result: Enhanced success rates in tasks: GR1 embodiment improved from 51% to 63%; the G1 'Pick Apple to Bowl' task achieved a 94% success rate compared to 48% with standard fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Targeted modality augmentation and high-quality data are critical for improving policy performance and transferability in humanoid robots.

Abstract: This paper presents a modality-augmented fine-tuning framework designed to adapt foundation robot policies to diverse humanoid embodiments. We validate our approach across two distinct settings: (i) the GR1 embodiment, utilizing public datasets where we introduce post-processed modalities, including binary contact signals and ZoeDepth-generated metric depth; and (ii) the Unitree G1 embodiment, for which we contribute a novel multi-modal dataset incorporating cuRobo motion planning, inverse kinematics, and ground-truth contact-force measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that modality augmentation consistently enhances policy performance across different embodiments. Specifically, for the GR1, integrating contact-state cues and RGB-D fusion improves online success rates from 51% to 63%. Furthermore, in the G1 "Pick Apple to Bowl" task, our contact-augmented model achieves a success rate of 94%, significantly outperforming the 48% achieved by standard fine-tuning and the 0% baseline of zero-shot transfer. These results highlight that lightweight post-processing effectively strengthens policies for GR1, while high-quality multi-modal data is crucial for reliable transfer to the Unitree G1. Consequently, this work establishes a unified, data-centric pathway for extending foundation robot policies through targeted modality design and multi-modal fine-tuning.

*Jiayi Li,Yuxuan Hu,Haoran Geng,Xiangyu Chen,Chuhao Zhou,Ziteng Cui,Jianfei Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), which enhances robotic manipulation by photometrically re-rendering material properties to improve generalization on diverse materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of robotic manipulation with diverse material properties, especially materials like glass or metal that present out-of-distribution visual and physical variations.

Method: M$^3$A generates a variety of photorealistic demonstrations using light transport and photometric re-rendering from a single real-world demonstration, effectively augmenting data without additional collection.

Result: Experiments show a 58.03% improvement in success rates across three real-world tasks and robustness on unseen materials, validated through a new multi-material manipulation benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach decouples task-specific manipulation from surface appearance, enabling improved material generalization with reduced reliance on extensive real-world data collection.

Abstract: Material generalization is essential for real-world robotic manipulation, where robots must interact with objects exhibiting diverse visual and physical properties. This challenge is particularly pronounced for objects made of glass, metal, or other materials whose transparent or reflective surfaces introduce severe out-of-distribution variations. Existing approaches either rely on simulated materials in simulators and perform sim-to-real transfer, which is hindered by substantial visual domain gaps, or depend on collecting extensive real-world demonstrations, which is costly, time-consuming, and still insufficient to cover various materials. To overcome these limitations, we resort to computational photography and introduce Mutable Material Manipulation Augmentation (M$^3$A), a unified framework that leverages the physical characteristics of materials as captured by light transport for photometric re-rendering. The core idea is simple yet powerful: given a single real-world demonstration, we photometrically re-render the scene to generate a diverse set of highly realistic demonstrations with different material properties. This augmentation effectively decouples task-specific manipulation skills from surface appearance, enabling policies to generalize across materials without additional data collection. To systematically evaluate this capability, we construct the first comprehensive multi-material manipulation benchmark spanning both simulation and real-world environments. Extensive experiments show that the M$^3$A policy significantly enhances cross-material generalization, improving the average success rate across three real-world tasks by 58.03\%, and demonstrating robust performance on previously unseen materials.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NavForesee, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) integrating long-term planning and predictive foresight into embodied navigation for complex natural language instructions, demonstrating strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents struggle with robust long-term planning and handling unseen environments in navigation tasks guided by complex instructions, resulting in high failure rates.

Method: NavForesee combines a Vision-Language Model to perform task decomposition, sub-goal formulation, tracking progress, and predictive world modeling for short-term and long-term navigation foresight.

Result: NavForesee achieves competitive performance on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks for complex navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of unifying explicit language planning with implicit prediction, improving the capability of embodied agents in navigation tasks.

Abstract: Embodied navigation for long-horizon tasks, guided by complex natural language instructions, remains a formidable challenge in artificial intelligence. Existing agents often struggle with robust long-term planning about unseen environments, leading to high failure rates. To address these limitations, we introduce NavForesee, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) that unifies high-level language planning and predictive world model imagination within a single, unified framework. Our approach empowers a single VLM to concurrently perform planning and predictive foresight. Conditioned on the full instruction and historical observations, the model is trained to understand the navigation instructions by decomposing the task, tracking its progress, and formulating the subsequent sub-goal. Simultaneously, it functions as a generative world model, providing crucial foresight by predicting short-term environmental dynamics and long-term navigation milestones. The VLM's structured plan guides its targeted prediction, while the imagined future provides rich context to inform the navigation actions, creating a powerful internal feedback loop of perception-planning/prediction-action. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmark that NavForesee achieves highly competitive performance in complex scenarios. Our work highlights the immense potential of fusing explicit language planning with implicit spatiotemporal prediction, paving the way for more intelligent and capable embodied agents.

*Qiyang Lyu,Wei Wang,Zhenyu Wu,Hongming Shen,Huiqin Zhou,Danwei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents L2M-Calib, a novel calibration method for fusing magnetic sensors and LiDAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic sensors have robust properties for use in challenging conditions but are underused due to the lack of effective calibration techniques.

Method: The method uses iterative Gauss-Newton optimization for extrinsic parameters and weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) for intrinsic calibration.

Result: Evaluations on simulations and real-world data show high precision and robustness.

Conclusion: L2M-Calib enables effective integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems, proving its accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion enables robust environmental perception by leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous sensing modalities. However, accurate calibration is a critical prerequisite for effective fusion. This paper proposes a novel one-key calibration framework named L2M-Calib for a fused magnetic-LiDAR system, jointly estimating the extrinsic transformation between the two kinds of sensors and the intrinsic distortion parameters of the magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors capture ambient magnetic field (AMF) patterns, which are invariant to geometry, texture, illumination, and weather, making them suitable for challenging environments. Nonetheless, the integration of magnetic sensing into multimodal systems remains underexplored due to the absence of effective calibration techniques. To address this, we optimize extrinsic parameters using an iterative Gauss-Newton scheme, coupled with the intrinsic calibration as a weighted ridge-regularized total least squares (w-RRTLS) problem, ensuring robustness against measurement noise and ill-conditioned data. Extensive evaluations on both simulated datasets and real-world experiments, including AGV-mounted sensor configurations, demonstrate that our method achieves high calibration accuracy and robustness under various environmental and operational conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), extending established benchmarks to include metrics for transfer time, energy consumption, and design-specific payload assessment. Experiments validate the efficacy of a lightweight gripper prototype.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks do not evaluate grippers across different robotic platforms or account for energy-aware performance, which is essential for modern applications like mobile and aerial manipulation.

Method: Develop CEGB, a benchmarking suite extending existing metrics, and implement a lightweight, self-locking gripper prototype for validation.

Result: The prototype demonstrates rapid embodiment transfer (~17.6 seconds), low energy consumption (~1.5 J per 10 seconds), and high grasp success rates (>90%) with consistent cycle times.

Conclusion: CEGB provides a reproducible framework for evaluating grippers’ cross-platform transferability and energy efficiency, supporting advancements in aerial and manipulator domains.

Abstract: Robotic grippers are increasingly deployed across industrial, collaborative, and aerial platforms, where each embodiment imposes distinct mechanical, energetic, and operational constraints. Established YCB and NIST benchmarks quantify grasp success, force, or timing on a single platform, but do not evaluate cross-embodiment transferability or energy-aware performance, capabilities essential for modern mobile and aerial manipulation. This letter introduces the Cross-Embodiment Gripper Benchmark (CEGB), a compact and reproducible benchmarking suite extending YCB and selected NIST metrics with three additional components: a transfer-time benchmark measuring the practical effort required to exchange embodiments, an energy-consumption benchmark evaluating grasping and holding efficiency, and an intent-specific ideal payload assessment reflecting design-dependent operational capability. Together, these metrics characterize both grasp performance and the suitability of reusing a single gripper across heterogeneous robotic systems. A lightweight self-locking gripper prototype is implemented as a reference case. Experiments demonstrate rapid embodiment transfer (median ~= 17.6 s across user groups), low holding energy for gripper prototype (~= 1.5 J per 10 s), and consistent grasp performance with cycle times of 3.2 - 3.9 s and success rates exceeding 90%. CEGB thus provides a reproducible foundation for cross-platform, energy-aware evaluation of grippers in aerial and manipulators domains.

Abstract: This work presents a real-time autonomous track navigation framework for nonholonomic differential-drive mobile robots by jointly integrating multi-task visual perception and a provably stable tracking controller. The perception pipeline reconstructs lane centerlines using 2D-to-3D camera projection, arc-length based uniform point resampling, and cubic polynomial fitting solved via robust QR least-squares optimization. The controller regulates robot linear and angular velocities through a Lyapunov-stability grounded design, ensuring bounded error dynamics and asymptotic convergence of position and heading deviations even in dynamic and partially perceived lane scenarios, without relying on HD prior maps or global satellite localization. Real-world experiments on embedded platforms verify system fidelity, real-time execution, trajectory smoothness, and closed-loop stability for reliable autonomous navigation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF) to improve real-time robot obstacle avoidance in unknown, dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation comes from the challenges of synthesizing obstacle motion-aware Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) in real-time for dynamic scenarios.

Method: A novel Gaussian Process-based CBF leveraging logarithmic transformation and obstacle motion integration is proposed for real-time and smooth barrier values responsive to dynamic obstacles.

Result: Simulation results show better obstacle avoidance performance, with higher safety margins, smoother trajectories, and improved responsiveness compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The DLGP-CBF effectively improves safe navigation for robots in dynamic environments, showcasing high adaptability and efficiency through simulation evaluations.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as efficient tools to address the safe navigation problem for robot applications. However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiG-Flow enhances vision-language-action (VLA) model robustness with geometric regularization, improving performance especially under distribution shifts and on multi-step tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models show great potential but struggle under distribution shifts and complex tasks due to insufficient task-relevant semantics in learned representations.

Method: DiG-Flow uses discrepancy measures between observation and action embeddings to calculate modulation weights for residual updates, improving alignment without modifying flow matching mechanisms.

Result: DiG-Flow consistently improves VLA model performance, especially in complex tasks and under limited training data, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Conclusion: Geometric regularization via DiG-Flow offers a principled way to enhance VLA model robustness and efficacy in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of robust, real-world agricultural UAV datasets for SLAM research.

Method: Developed a multi-modal dataset with diverse real-world scenarios, comprehensive sensor data, and calibrations for UAV operations in agriculture.

Result: AgriLiRa4D dataset with high-accuracy measurements and benchmarks for evaluating multi-sensor SLAM algorithms was created and validated.

Conclusion: AgriLiRa4D fills a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, enabling advanced research and improving UAV navigation in challenging agricultural settings.

Abstract: Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes IGen, a framework that converts open-world images into synthetic robot training data, overcoming challenges in large-scale realistic robotics data acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and cost-effective training data for generalist robotic policies, as on-robot data collection is challenging and limited.

Method: IGen transforms open-world images into 3D scene representations, uses vision-language models for task-specific reasoning, creates executable actions in SE(3), and generates temporally coherent observations.

Result: Policies trained using IGen-generated data perform similarly to those trained on real-world data.

Conclusion: IGen demonstrates the potential for scalable and effective robotic policy training using synthetic but realistic data derived from open-world images.

Abstract: The rise of generalist robotic policies has created an exponential demand for large-scale training data. However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing VLA policies, which assume human demonstrations are optimal, even though they often contain noise and suboptimal behavior in highly dexterous manipulation tasks.

Method: GR-RL utilizes a multi-stage pipeline that involves: filtering demonstration trajectories using a robust vision-language-conditioned task progress function, applying morphological symmetry augmentation for improved generalization, and aligning the VLA policy with deployment behaviors using online reinforcement learning with a latent space noise predictor.

Result: GR-RL achieves an 83.3% success rate on autonomously performing the precise task of threading shoelaces through eyelets to lace up a shoe.

Conclusion: The GR-RL framework demonstrates that generalist robot foundation models can be refined into highly reliable specialists capable of complex real-world tasks.

Abstract: We present GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that turns a generalist vision-language-action (VLA) policy into a highly capable specialist for long-horizon dexterous manipulation. Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundations models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.

TL;DR: Generative control policies (GCPs) succeed due to iterative computation, not their multi-modal or complex mapping capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the success factors behind generative control policies in robotics.

Method: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of generative control policies on behavior cloning benchmarks, emphasizing supervised iterative computation with controlled stochasticity.

Result: Iterative computation, supervised intermediate steps, and appropriate stochasticity are key, with lighter models like minimum iterative policies performing comparably or better.

Conclusion: Generative models excel in control due to iterative processes rather than distribution fitting, opening up new design focuses for robotic policies.

Abstract: Generative models, like flows and diffusions, have recently emerged as popular and efficacious policy parameterizations in robotics. There has been much speculation as to the factors underlying their successes, ranging from capturing multi-modal action distribution to expressing more complex behaviors. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular generative control policies (GCPs) on common behavior cloning (BC) benchmarks. We find that GCPs do not owe their success to their ability to capture multi-modality or to express more complex observation-to-action mappings. Instead, we find that their advantage stems from iterative computation, as long as intermediate steps are supervised during training and this supervision is paired with a suitable level of stochasticity. As a validation of our findings, we show that a minimum iterative policy (MIP), a lightweight two-step regression-based policy, essentially matches the performance of flow GCPs, and often outperforms distilled shortcut models. Our results suggest that the distribution-fitting component of GCPs is less salient than commonly believed, and point toward new design spaces focusing solely on control performance.

Method: The authors assess the performance of five open-source pose estimators using a physics-based simulator. They conduct robotic grasping trials guided by image-based pose estimates with both a parallel gripper and an underactuated robotic hand.

Result: Experiments on a subset of the BOP benchmark dataset reveal insights into the accuracy and practicality of existing object pose estimators, filling a gap in prior research.

Conclusion: The study provides important considerations for leveraging RGB-based object pose estimators in robotic applications, particularly grasping tasks, and highlights their current capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: We present a framework for evaluating 6-DoF instance-level object pose estimators, focusing on those that require a single RGB (not RGB-D) image as input. Besides gaining intuition about how accurate these estimators are, we are interested in the degree to which they can serve as the sole perception mechanism for robotic grasping. To assess this, we perform grasping trials in a physics-based simulator, using image-based pose estimates to guide a parallel gripper and an underactuated robotic hand in picking up 3D models of objects. Our experiments on a subset of the BOP (Benchmark for 6D Object Pose Estimation) dataset compare five open-source object pose estimators and provide insights that were missing from the literature.

Motivation: Current Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability methods for safe obstacle avoidance struggle with scalability in environments with many obstacles.

Method: NeuroHJR employs Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that embed system dynamics and safety constraints directly into loss functions, allowing continuous state space modeling without grid discretization.

Result: Simulations show NeuroHJR achieves comparable safety performance to classical methods while significantly reducing computational costs in cluttered scenarios.

Conclusion: NeuroHJR facilitates real-time and scalable reachability-based obstacle avoidance, advancing robotics navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) must navigate safely in cluttered environments while accounting for complex dynamics and environmental uncertainty. Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) offers formal safety guarantees through the computation of forward and backward reachable sets, but its application is hindered by poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles. In this paper, we present a novel framework called NeuroHJR that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the HJR solution for real-time obstacle avoidance. By embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, our method bypasses the need for grid-based discretization and enables efficient estimation of reachable sets in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios, showing that it achieves safety performance comparable to that of classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing the computational cost. This work provides a new step toward real-time, scalable deployment of reachability-based obstacle avoidance in robotics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel deep active inference framework for robots to efficiently perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods often neglect exploration and are ineffective under uncertainty, while deep active inference needs improvements in environmental representation and computational efficiency.

Method: The framework integrates a world model (handling environment dynamics at multiple timescales), an action model (compressing actions using vector quantization), and an abstract world model (predicting slow state transitions, simplifying action selection).

Result: The proposed framework successfully handles object-manipulation tasks in a real-world robot, achieving high success rates and balancing goal-directed and exploratory actions, with reduced computational cost for action selection.

Conclusion: Modeling multiple timescales in dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions are critical for efficient robot control in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.

Result: Guardian achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance on new and existing benchmarks, enhancing task success rates in robotic systems.

Conclusion: The approach provides impactful failure data generation and detection methods that significantly boost robotic manipulation reliability.

Abstract: Robust robotic manipulation requires reliable failure detection and recovery. Although current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their accuracy and generalization are limited by the scarcity of failure data. To address this data gap, we propose an automatic robot failure synthesis approach that procedurally perturbs successful trajectories to generate diverse planning and execution failures. This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks. It also effectively improves task success rates when integrated into a state-of-the-art manipulation system in simulation and real robots, demonstrating the impact of our generated failure data.

*Guillermo Garcia-Cobo,Maximilian Igl,Peter Karkus,Zhejun Zhang,Michael Watson,Yuxiao Chen,Boris Ivanovic,Marco Pavone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoaD is proposed to tackle covariate shift issues in autonomous driving by using closed-loop rollouts with expert guidance. This results in robust policy adaptation without requiring extensive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving policies trained on open-loop behavior cloning suffer from covariate shift, causing compounding errors during deployment. This paper aims to address this issue for improved performance.

Method: The RoaD method uses closed-loop rollouts augmented with expert guidance as training data. These demonstrations enhance adaptation while requiring less data than reinforcement learning and avoiding restrictive assumptions of previous methods.

Result: RoaD demonstrates effectiveness on two key benchmarks. It matches or outperforms prior methods on WOSAC and improves driving score by 41% and reduces collisions by 54% on AlpaSim.

Conclusion: RoaD provides a simple and efficient way to mitigate covariate shift in autonomous driving, achieving robust performance in diverse application domains with significantly less data.

Abstract: Autonomous driving policies are typically trained via open-loop behavior cloning of human demonstrations. However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\% and reduces collisions by 54\%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new approach using off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, FastSAC and FastTD3, to achieve rapid training of humanoid robot locomotion policies in just 15 minutes using a single RTX 4090 GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods struggle to achieve fast, reliable sim-to-real humanoid locomotion control due to challenges like high dimensionality and domain randomization.

Method: The approach employs off-policy RL algorithms (FastSAC and FastTD3), using thousands of parallel environments, minimalist reward functions, and carefully tuned design choices to stabilize training at scale.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated effective and rapid learning of locomotion policies and motion tracking for humanoid robots like Unitree G1 and Booster T1 under dynamic and challenging settings including randomized dynamics and rough terrains.

Conclusion: This work enables practical and accelerated training for humanoid locomotion policies, with potential impact in robotic learning applications. Open-source code and videos are provided for replication.

Abstract: Massively parallel simulation has reduced reinforcement learning (RL) training time for robots from days to minutes. However, achieving fast and reliable sim-to-real RL for humanoid control remains difficult due to the challenges introduced by factors such as high dimensionality and domain randomization. In this work, we introduce a simple and practical recipe based on off-policy RL algorithms, i.e., FastSAC and FastTD3, that enables rapid training of humanoid locomotion policies in just 15 minutes with a single RTX 4090 GPU. Our simple recipe stabilizes off-policy RL algorithms at massive scale with thousands of parallel environments through carefully tuned design choices and minimalist reward functions. We demonstrate rapid end-to-end learning of humanoid locomotion controllers on Unitree G1 and Booster T1 robots under strong domain randomization, e.g., randomized dynamics, rough terrain, and push perturbations, as well as fast training of whole-body human-motion tracking policies.

*Wenhao Wang,Yanyan Li,Long Jiao,Jiawei Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes using LLMs for static simulation of robot operation codes, avoiding the need for physical or dynamic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of corrective designs that rely on resource-intensive physical experiments or customized simulation environments for robot operation code validation.

Method: The authors designed a static simulator using LLMs to interpret actions, reason state transitions, and simulate robot operation codes. The framework generates observations capturing trajectory dynamics without physical execution.

Result: The framework demonstrated high accuracy and reliability in simulating robot operations and code generation across various tasks, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-driven corrective framework is effective for generating reliable robot operation codes without requiring physical experiments or specialized simulation environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their promising capabilities of generating robot operation code to enable LLM-driven robots. To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating se- mantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a sim-to-real framework called ours that improves dexterous manipulation tasks such as nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving by incorporating reinforcement learning, teleoperation demonstrations, and tactile sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current limitations in simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals hinder progress in dexterous manipulation research.

Method: The framework involves three stages: training reinforcement learning policies in simulation, using these policies for teleoperated real-world demonstration collection, and behavior cloning using tactile and proprioceptive sensing.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework's high task success ratios and robust performance on diverse objects and under external perturbations.

Conclusion: By overcoming simulation limitations and integrating tactile sensing, ours significantly improves sim-to-real transfer for dexterous manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer have made significant progress in dexterous manipulation. However, progress remains limited by the difficulty of simulating complex contact dynamics and multisensory signals, especially tactile feedback. In this work, we propose \ours, a sim-to-real framework that addresses these limitations and demonstrates its effectiveness on nut-bolt fastening and screwdriving with multi-fingered hands. The framework has three stages. First, we train reinforcement learning policies in simulation using simplified object models that lead to the emergence of correct finger gaits. We then use the learned policy as a skill primitive within a teleoperation system to collect real-world demonstrations that contain tactile and proprioceptive information. Finally, we train a behavior cloning policy that incorporates tactile sensing and show that it generalizes to nuts and screwdrivers with diverse geometries. Experiments across both tasks show high task progress ratios compared to direct sim-to-real transfer and robust performance even on unseen object shapes and under external perturbations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces ManualVLA, a Vision-Language-Action model capable of transforming goal states into executable procedures for tasks like LEGO assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges faced by Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in handling long-horizon tasks requiring coordination of planning and manipulation.

Method: Develop a unified VLA framework, ManualVLA, using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, intermediate multimodal manuals, and a planning expert to enhance task precision.

Result: ManualVLA achieves a 32% higher success rate compared to the previous hierarchical state-of-the-art model in LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.

Conclusion: ManualVLA improves robotic scene understanding and manipulation by effectively bridging high-level planning and precise execution.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.

TL;DR: EfficientFlow is a unified framework for flow-based policy learning in embodied AI, enhancing both data and sampling efficiency for visuomotor tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative policies are data-inefficient and slow in action generation for visuomotor policy learning.

Method: EfficientFlow introduces equivariance into flow matching for better generalization and less data usage, and proposes acceleration regularization for faster sampling.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates competitive or superior performance under limited data with faster inference across various robotic tasks.

Conclusion: EfficientFlow establishes itself as an effective and efficient methodology for high-performance embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: Generative modeling has recently shown remarkable promise for visuomotor policy learning, enabling flexible and expressive control across diverse embodied AI tasks. However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.

*Shailja Thakur,Vaibhav Saxena,Rohan Kulkarni,Shivdeep Singh,Parameswaran Selvam,Hima Patel,Hiroshi Kanayama*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents an approach to improve reasoning in language models for code by grounding Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation directly in program execution traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of teaching language models logical reasoning for code execution and overcome the issue of plausible but flawed reasoning patterns generated by teacher models.

Method: Code is instrumented to capture its dynamic behavior, and verified execution traces are narrated into natural language rationales. These rationales are correct by construction, reflecting the genuine computations of the program.

Result: Models trained on bidirectional trace-grounded data show substantial performance enhancements on reasoning tasks, with up to 30 and 28 point improvements in output and input prediction, respectively. Explanation and code generation capabilities also improved.

Conclusion: Execution-trace-grounded reasoning eliminates logical hallucinations, substantially boosting model accuracy and enhancing reasoning capabilities for code-related tasks.

Abstract: Teaching language models to reason about code execution remains a fundamental challenge. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, current synthetic training data suffers from a critical weakness: the reasoning steps are often plausible-sounding explanations generated by teacher models, not verifiable accounts of what the code actually does. This creates a troubling failure mode where models learn to mimic superficially convincing but logically flawed reasoning patterns.
  We address this by grounding CoT generation directly in program execution traces. Our pipeline instruments code to capture its dynamic behavior, then narrates these verified execution traces into natural language rationales that are correct by construction. This execution-grounded approach ensures every reasoning step reflects what the program genuinely computes, eliminating logical hallucinations at the source. We evaluate our method on code reasoning tasks (forward reasoning on CruxEval and LiveCodeBench-Exec, backward reasoning on CruxEval-Input), as well as code generation and explanation tasks from HumanEval. Models trained on our bi-directional trace-grounded data achieve substantial improvements, with gains of up to 30 points on output prediction and 28 points on input prediction over base models, alongside improved explanation and code generation, demonstrating that verifiable reasoning fundamentally enhances model capabilities. https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Research-AI/Verified-Code-CoT

Motivation: Benchmarking large language models for assembly-to-source code translation is essential for their application in reverse engineering, cybersecurity, and software maintenance.

Method: Evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models across diverse metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, Perplexity, and time prediction, paired with qualitative analysis of successes and failures.

Result: Models show trade-offs between text similarity, fluency, and efficiency, with challenges in control flow recovery and identifier reconstruction emphasized.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing models, offering a foundation for improving program translation accuracy and efficiency in practical applications.

Abstract: Assembly-to-source code translation is a critical task in reverse engineering, cybersecurity, and software maintenance, yet systematic benchmarks for evaluating large language models on this problem remain scarce. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art large language models on assembly-to-source translation. We assess model performance using a diverse set of metrics capturing lexical similarity (BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR), semantic alignment (BERTScore), fluency (Perplexity), and efficiency (time prediction). Our results reveal clear trade-offs: while certain models excel in text similarity metrics, others demonstrate lower perplexity or faster inference times. We further provide qualitative analyses of typical model successes and failure cases, highlighting challenges such as control flow recovery and identifier reconstruction. Taken together, our benchmark offers actionable insights into the strengths and limitations of current large language models for program translation, establishing a foundation for future research in combining accuracy with efficiency for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reasoning behavior of large language models in runtime code execution, analyzing their trace structures and errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the reasoning traces of LLMs, as prior studies primarily focused on output accuracy without exploring the underlying reasoning processes.

Method: Conducted an empirical study on LLM reasoning behaviors using a 427-code snippet benchmark with three input types (regular, edge, invalid) across four state-of-the-art LLMs. Developed a taxonomy of reasoning errors by analyzing traces and incorporated tool-augmented reasoning for error correction.

Result: LLMs achieved 85-98% accuracy across input types. A taxonomy of nine error categories was developed, and tool-augmented reasoning corrected 58% of certain reasoning errors.

Conclusion: LLMs display strong output accuracy but produce diverse reasoning errors. Tool-augmented approaches can improve reasoning accuracy, showcasing potential for refining LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding a program's runtime reasoning behavior, meaning how intermediate states and control flows lead to final execution results, is essential for reliable code generation, debugging, and automated reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict program outputs, most prior work has focused on output accuracy and performance, treating reasoning as a black box. As a result, little is known about the structure or failure modes of their reasoning traces. To address this gap, we conduct the first empirical study on runtime behavior inference with reasoning LLMs, aiming to uncover and characterize errors in their reasoning traces. We curate a benchmark from HumanEval Plus and LiveCodeBench, containing 427 code snippets. For each snippet, we test three input types: regular, edge, and invalid. Twelve input values are selected per snippet, each paired with its ground-truth execution result. We evaluate four state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs. Our results show that these models reach accuracies between 85 percent and 98 percent across input types. We also analyze the produced reasoning traces and develop a taxonomy with nine categories of inference errors. Finally, we explore tool-augmented reasoning. Using failures in the Computation Errors category as a case study, our experiments show that this approach corrects 58 percent of such errors, demonstrating the potential of tool support for improving LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the accuracy challenges of Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) methods, particularly for new software projects differing from historical data, and to develop a reliable estimation method.

Method: The study integrates the Firefly Algorithm (FA) with Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) and employs feature selection to improve prediction accuracy. Evaluations were conducted on five public datasets using error metrics such as MMRE, MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

Result: The FAABE model demonstrated significant improvement in prediction precision across multiple datasets, outperforming traditional estimation methods.

Conclusion: The Firefly-Analogy ensemble model shows enhanced accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising approach for reliable software project estimation.

Abstract: Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) is a popular method for non-algorithmic estimation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The Analogy-Based Estimation (ABE) model was proposed by researchers, however, no optimal approach for reliable estimation was developed. Achieving high accuracy in the ABE might be challenging for new software projects that differ from previous initiatives. This study (conducted in June 2024) proposes a Firefly Algorithm-guided Analogy-Based Estimation (FAABE) model that combines FA with ABE to improve estimation accuracy. The FAABE model was tested on five publicly accessible datasets: Cocomo81, Desharnais, China, Albrecht, Kemerer and Maxwell. To improve prediction efficiency, feature selection was used. The results were measured using a variety of evaluation metrics; various error measures include MMRE, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Compared to conventional models, the experimental results show notable increases in prediction precision, demonstrating the efficacy of the Firefly-Analogy ensemble.

TL;DR: CodeFlowLM introduces an incremental learning framework for JIT-SDP using pre-trained language models, showing significant improvements in adaptability and robustness. Explorations into LLMs for JIT-DL reveal both potential and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in traditional online learners for software defect prediction by leveraging PLMs for addressing issues like concept drift, class imbalance, and verification latency.

Method: Introduced continual fine-tuning in CodeFlowLM for JIT-SDP; evaluated encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs, and benchmarked various LLMs for JIT defect localization compared to attention-based methods.

Result: CodeFlowLM achieved up to 68% G-Mean gains in JIT-SDP. GPT-5, among LLMs, performed well in JIT-DL for recall metrics but lagged in fine-grained ranking metrics compared to attention-based models.

Conclusion: CodeFlowLM marks a significant advancement in incremental JIT-SDP, with strong adaptability and robustness. Exploratory LLM analysis shows promising but limited capabilities in defect localization.

Abstract: This work introduces CodeFlowLM, an incremental learning framework for Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP) that leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs). Unlike traditional online learners, CodeFlowLM employs continual fine-tuning to address concept drift, class imbalance, and verification latency without retraining from scratch. We evaluated encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs (notably CodeT5+ and UniXCoder) in JIT-SDP scenarios within and between projects, comparing them with the incremental baseline BORB. The results show that CodeFlowLM achieves up to 68% G-Mean gains, confirming its superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. We further extend the analysis to Just-in-Time Defect Localization (JIT-DL), benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro against attention-based models. GPT-5 delivers comparable performance for Recall@20% and Effort@20% with higher stability, although attention-based methods retain an advantage in fine-grained ranking metrics (Top-k, IFA). A qualitative error analysis reveals that most false positives arise from (1) human-like conservative bias, (2) insufficient contextual information in diff-based prompts, and (3) potential dataset mislabeling in JIT-Defects4J. These findings highlight both the promise and the current limitations of LLM reasoning in defect localization. False negatives occur in smaller proportions. Overall, CodeFlowLM significantly advances the state of the art in incremental JIT-SDP, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness in evolving software environments. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis of LLMs in JIT-DL not only benchmarks their performance against established attention-based models but also provides critical insights into the current limitations of prompt-based defect reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper discusses ng-reactive-lint, a static analysis tool for optimizing Angular applications by identifying and fixing reactivity-related performance anti-patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address performance regressions in Angular applications caused by misuse of Observables, Signals, and change-detection, which are common due to reliance on legacy RxJS patterns.

Method: The authors developed ng-reactive-lint, a static analysis tool specific to Angular's reactivity framework, enabling framework-aware analysis and actionable fixes.

Result: Evaluation on five large projects showed up to threefold reductions in unnecessary change detection cycles and up to 75% lower peak memory usage.

Conclusion: ng-reactive-lint offers a scalable and automated solution for transitioning to modern Angular reactivity, improving software performance.

Abstract: Reactivity is central to Angular applications, yet subtle misuse of Observables, Signals, and change-detection often leads to performance regressions that are difficult to diagnose. Although Angular 17 introduced a unified, signal-first model, most enterprise codebases still rely heavily on legacy RxJS patterns that create unpredictable update flows, memory leaks, and excessive change cycles. To address these issues, we developed ng-reactive-lint, a deterministic static analysis tool that understands Angular's component semantics, lifecycle hooks, template bindings, and reactivity patterns. Unlike generic ESLint or RxJS plugins, ng-reactive-lint performs framework-aware analysis to detect high-impact anti-patterns and provide actionable, context-specific fixes. Evaluation across five large real-world projects showed reductions of up to threefold in unnecessary change detection cycles and up to 75% lower peak memory usage. The tool offers a practical, automated path to adopting modern Angular reactivity at scale.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework that integrates textual and code snippet information for better LLM-based bug report summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face challenges in understanding verbose and unstructured bug reports, partly due to incomplete summaries and ignored code snippets in traditional methods.

Method: A progressive code-integration framework is introduced, allowing long code snippets to be included incrementally alongside text, overcoming LLM context limitations.

Result: Across four datasets and eight LLMs, the proposed method outperforms extractive methods by 7.5–58.2% and matches state-of-the-art abstractive approaches.

Conclusion: Jointly utilizing textual and code information significantly improves bug report summarization and enhances developer comprehension.

Abstract: Bug reports are often unstructured and verbose, making it challenging for developers to efficiently comprehend software issues. Existing summarization approaches typically rely on surface-level textual cues, resulting in incomplete or redundant summaries, and they frequently ignore associated code snippets, which are essential for accurate defect diagnosis. To address these limitations, we propose a progressive code-integration framework for LLM-based abstractive bug report summarization. Our approach incrementally incorporates long code snippets alongside textual content, overcoming standard LLM context window constraints and producing semantically rich summaries. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets using eight LLMs, our pipeline outperforms extractive baselines by 7.5%-58.2% and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art abstractive methods, highlighting the benefits of jointly leveraging textual and code information for enhanced bug comprehension.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APIKG4SYN improves code generation in low-resource frameworks like HarmonyOS by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with API knowledge graphs, significantly enhancing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with code generation in low-resource frameworks like HarmonyOS due to limited exposure to their APIs and syntax during pre-training.

Method: APIKG4SYN uses API knowledge graphs to produce API-oriented question-code pairs, including single- and multi-API knowledge derived via UE-driven MCTS. This data was used to fine-tune LLMs.

Result: Using HarmonyOS, experiments show fine-tuning with APIKG4SYN increased pass@1 accuracy from 17.59% to 25.00%, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: API-oriented fine-tuning using APIKG4SYN substantially improves LLM effectiveness in generating code for low-resource frameworks.

Abstract: In the context of software frameworks with limited resources (such as HarmonyOS), large language models (LLMs) often exhibit poor code generation performance because they lack sufficient exposure to such environments during pre-training. Although LLMs can usually maintain correct logical structures across programming languages, they frequently struggle when dealing with framework-specific APIs or syntax, resulting in errors. This indicates that while pre-training equips LLMs with general algorithmic capabilities, they remain unfamiliar with the distinctive syntax and API usage of underrepresented frameworks. As a result, even advanced commercial models like GPT-4o cannot reliably generate correct code without prior adaptation. To address this issue, we propose APIKG4SYN, a framework designed to exploit API knowledge graphs for the construction of API-oriented question-code pairs, specifically tailored for low-resource frameworks without requiring executable code. APIKG4SYN integrates both single-API and multi-API knowledge, where the latter is derived through uncertainty estimation (UE)-driven Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), enabling the creation of a diverse and informative dataset for fine-tuning LLMs. Using HarmonyOS as a case study, we build the first benchmark for HarmonyOS code generation. Experimental results show that fine-tuning Qwen with APIKG4SYN raises pass@1 accuracy to 25.00%, compared with 17.59% for the baseline GPT model. These results confirm that API-oriented data significantly enhance LLM performance in low-resource software development scenarios.

### [709] [Bias Testing and Mitigation in Black Box LLMs using Metamorphic Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00556)
*Sina Salimian,Gias Uddin,Sumon Biswas,Henry Leung*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses hidden biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing metamorphic relations (MRs) to detect and mitigate biases. Tests reveal up to 14% more biases, and fine-tuning using MRs improves safe response rates significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising deployment of LLMs has highlighted concerns about subtle social biases in their outputs, particularly when existing safeguards fail against indirect or complex prompts.

Method: The authors introduced six novel metamorphic relations (MRs) that transform prompts into adversarial variants, uncovering biases through inconsistencies in LLM responses. These MRs also serve to generate data for fine-tuning, improving bias moderation.

Result: Using six leading LLMs and 385 BiasAsker benchmark questions, the MRs detected up to 14% more hidden biases than existing methods. Fine-tuning with MR-derived samples increased safe response rates from 54.7% to over 88.9%.

Conclusion: Metamorphic relations prove to be a practical and effective approach for both detecting and mitigating hidden biases in conversational AI.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about subtle social biases embedded in their outputs. Existing guardrails often fail when faced with indirect or contextually complex bias-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for both systematic bias evaluation and targeted mitigation. Our approach introduces six novel Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that, based on metamorphic testing principles, transform direct bias-inducing inputs into semantically equivalent yet adversarially challenging variants. These transformations enable an automated method for exposing hidden model biases: when an LLM responds inconsistently or unfairly across MR-generated variants, the underlying bias becomes detectable. We further show that the same MRs can be used to generate diverse bias-inducing samples for fine-tuning, directly linking the testing process to mitigation. Using six state-of-the-art LLMs - spanning open-source and proprietary models - and a representative subset of 385 questions from the 8,978-item BiasAsker benchmark covering seven protected groups, our MRs reveal up to 14% more hidden biases compared to existing tools. Moreover, fine-tuning with both original and MR-mutated samples significantly enhances bias resiliency, increasing safe response rates from 54.7% to over 88.9% across models. These results highlight metamorphic relations as a practical mechanism for improving fairness in conversational AI.

### [710] [SAGE: Semantic-Aware Gray-Box Game Regression Testing with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00560)
*Jinyu Cai,Jialong Li,Nianyu Li,Zhenyu Mao,Mingyue Zhang,Kenji Tei*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SAGE is a new framework for improving regression testing in gray-box game environments like Overcooked Plus and Minecraft, using LLMs and semantic approaches to handle test generation, optimization, and prioritization, delivering better bug detection with lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the limitations in regression testing for gray-box games, such as reliance on manual effort, inefficiency in test maintenance, and difficulties in test prioritization, which lead to high costs and suboptimal bug detection.

Method: SAGE uses large language model (LLM)-guided reinforcement learning for test generation, semantic-based optimization for refining test cases, and semantic log analysis to prioritize relevant tests for version updates.

Result: SAGE consistently outperforms existing automated and human-recorded test methods in identifying bugs and operates at a lower execution cost, showing strong adaptability to game updates.

Conclusion: SAGE provides an efficient, automated, and adaptive solution to regression testing challenges in gray-box game environments, improving testing efficiency, bug detection, and cost-management.

Abstract: The rapid iteration cycles of modern live-service games make regression testing indispensable for maintaining quality and stability. However, existing regression testing approaches face critical limitations, especially in common gray-box settings where full source code access is unavailable: they heavily rely on manual effort for test case construction, struggle to maintain growing suites plagued by redundancy, and lack efficient mechanisms for prioritizing relevant tests. These challenges result in excessive testing costs, limited automation, and insufficient bug detection. To address these issues, we propose SAGE, a semanticaware regression testing framework for gray-box game environments. SAGE systematically addresses the core challenges of test generation, maintenance, and selection. It employs LLM-guided reinforcement learning for efficient, goal-oriented exploration to automatically generate a diverse foundational test suite. Subsequently, it applies a semantic-based multi-objective optimization to refine this suite into a compact, high-value subset by balancing cost, coverage, and rarity. Finally, it leverages LLM-based semantic analysis of update logs to prioritize test cases most relevant to version changes, enabling efficient adaptation across iterations. We evaluate SAGE on two representative environments, Overcooked Plus and Minecraft, comparing against both automated baselines and human-recorded test cases. Across all environments, SAGE achieves superior bug detection with significantly lower execution cost, while demonstrating strong adaptability to version updates.

### [711] [Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Reproducibility Crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00651)
*Mohammed Latif Siddiq,Arvin Islam-Gomes,Natalie Sekerak,Joanna C. S. Santos*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies reproducibility practices in software engineering research using large language models, analyzing 640 papers to identify challenges and proposing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility is vital for scientific progress but is poorly understood in LLM-based software engineering research.

Method: The study systematically analyzed 640 papers using a taxonomy of reproducibility smells and manual annotation, guided by four research questions.

Result: Findings indicate persistent reproducibility issues in areas such as artifact availability, environment specification, and documentation, while badges lack consistency in demonstrating reproducibility.

Conclusion: The paper recommends actionable solutions and introduces a Reproducibility Maturity Model to enhance reproducibility and move beyond binary artifact certifications.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet its state in large language model (LLM)-based software engineering (SE) research remains poorly understood. This paper presents the first large-scale, empirical study of reproducibility practices in LLM-for-SE research. We systematically mined and analyzed 640 papers published between 2017 and 2025 across premier software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing venues, extracting structured metadata from publications, repositories, and documentation. Guided by four research questions, we examine (i) the prevalence of reproducibility smells, (ii) how reproducibility has evolved over time, (iii) whether artifact evaluation badges reliably reflect reproducibility quality, and (iv) how publication venues influence transparency practices. Using a taxonomy of seven smell categories: Code and Execution, Data, Documentation, Environment and Tooling, Versioning, Model, and Access and Legal, we manually annotated all papers and associated artifacts. Our analysis reveals persistent gaps in artifact availability, environment specification, versioning rigor, and documentation clarity, despite modest improvements in recent years and increased adoption of artifact evaluation processes at top SE venues. Notably, we find that badges often signal artifact presence but do not consistently guarantee execution fidelity or long-term reproducibility. Motivated by these findings, we provide actionable recommendations to mitigate reproducibility smells and introduce a Reproducibility Maturity Model (RMM) to move beyond binary artifact certification toward multi-dimensional, progressive evaluation of reproducibility rigor.

*Zenghui Zhou,Yuechen Li,Yi Cai,Jinlong Wen,Xiaohan Yu,Zheng Zheng,Beibei Yin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CC4Q, the first dataset for code comments in quantum computing, analyzing it to provide insights into quantum software development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges programmers face in understanding quantum software due to the complexities of quantum mechanics and the lack of research on systematic guidelines for effective code comments in quantum software development.

Method: The authors created CC4Q, a dataset of 9677 code comment pairs and 21970 sentence-level comment units, validated existing developer-intent taxonomy, and proposed a new taxonomy for quantum-specific knowledge. They analyzed this data from structural, intentional, and quantum-topic perspectives.

Result: The study found considerable differences between code comments in classical and quantum software, highlighting the need for quantum-specific guidance and knowledge for effective quantum software development.

Conclusion: The findings underline the necessity of tailored documentation practices in quantum computing and provide valuable insights to improve understanding and maintenance of quantum software through enriched code comments.

Abstract: Quantum computing is gaining attention from academia and industry. With the quantum Software Development Kits (SDKs), programmers can develop quantum software to explore the power of quantum computing. However, programmers may face challenges in understanding quantum software due to the non-intuitive quantum mechanics. To facilitate software development and maintenance, code comments offered in quantum SDKs serve as a natural language explanation of program functionalities and logical flows. Despite their importance, scarce research systematically reports their value and provides constructive guidelines for programmers. To address this gap, our paper focuses on Qiskit, one of the most popular quantum SDKs, and presents CC4Q, the first dataset of code comments for quantum computing. CC4Q incorporates 9677 code comment pairs and 21970 sentence-level code comment units, the latter of which involve heavy human annotation. Regarding the annotation, we validate the applicability of the developer-intent taxonomy used in classical programs, and also propose a new taxonomy considering quantum-specific knowledge. We conduct an empirical study comprehensively interpreting code comments from three perspectives: comment structure and coverage, developers' intentions, and associated quantum topics. Our findings uncover key differences in code comments between classical and quantum software, and also outline quantum-specific knowledge relevant to quantum software development.

### [713] [FC-ADL: Efficient Microservice Anomaly Detection and Localisation Through Functional Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00844)
*Giles Winchester,George Parisis,Luc Berthouze*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents FC-ADL, a scalable approach for anomaly detection and localisation in microservices using time-varying dependencies, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to overcome challenges in anomaly detection and localisation in complex, dynamic microservice architectures, addressing limitations of prior methods that either exclude time-varying interdependencies or do not scale well.

Method: The authors propose FC-ADL, which leverages the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity to efficiently detect and localize anomalies by analyzing time-varying dependencies between microservice metrics.

Result: The method successfully achieves high anomaly detection and localization performance across various scenarios and demonstrates strong scalability in a large-scale real-world deployment at Alibaba.

Conclusion: FC-ADL offers a novel and practical solution for addressing operational complexities in microservices, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, thus advancing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Microservices have transformed software architecture through the creation of modular and independent services. However, they introduce operational complexities in service integration and system management that makes swift and accurate anomaly detection and localisation challenging. Despite the complex, dynamic, and interconnected nature of microservice architectures, prior works that investigate metrics for anomaly detection rarely include explicit information about time-varying interdependencies. And whilst prior works on fault localisation typically do incorporate information about dependencies between microservices, they scale poorly to real world large-scale deployments due to their reliance on computationally expensive causal inference. To address these challenges we propose FC-ADL, an end-to-end scalable approach for detecting and localising anomalous changes from microservice metrics based on the neuroscientific concept of functional connectivity. We show that by efficiently characterising time-varying changes in dependencies between microservice metrics we can both detect anomalies and provide root cause candidates without incurring the significant overheads of causal and multivariate approaches. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve top detection and localisation performance across a wide degree of different fault scenarios when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we illustrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to Alibaba's extremely large real-world microservice deployment.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper develops and validates a psychometric scale to measure attitudes toward technical and sociotechnical infrastructure in software engineering, incorporating theories and detailed statistical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for rigorous sociotechnical research in software engineering by creating tailored psychometric scales for measuring attitudes.

Method: Grounded in theoretical frameworks, the researchers designed and administered a scale to 225 professionals. They employed exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to identify and confirm a two-factor structure. Validity was assessed through multiple statistical analyses.

Result: The scale demonstrated a robust two-factor structure, strong model fit, and clear validity in terms of face, criterion-related, convergent, and discriminant measures.

Conclusion: The validated scale effectively measures attitudes towards technical and sociotechnical infrastructure, advancing psychological measurement rigor in software engineering research.

Abstract: Context: Recent software engineering (SE) research has highlighted the need for sociotechnical research, implying a demand for customized psychometric scales. Objective: We define the concepts of technical and sociotechnical infrastructure in software engineering, and develop and validate a psychometric scale that measures attitudes toward them. Method: Grounded in theories of infrastructure, attitudes, and prior work on psychometric measurement, we defined the target constructs and generated scale items. The scale was administered to 225 software professionals and evaluated using a split sample. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on one half of the sample to uncover the underlying factor structure and performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other half to validate the structure. Further analyses with the whole sample assessed face, criterion-related, and discriminant validity. Results: EFA supported a two-factor structure (technical and sociotechnical infrastructure), accounting for 65% of the total variance with strong loadings. CFA confirmed excellent model fit. Face and content validity were supported by the item content reflecting cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. Both subscales were correlated with job satisfaction, perceived autonomy, and feedback from the job itself, supporting convergent validity. Regression analysis supported criterion-related validity, while the Heterotrait-Monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT), the Fornell-Larcker criterion, and model comparison all supported discriminant validity. Discussion: The resulting scale is a valid instrument for measuring attitudes toward technical and sociotechnical infrastructure in software engineering research. Our work contributes to ongoing efforts to integrate psychological measurement rigor into empirical and behavioral software engineering research.

### [715] [The AI Attribution Paradox: Transparency as Social Strategy in Open-Source Software Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00867)
*Obada Kraishan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores how developers attribute AI assistance in coding, analyzing 14,300 GitHub commits from 2023-2025. It finds strategic attribution patterns to manage scrutiny and highlights neutral community reactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how developers balance transparency and community scrutiny when attributing AI involvement in coding, and to examine how norms around AI assistance evolve over time.

Method: Analyzed 14,300 commits across 7,393 GitHub repositories from 2023-2025, focusing on attribution strategies, community responses, and tool variations for eight major AI tools.

Result: Found widespread AI usage (95.2%) with only 29.5% explicit attribution. Attribution patterns varied by tool and evolved rapidly; explicit attribution generally triggered modest scrutiny but didn't sway community sentiment, which remained neutral.

Conclusion: Attribution of AI assistance is a strategic communication tool influenced by tool choice and evolving norms. These findings provide insights into algorithmic accountability, community adaptation, and implications for future disclosure practices.

Abstract: AI coding assistants have transformed software development, raising questions about transparency and attribution practices. We examine the "AI attribution paradox": how developers strategically balance acknowledging AI assistance with managing community scrutiny. Analyzing 14,300 GitHub commits across 7,393 repositories from 2023-2025, we investigated attribution strategies and community responses across eight major AI tools. Results reveal widespread AI usage (95.2% of commits) but strategic attribution: only 29.5% employ explicit disclosure, with dramatic tool variation (Claude 80.5% versus Copilot 9.0%). Explicit attribution triggers modest scrutiny (23% more questions and 21% more comments) but tool choice matters 20-30 times more for predicting reception. Community sentiment remains neutral regardless of attribution type, suggesting curiosity rather than hostility. Temporal analyses show rapid norm evolution: explicit attribution increased from near-zero in early 2024 to 40% by late 2025, indicating community adaptation. These findings illuminate attribution as strategic communication rather than simple transparency, advancing understanding of algorithmic accountability and norm formation during technological transitions. We discuss implications for developers navigating disclosure decisions, platforms designing attribution mechanisms, and researchers studying emergent practices in AI-augmented collaborative work.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines the turnover intentions of software professionals, identifying critical factors like job satisfaction and embeddedness as key influences, with organizational justice and job quality playing significant roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turnover rates in the software industry lead to high costs and knowledge loss. This study seeks to understand factors affecting turnover intentions to develop effective retention strategies.

Method: The researchers carried out a cross-sectional survey with 224 software professionals, analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with 15 hypotheses from psychology and software engineering literature.

Result: Job satisfaction and embeddedness negatively correlate with turnover intentions. Organizational justice and job quality emerged as the strongest predictors of embeddedness and satisfaction, respectively, while work-life balance lacks direct impact on turnover intentions.

Conclusion: Enhancing job satisfaction and job embeddedness through factors like job quality, organizational justice, and supporting work-life balance can reduce turnover intentions among software professionals.

Abstract: Context: Voluntary turnover is common in the software industry, increasing recruitment and onboarding costs and the risk of losing organizational and tacit knowledge. Objective: This study investigates how job satisfaction, work-life balance, job embeddedness, and their antecedents, including job quality, personality traits, attitudes toward technical and sociotechnical infrastructure, and perceptions of organizational justice, relate to software professionals' turnover intentions. Method: We conducted a geographically diverse cross-sectional survey of software professionals (N = 224) and analyzed the data using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our model includes both reflective and formative constructs and tests 15 hypotheses grounded in occupational psychology and software engineering literature. Results: Job satisfaction and embeddedness were significantly negatively associated with software professionals' turnover intentions, while work-life balance showed no direct effect. The strongest antecedents for job satisfaction were work-life balance and job quality, while organizational justice was the strongest predictor of job embeddedness. Discussion: The resulting PLS-SEM model has considerably higher explanatory power for key outcome variables than previous work conducted in the software development context, highlighting the importance of both psychological (e.g., job satisfaction, job embeddedness) and organizational (e.g., organizational justice, job quality) factors in understanding turnover intentions of software professionals. Our results imply that improving job satisfaction and job embeddedness is the key to retaining software professionals. In turn, enhancing job quality, supporting work-life balance, and ensuring high organizational justice can improve job satisfaction and embeddedness, indirectly reducing turnover intentions.

*Muhammad Yousuf,Akshat Bagade,Chhittebbayi Penugonda,Maanas Baraya*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates variable name repair in C++ code to enhance comprehension by generating descriptive replacement names through a method that fine-tunes Llama 3.1 with LoRA adapters and a reranker.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges developers face with generic and misleading variable names, which hinder comprehension and increase bugs, making both human and machine code reasoning more difficult.

Method: The authors utilized Llama 3.1-8B as the foundation, introducing fine-tuning techniques such as warmup/dropout schedules, LoRA adapters for efficient task specialization, and a dual-encoder reranker to choose better replacement names.

Result: The best fine-tuned model achieved significant improvements: 43.1% exact match, 50.2% Top-5 Hit, and an 82.03 partial-match score, showcasing effectiveness in variable name repair compared to a 6.1% exact match achieved by zero-shot Llama 3.1.

Conclusion: The combination of task-specific fine-tuning and reranking mechanisms provides an effective and practical solution for identifier repair in source code, improving both the quality of output and applicability for development tools.

Abstract: Developers routinely work with source files whose variable names are generic or misleading, and with teams moving quickly, many functions are left undocumented. This slows comprehension, increases the risk of subtle bugs, and makes it harder for both humans and large language models (LLMs) to reason about code. We study variable name repair: given a real C++ function where all occurrences of one local or parameter name have been replaced by a placeholder (e.g. ID 1), the goal is to generate a natural, descriptive replacement name. We automatically construct this task from the C++ portion of BigCode's The Stack by parsing functions with Tree-sitter, masking a single identifier, and treating the original name as supervision. On top of Llama 3.1-8B, we build a pipeline with (i) warmup and dropout schedules for more stable fine-tuning, (ii) LoRA adapters for efficient specialization on identifier repair, and (iii) a dual-encoder reranker over top-k generator candidates. We evaluate using exact match, Top-5 Hit, and an embedding-based partial similarity score (0-100) that gives credit for near synonyms and format variants (e.g., jsonValue vs. json). On a held-out set of 200 C++ functions, a zero-shot Llama 3.1 baseline reaches 6.1 percent exact match. Our best LoRA-tuned model (with warmup and dropout) achieves 43.1 percent exact match, 50.2 percent Top-5 Hit, and an 82.03 partial-match score. A dual encoder reranker further improves selection quality without modifying the underlying generator, suggesting that task-specific fine-tuning plus reranking is a promising approach for practical identifier repair tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by brownfield engineering tasks in legacy systems where traditional methods fail due to incomplete documentation and fragmented architectural knowledge.

Method: The paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, using role-specific prompting strategies with Builder and Reviewer LLM agents to navigate ambiguity and deliver structured outputs.

Result: The exploratory study with 52 practitioners demonstrated perceived 26.9% productivity improvement, reduced cognitive load for 77% of participants, and less rework for 83%, providing preliminary evidence of the workflow's potential benefits.

Conclusion: Although the findings are self-reported and not experimentally verified, the results underline the potential of structured LLM workflows for addressing challenges in engineering brownfield systems while emphasizing the need for further controlled evaluations.

Abstract: Brownfield engineering work involving legacy systems, incomplete documentation, and fragmented architectural knowledge poses unique challenges for the effective use of large language models (LLMs). Prior research has largely focused on greenfield or synthetic tasks, leaving a gap in structured workflows for complex, context-heavy environments. This paper introduces the Discover-Define-Deliver (D3) Framework, a disciplined LLM-assisted workflow that combines role-separated prompting strategies with applied best practices for navigating ambiguity in brownfield systems. The framework incorporates a dual-agent prompting architecture in which a Builder model generates candidate outputs and a Reviewer model provides structured critique to improve reliability. I conducted an exploratory survey study with 52 software practitioners who applied the D3 workflow to real-world engineering tasks such as legacy system exploration, documentation reconstruction, and architectural refactoring. Respondents reported perceived improvements in task clarity, documentation quality, and cognitive load, along with self-estimated productivity gains. In this exploratory study, participants reported a weighted average productivity improvement of 26.9%, reduced cognitive load for approximately 77% of participants, and reduced rework for 83% during the Define phase. As these findings are self-reported and not derived from controlled experiments, they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence of practitioner sentiment rather than causal effects. The results highlight both the potential and limitations of structured LLM workflows for legacy engineering systems and motivate future controlled evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing software test coverage at scale in quality assurance pipelines.

Method: Implementation of a rubric-driven framework (LAJ) tested across 20 model configurations on 100 acceptance test scripts, measuring accuracy, reliability, and cost over multiple runs.

Result: Smaller models like GPT-4o Mini can outperform larger models in accuracy, reliability, and cost, with findings showing significant cost variability and dependence on reasoning effort.

Conclusion: LAJ demonstrates an effective, reproducible approach for streamlining QA test evaluation, offering both high performance and cost efficiency across different model configurations.

Abstract: Assessing software test coverage at scale remains a bottleneck in QA pipelines. We present LLM-as-a-Judge (LAJ), a production-ready, rubric-driven framework for evaluating Gherkin acceptance tests with structured JSON outputs. Across 20 model configurations (GPT-4, GPT-5 with varying reasoning effort, and open-weight models) on 100 expert-annotated scripts over 5 runs (500 evaluations), we provide the first comprehensive analysis spanning accuracy, operational reliability, and cost. We introduce the Evaluation Completion Rate (ECR@1) to quantify first-attempt success, revealing reliability from 85.4% to 100.0% with material cost implications via retries. Results show that smaller models can outperform larger ones: GPT-4o Mini attains the best accuracy (6.07 MAAE), high reliability (96.6% ECR@1), and low cost ($1.01 per 1K), yielding a 78x cost reduction vs. GPT-5 (high reasoning) while improving accuracy. Reasoning effort is model-family dependent: GPT-5 benefits from increased reasoning (with predictable accuracy-cost tradeoffs), whereas open-weight models degrade across all dimensions as reasoning increases. Overall, cost spans 175x ($0.45-$78.96 per 1K). We release the dataset, framework, and code to support reproducibility and deployment.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces LAURA, an LLM-based framework to address inefficiencies in code review by incorporating review knowledge and contextual augmentation. It outperforms previous methods in generating high-quality code reviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the bottleneck in the software development process caused by the time-consuming and knowledge-intensive nature of manual code reviews and the lack of experienced reviewers.

Method: The proposed framework, LAURA, integrates review exemplar retrieval, context augmentation, and systematic guidance to enhance code review generation using LLMs like ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek v3. It also employs a high-quality custom dataset for evaluations.

Result: Experimental results indicate that LAURA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, with generated reviews helpful in 42.2% and 40.4% of cases for two LLMs, respectively. Ablation studies confirm the positive impact of all components.

Conclusion: LAURA demonstrates substantial improvements in the quality of automated code reviews by leveraging contextual and prior review knowledge. This approach offers practical value in overcoming current code review challenges.

Abstract: Code review is critical for ensuring software quality and maintainability. With the rapid growth in software scale and complexity, code review has become a bottleneck in the development process because of its time-consuming and knowledge-intensive nature and the shortage of experienced developers willing to review code. Several approaches have been proposed for automatically generating code reviews based on retrieval, neural machine translation, pre-trained models, or large language models (LLMs). These approaches mainly leverage historical code changes and review comments. However, a large amount of crucial information for code review, such as the context of code changes and prior review knowledge, has been overlooked. This paper proposes an LLM-based review knowledge-augmented, context-aware framework for code review generation, named LAURA. The framework integrates review exemplar retrieval, context augmentation, and systematic guidance to enhance the performance of ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek v3 in generating code review comments. Besides, given the extensive low-quality reviews in existing datasets, we also constructed a high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that for both models, LAURA generates review comments that are either completely correct or at least helpful to developers in 42.2% and 40.4% of cases, respectively, significantly outperforming SOTA baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies demonstrate that all components of LAURA contribute positively to improving comment quality.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BackportBench, a benchmark suite for automated patch backporting, evaluating existing methods and identifying challenges across programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating security patches into older software safely and efficiently, as manual backporting is labor-intensive and error-prone.

Method: Development of BackportBench, a multilingual benchmark for patch backporting comprising 202 patches, Docker environments, and test cases. Evaluated traditional methods and LLM-based techniques.

Result: LLM-based methods outperformed traditional patch porting approaches for cases needing logical and structural changes, but performance varied by programming language.

Conclusion: BackportBench enables systematic evaluation of patch backporting techniques, providing insights and implications for advancing automated backporting solutions.

Abstract: Many modern software projects evolve rapidly to incorporate new features and security patches. It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.
  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.

*Pankaj Jalote,Y. Raghu Reddy,Vasudeva Varma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses an experiment in collaborative online teaching for a research-level course titled 'AI in Software Engineering' involving two institutions and active industry participation, proposing this as a model for small institutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage the now-accepted online teaching mode to collaboratively offer research-level courses in areas where individual institutions lack faculty expertise or student enrollment, with potential contributions from industry experts.

Method: The researchers designed and implemented an online research course, 'AI in Software Engineering,' collaboratively taught by two institutions with significant participation from industry professionals.

Result: The course successfully ran online with active engagement from academia and industry. Both student and faculty experiences were positive, demonstrating the feasibility of such collaboration.

Conclusion: Collaborative online teaching across institutions, especially in applied computer science fields, is a feasible and effective model for addressing challenges faced by smaller institutions in delivering advanced research-level courses.

Abstract: Covid has made online teaching and learning acceptable and students, faculty, and industry professionals are all comfortable with this mode. This comfort can be leveraged to offer an online multi-institutional research-level course in an area where individual institutions may not have the requisite faculty to teach and/or research students to enroll. If the subject is of interest to industry, online offering also allows industry experts to contribute and participate with ease. Advanced topics in Software Engineering are ideally suited for experimenting with this approach as industry, which is often looking to incorporate advances in software engineering in their practices, is likely to agree to contribute and participate. In this paper we describe an experiment in teaching a course titled "AI in Software Engineering" jointly between two institutions with active industry participation, and share our and student's experience. We believe this collaborative teaching approach can be used for offering research level courses in any applied area of computer science by institutions who are small and find it difficult to offer research level courses on their own.

For 122,425 source code repositories, the dataset provides metadata on latest versions, license information, programming languages and descriptive metadata files. We summarize the distributions of these features in the dataset and describe additional software metadata that extends the dataset in future work. Finally, we suggest examples of research that could use the dataset to develop a better understanding of research software practice in RSE research.

### [724] [GPTrace: Effective Crash Deduplication Using LLM Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01609)
*Patrick Herter,Vincent Ahlrichs,Ridvan Açilan,Julian Horsch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents GPTrace, a deduplication workflow leveraging large language models to cluster crashing inputs. It improves upon traditional methods for crash deduplication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuzzing uncovers numerous software vulnerabilities, but analyzing data and identifying duplicate crashes is time-consuming and inefficient. Existing methods struggle with accurate deduplication results.

Method: The proposed method, GPTrace, uses large language models to generate embedding vectors for crash-related data and applies clustering algorithms based on these vectors. This workflow simplifies and automates crash deduplication.

Result: GPTrace demonstrated significant performance improvements over conventional stack trace comparison methods and advanced existing approaches in evaluating over 300,000 crashes.

Conclusion: GPTrace provides a more efficient and effective solution for crash deduplication, showcasing the potential of large language models and clustering techniques.

Abstract: Fuzzing is a highly effective method for uncovering software vulnerabilities, but analyzing the resulting data typically requires substantial manual effort. This is amplified by the fact that fuzzing campaigns often find a large number of crashing inputs, many of which share the same underlying bug. Crash deduplication is the task of finding such duplicate crashing inputs and thereby reducing the data that needs to be examined. Many existing deduplication approaches rely on comparing stack traces or other information that is collected when a program crashes. Although various metrics for measuring the similarity of such pieces of information have been proposed, many do not yield satisfactory deduplication results. In this work, we present GPTrace, a deduplication workflow that leverages a large language model to evaluate the similarity of various data sources associated with crashes by computing embedding vectors and supplying those as input to a clustering algorithm. We evaluate our approach on over 300 000 crashing inputs belonging to 50 ground truth labels from 14 different targets. The deduplication results produced by GPTrace show a noticeable improvement over hand-crafted stack trace comparison methods and even more complex state-of-the-art approaches that are less flexible.

TL;DR: The paper examines using MPI-based synchronization for distributed fuzzing, showing performance improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current filesystem-based synchronization in distributed fuzzing is latency-prone and limits efficiency, requiring a more advanced communication model.

Method: The authors utilize lightweight MPI primitives for synchronization across fuzzing nodes and compare this to traditional approaches in standard benchmarks.

Result: MPI-based methods show enhanced performance, with improved coverage progression and reduced stagnation in exploring code paths during fuzzing.

Conclusion: The MPI-based synchronization approach improves scalability and effectiveness in distributed fuzzing, especially for CI/CD pipeline integration.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of MPI-based synchronization techniques into distributed fuzzing frameworks, highlighting possible substantial performance improvements compared to traditional filesystem-based synchronization methods. By employing lightweight MPI primitives, reductions in communication latency are achieved, facilitating more efficient data exchanges across distributed fuzzing nodes. Experimental results obtained over standard benchmarks demonstrate enhanced coverage progression from the early stages of the fuzzing process, which could be beneficial if fuzzing is employed in CI/CD pipelines at any stage of software development. Furthermore, the coordinated exchange of input corpora among clusters of fuzzers effectively addresses coverage stagnation, enabling a sustained exploration of complex and deep execution paths. Overall, the adoption of MPI-based synchronization approaches shows promising potential for significantly enhancing the scalability and efficacy of distributed fuzz testing.

*Ziheng Liu,Runzhi He,Minghui Zhou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Package Dashboard, a universal framework for analyzing software supply chains, integrating metadata, vulnerabilities, and community metrics to enhance risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current software composition analysis (SCA) tools that lack cross-ecosystem support and unified data reconciliation, impacting effective risk assessments.

Method: The framework integrates package metadata, vulnerabilities, and community health metrics while merging dependency resolution with repository analysis for a multi-faceted risk evaluation.

Result: The Package Dashboard was validated through a study of 374,000 packages across five Linux distributions, uncovering vulnerabilities, license issues, and risks from inaccessible or archived repositories.

Conclusion: Package Dashboard simplifies risk assessment for open-source ecosystems, offering developers actionable insights, bolstering transparency, trustworthiness, and traceability in software supply chains.

Abstract: Software supply chain attacks have revealed blind spots in existing SCA tools, which are often limited to a single ecosystem and assess either software artifacts or community activity in isolation. This fragmentation across tools and ecosystems forces developers to manually reconcile scattered data, undermining risk assessments. We present Package Dashboard, a cross-ecosystem framework that provides a unified platform for supply chain analysis, enabling a holistic, dual-perspective risk assessment by integrating package metadata, vulnerability information, and upstream community health metrics. By combining dependency resolution with repository analysis, it reduces cognitive load and improves traceability. Demonstrating the framework's versatility, a large-scale study of 374,000 packages across five Linux distributions shows its ability to uncover not only conventional vulnerabilities and license conflicts but also overlooked risks such as archived or inaccessible repositories. Ultimately, Package Dashboard provides a unified view of risk, equipping developers and DevSecOps engineers with actionable insights to strengthen the transparency, trustworthiness, and traceability of open-source ecosystems. Package Dashboard is publicly available at https://github.com/n19htfall/PackageDashboard, and a demonstration video can be found at https://youtu.be/y9ncftP8KPQ. Besides, the online version is available at https://pkgdash.osslab-pku.org.

*Philip Garrett,Juan P. Galeotti,Andrea Arcuri,Alexander Poth,Olsi Rrjolli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses novel deterministic techniques to generate descriptive names for REST API tests, compares them to LLM-based methods, and finds rule-based approaches to be competitive, lightweight, and effective for improving test suite readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor readability and usefulness of automatically generated test cases, typically given non-descriptive names, particularly within modern API-based architectures.

Method: The study presented three deterministic techniques and evaluated eight total methods (rule-based heuristics and LLM-based approaches) for naming REST API test cases from EvoMaster. Evaluation was conducted through surveys involving up to 39 participants and a case study at Volkswagen AG, assessing practical impact.

Result: A rule-based approach achieved the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performed on par with advanced LLMs like GPT-4o, and outperformed GPT-3.5. Feedback from an industrial setting further confirmed the approach improved test suite readability.

Conclusion: Lightweight, deterministic methods can effectively generate descriptive names for REST API tests, serving as a practical alternative to computationally intensive LLM-based models while improving developer-friendly test case comprehension.

Abstract: Automated test generation has become a key technique for ensuring software quality, particularly in modern API-based architectures. However, automatically generated test cases are typically assigned non-descriptive names (e.g., test0, test1), which reduces their readability and hinders their usefulness during comprehension and maintenance. In this work, we present three novel deterministic techniques to generate REST API test names. We then compare eight techniques in total for generating descriptive names for REST API tests automatically produced by the fuzzer EvoMaster, using 10 test cases generated for 9 different open-source APIs. The eight techniques include rule-based heuristics and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. Their effectiveness was empirically evaluated through two surveys (involving up to 39 people recruited via LinkedIn). Our results show that a rule-based approach achieves the highest clarity ratings among deterministic methods, performs on par with state-of-the-art LLM-based models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, and significantly outperforms GPT-3.5.
  To further evaluate the practical impact of our results, an industrial case study was carried out with practitioners who actively use EvoMaster at Volkswagen AG. A developer questionnaire was then carried out based on the use of EvoMaster on four different APIs by four different users, for a total of 74 evaluated test cases. Feedback from practitioners further confirms that descriptive names produced by this approach improve test suite readability.
  These findings highlight that lightweight, deterministic techniques can serve as effective alternatives to computationally expensive and security-sensitive LLM-based approaches for automated system-level test naming, providing a practical step toward more developer-friendly API test generation.

TL;DR: The paper conducts an empirical study on LLM-based agent frameworks, analyzing 11,910 developer discussions to compare frameworks across five dimensions and providing insights for future agent framework design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing number and challenges of agent frameworks in meeting developer needs and simplifying the agent development process.

Method: The study involves analyzing 11,910 developer discussions across ten identified frameworks, categorizing them based on five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability.

Result: The analysis highlights significant differences among the frameworks in meeting developers' needs, shedding light on recurring problems and areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable insights for improving existing LLM-based agent frameworks and guiding the design of future frameworks to better serve developers.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores free-ranging dogs' use of visual and olfactory cues during food finding, revealing flexible decision-making strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether free-ranging dogs prioritize visual or olfactory cues and understand their foraging strategy in urban environments.

Method: Performed food-based choice tests on free-ranging dogs to analyze their sensory prioritization and decision-making strategies.

Result: Dogs showed limited preference for olfactory cues over visual cues. Their decision-making prioritizes speed over accuracy and incorporates external and internal factors.

Conclusion: Free-ranging dogs adopt flexible foraging strategies due to urban environmental factors, using a good-enough approach rather than rigid sensory prioritization.

Abstract: Finding food is a fundamental activity for survival of all living organisms. Free-ranging dogs have been known to use their olfaction to assess the quality and type of available food but their use of visual ability in foraging is not well-documented. In the current study, we seek to remedy that by testing free-ranging dogs in a food-based choice test. We tested whether the dogs implemented hierarchical or synergistic usage of cues while finding food. We found limited prioritization of olfactory cues over visual cues in dichromatic choice tests but in phases with similar perceptual elements, the sensory choice was not clear. Furthermore, free-ranging dogs display a dynamic decision-making in unpredictable urban environments adopting a good-enough strategy during foraging. They prefer speed over accuracy, settling for intermediate quality food if their preferred food item is not available. These dogs also displayed left-bias during food choice. In multi-sensorial, natural setting multiple modulators like environmental noise, risk, and internal perceptual elements apart from food cues seem to be affecting the decision-making in dogs.

*Mengyuan Liu,Jing Hu,Zhenzhen Ru,Ruomeng Quan,Xu Zhang,Ning Qiang,Jin Li*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study involves multimodal MRI analysis using SC-FC coupling to detect brain network abnormalities and emotional disruptions caused by partial sleep deprivation (PSD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address sleep disorders as a global public health problem by uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive-emotional dysfunction associated with partial sleep deprivation using innovative neuroimaging methods.

Method: The study integrates diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to create SC-FC coupling models. Data from 20 PSD patients and 16 healthy controls are analyzed for structural and functional connectivity disruptions.

Result: Results reveal severe disruptions in functional networks, altered structural connectivity, significant SC-FC decoupling, and strong correlations of these changes with clinical measures (KSQ and HADS scores).

Conclusion: The integrated SC-FC coupling approach proves effective in identifying PSD-induced brain network and emotional dysregulations, providing new biomarkers and insights into the neural mechanism of PSD-linked SC-FC imbalances.

Abstract: Sleep disorder is a serious global public health issue, with cognitive-emotional dysfunction being a core symptom. The analysis of multimodal MRI data provides an effective method for detecting sleep deprivation-induced neural network abnormalities. The structure-function coupling (SC-FC) integrates functional connectivity with white matter structural information, which can enable comprehensive detection of brain network abnormalities and offer quantitative measures of sleep deprivation-induced neural damage. This study integrates diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to systematically investigate brain network reorganization and their relationship with emotional functions in partial sleep deprivation (PSD). Our methodology employed DTI to construct structural connectivity (SC) networks and rs-fMRI to establish functional connectivity (FC) networks, then construct SC-FC coupling model . The experiment included 16 healthy controls (HC) and 20 PSD patients, with comprehensive whole-brain and nodal-level SC-FC analyses performed. The results show that (1) severe FC disruptions in PSD patients involving the limbic system, default mode network, sensorimotor network, and visual networks; (2) altered SC in default mode, sensorimotor, visual, language, and auditory networks; (3) significant SC-FC decoupling in these networks; and (4) strong correlations between these neural changes and clinical measures (KSQ and HADS scores). The SC-FC coupling approach achieved comprehensive detection of PSD-related network abnormalities. Compared to single-modal approaches, this integrated SC-FC analysis provides more comprehensive biomarkers for sleep-related emotional dysregulation. This innovative multimodal neuroimaging approach elucidates the neural mechanisms of SC-FC imbalance induced by PSD, establishing novel biomarkers for sleep-mediated emotional dysregulation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a biomimetic metamaterial interface (BMMI) that mimics human skin's structure to decode mechanodermal activity (MDA), offering applications in healthcare and human-machine interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underutilization of spatiotemporal mechanical cues of human skin due to limitations in current sensing technologies.

Method: The authors designed a BMMI, an engineered auxetic metamaterial substrate that mimics the structure of natural skin, enabling the capture and decoding of MDA through signal amplification and noise suppression.

Result: The BMMI, along with bespoke algorithms, demonstrated the ability to accurately and robustly decode diverse MDA signals for multimodal communication interfaces.

Conclusion: The BMMI provides a pathway for advanced healthcare monitoring and effective human-machine interaction by leveraging previously untapped mechanical signals of human skin.

Abstract: Human skin acts as a dynamic biomechanical interface that conveys critical physiological and behavioural information through spatiotemporally distributed deformations. Due to the limited capabilities of current sensing technologies, the spatiotemporal diversity of its mechanical cues has remained underutilised to date, preventing these mechanisms from being used to capture and decode the full spectrum of underlying physiological states. In this work, we define this heterogeneous set of mechanical signals as mechanodermal activity (MDA) and introduce the biomimetic metamaterial-based interface (BMMI), an engineered auxetic metamaterial substrate that reproduces the microrelief and mechanoreceptor architecture of natural skin. The BMMI allows selective capture of diverse MDA signals from adjacent skin regions with simultaneous signal amplification and noise suppression, and permits straightforward modulation to accommodate various scenarios. Combined with bespoke algorithms, the wireless BMMI device decodes MDA accurately and robustly for multimodal communication interfaces, unleashing applications in healthcare monitoring and human-machine interaction.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how psychological and physiological states interact dynamically, rejecting simplistic models and introducing a mathematical framework to better understand the complexity of these interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing models that analyze physiological and psychological states in isolation, making it difficult to explain sudden changes in mental or bodily states reported by individuals.

Method: Utilizes mathematical modeling to explain rapid transitions in states, linking bodily signals to subjective experiences for a dynamic and comprehensive understanding.

Result: The framework highlights how bodily-driven and cognitively-driven changes behave differently in terms of sudden state transitions.

Conclusion: By integrating physiological signals with subjective experiences, the study sets the stage for improved dynamic modeling and deeper analysis of individual cases.

Abstract: In real life, psychological and physiological states rarely change along a single dimension. Through self-tracking and discussions with clinicians, I have come to recognise with increasing clarity that sleep patterns, autonomic arousal, bodily sensations, and cognitive load are in constant interaction. Existing models often fail to capture this complexity. Many theoretical frameworks continue to analyse these elements in isolation, making it difficult to explain sudden changes reported by individuals,such as abrupt spikes in anxiety, sudden drops in dissociation, or even moments of heightened alertness. The mathematical modelling employed herein does not replace clinical or subjective narratives, but rather provides a structural framework for these rapid transitions and elucidates why bodily-driven and cognitively-driven changes manifest differently. The objective is to build a conceptual bridge between physiological signals and lived experience, laying the groundwork for dynamic modelling and future case analyses.

TL;DR: A study applying quantum information principles, specifically rebits, to reformulate perceptual color attributes and validating the model through experimental methods using qubit density matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To refine and test the perceptual color space model by integrating quantum information principles.

Method: Utilized Jordan algebra formalism with spin factors for reformulation, and applied qubit density matrices for experimental validation.

Result: Quantum information-based perceptual attributes of colors were successfully computed, bridging the theoretical concept and experimental testing.

Conclusion: The reformulated model of color perception using quantum information principles is experimentally viable, despite using rebits instead of qubits.

Abstract: Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schrödinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.

*Xin Li*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biological model for how the brain uses memory-amortized inference (MAI) to efficiently shift computational cost from exploration to certainty, drawing from Savitch's theorem in computation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between the computational principles of space-time trade-offs (Savitch's theorem) and biological efficiency in the brain, explaining how intelligence emerges as a balance between generalization and hallucination.

Method: The authors formalize the brain's cortical algorithm as recursive topological transformations, collapsing high-frequency cycles into stable memory units. This process reduces complex search into simpler serial navigation through geometrical and topological mechanisms.

Result: By converting complex high-entropy search into efficient low-entropy structures, the brain achieves exponential representational power from linear cortical growth. However, this introduces a trade-off where efficiency can lead to errors like hallucination.

Conclusion: Intelligence is defined as the ability to balance between abstraction (which aids in generalization) and avoiding topological errors, with the 'Geometry of Certainty' characterizing this trade-off.

Abstract: Computation fundamentally separates time from space: nondeterministic search is exponential in time but polynomially simulable in space (Savitch's Theorem). We propose that the brain physically instantiates a biological variant of this theorem through Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI), creating a geometry of certainty from the chaos of exploration. We formalize the cortical algorithm as a recursive topological transformation of flow into scaffold:$H_{odd}^{(k)} \xrightarrow{\text{Condense}} H_{even}^{(k+1)}$, where a stable, high-frequency cycle ($β_1$) at level $k$ is collapsed into a static atomic unit ($β_0$) at level $k+1$. Through this Topological Trinity (Search $\to$ Closure $\to$ Condensation), the system amortizes the thermodynamic cost of inference. By reducing complex homological loops into zero-dimensional defects (memory granules), the cortex converts high-entropy parallel search into low-entropy serial navigation. This mechanism builds a ``Tower of Scaffolds'' that achieves structural parity with the environment, allowing linear cortical growth to yield exponential representational reach. However, this efficiency imposes a strict limit: the same metric contraction that enables \emph{generalization} (valid manifold folding) inevitably risks \emph{hallucination} (homological collapse). We conclude that intelligence is the art of navigating this trade-off, where the ``Geometry of Certainty'' is defined by the precise threshold between necessary abstraction and topological error.

*Fernando E. Rosas*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper links hierarchical emergence in systems to underlying symmetries, showing how these symmetries create macroscopic levels and shape Bayesian belief hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how nested hierarchical structures emerge in systems and relate to underlying symmetries.

Method: Combines principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics to explore how dynamical processes with symmetry groups result in emergent hierarchical levels.

Result: Shows that symmetries create macroscopic levels and corresponding epistemic hierarchies, providing examples through Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion.

Conclusion: Symmetries act as a fundamental mechanism for emergence, linking objective/system processes with epistemic/inferential processes, improving solvability of computational problems.

Abstract: Many systems of interest exhibit nested emergent layers with their own rules and regularities, and our knowledge about them seems naturally organised around these levels. This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.

Motivation: To understand how variations in voltage-gated ion channel isoforms impact neuronal excitability and action-potential generation.

Method: Combining a Markov model of NaV channels and a KV3.1 model, with computational analyses involving bifurcation theory and stability mapping of oscillatory regions.

Result: NaV1.3, NaV1.4, and NaV1.6 isoforms promote broad excitability landscapes, while NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 show limited oscillatory properties.

Conclusion: Channel heterogeneity is key in neuronal dynamics and may inform synthetic system design for enhanced action-potential robustness.

Abstract: We investigate a conductance-based neuron model to explore how voltage-gated ion channel isoforms influence action-potential generation. The model combines a six-state Markov representation of NaV channels with a first-order KV3.1 model, allowing us to vary maximal sodium and potassium conductances and compare nine NaV isoforms. Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.

### [738] [The Modeler Schema Theory of Consciousness, with a Falsifiable Experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01073)
*Frank Heile*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes that consciousness emerges from a specific control agent called the Modeler-schema, which checks the brain's internal World Model for consistency using qualia. A testable hypothesis is provided to support this proposal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the Hard Problem of consciousness by linking qualitative experiences (qualia) to the regulation of internal representations in the brain, and by developing a concrete, testable framework.

Method: The authors outline a hypothesis where the Modeler-schema monitors the brain's Modeler during saccades and applies a qualia-based consistency check. A saccadic change-detection experiment is proposed to test this mechanism.

Result: The proposed approach identifies the role of the Modeler-schema, connects qualia to internal representation regulation, and suggests a testable framework for exploring conscious experience.

Conclusion: Consciousness may arise from the Modeler-schema's interaction with the brain's Modeler through qualia, offering a pathway to empirical exploration and understanding of the Hard Problem of consciousness.

Abstract: We propose that consciousness arises from a single control agent, the Modeler-schema. It monitors the brain's Modeler as that system constructs and updates the internal World Model. As part of that monitoring, the Modeler-schema generates experience by applying a qualia-based consistency check to the Modeler's output. The Human Agent comprises three cooperating agents: Modeler, Controller, and Targeter, each paired with an associated regulatory "schema" agent. We also describe fast-Modelers and fast-Controllers; evolutionary shortcuts whose rapid actions will precede awareness. Our core prediction is that the Modeler-schema performs a qualia-based consistency check during saccades and issues a bottom-up target when a discrepancy is found. To test this prediction, we propose a saccadic change-detection experiment that distinguishes Modeler-generated from Modeler-schema-generated targets. Locating qualia in the Modeler-schema ties experience to the regulation and refinement of internal representations, clarifies how awareness arises from model control, and suggests a path toward empirical falsification, thereby offering a concrete, testable proposal toward solving the Hard Problem of consciousness.

### [739] [A framework for disentangling spatial and visual neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01962)
*Mai M. Morimoto,Julien Fournier,Aman B. Saleem*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to identify spatial modulation in primary visual cortex neurons using virtual reality and computational modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work has shown that neural responses in the primary visual cortex are influenced by spatial non-visual cues, but the spatial profile of these signals remains unknown.

Method: A virtual reality setup is designed to decorrelate vision and spatial cues alongside a Generalized Linear Model to isolate spatial contributions in neural activity.

Result: The framework successfully identified spatial modulation in mouse V1 neurons, revealing heterogeneous and multi-peaked spatial profiles.

Conclusion: This approach provides a method for analyzing spatial signals influencing sensory processing, with potential applications to large-scale brain studies.

Abstract: Neurons in cortical areas often integrate signals from different origins. In the primary visual cortex (V1), neural responses are modulated by non-visual context such as the animal's position. However, the spatial profile of these position signals across the environment remains unknown. Here, we propose a new framework to disentangle visual and spatial contributions in virtual reality. This method relies on two principles: 1) a virtual corridor design that decorrelates vision and space through targeted cue repetitions and manipulations and 2) a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that explicitly estimates visual contributions in retinotopic rather than environmental coordinates. In simulations, we demonstrate that this framework is highly specific (recovering spatial modulation only when present) and effectively captures the profile and weight of spatial gain fields across the environment. When applied to V1 recordings from mice navigating the virtual corridor, the model isolated significant spatial components in a substantial fraction of V1 neurons. The recovered spatial components exhibited heterogeneous, often multi-peaked, profiles. Application of this framework to large-scale recordings may provide a robust approach to characterize the nature of spatial signals modulating sensory processing across brain areas.

### [740] [DAISI: Data Assimilation with Inverse Sampling using Stochastic Interpolants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00252)
*Martin Andrae,Erik Larsson,So Takao,Tomas Landelius,Fredrik Lindsten*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAISI, a novel data assimilation method using flow-based generative models for improved probabilistic inference in nonlinear and non-Gaussian regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical DA methods struggle with stability and accuracy when states and observations are non-Gaussian, necessitating advancements for better handling of challenging scenarios.

Method: DAISI employs pre-trained flow-based generative models combined with guidance-based conditional sampling and an inverse-sampling step to incorporate model dynamics effectively without retraining.

Result: DAISI demonstrated superior filtering performance in experiments involving nonlinear systems with sparse and noisy observations, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DAISI algorithm extends DA capabilities, offering stable and accurate filtering in complex regimes while mitigating limitations of Gaussian-based approaches.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations and heuristic tuning (e.g., inflation and localization) to scale to high dimensions. While often successful, these approximations can make the methods unstable or inaccurate when the underlying distributions of states and observations depart significantly from Gaussianity. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior to assimilate observations via guidance-based conditional sampling while incorporating forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step. This step maps the forecast ensemble into a latent space to provide initial conditions for the conditional sampling, allowing us to encode model dynamics into the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.

### [741] [An RKHS Perspective on Tree Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00397)
*Mehdi Dagdoug,Clement Dombry,Jean-Jil Duchamps*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for analyzing tree-based ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting using Random Forest RKHS, demonstrating its analytical properties and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical understanding of the strong empirical performance of Random Forests and Gradient Boosting through the lens of RKHS and data-dependent geometry.

Method: The paper proposes using RKHS derived from the random partitions of regression trees to analyze ensemble methods, showcasing analytical properties and linking them to penalized empirical risk and gradient flows.

Result: The authors establish foundational properties of the Random Forest kernel, interpret ensemble methods through variational principles, and propose novel applications like kernel PCA and a geometric variable importance criterion.

Conclusion: The introduced RKHS framework gives a unified theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of tree-based ensembles and offers tools to improve model interpretability and performance.

Abstract: Random Forests and Gradient Boosting are among the most effective algorithms for supervised learning on tabular data. Both belong to the class of tree-based ensemble methods, where predictions are obtained by aggregating many randomized regression trees. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing such methods through Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) constructed on tree ensembles -- more precisely, on the random partitions generated by randomized regression trees. We establish fundamental analytical properties of the resulting Random Forest kernel, including boundedness, continuity, and universality, and show that a Random Forest predictor can be characterized as the unique minimizer of a penalized empirical risk functional in this RKHS, providing a variational interpretation of ensemble learning. We further extend this perspective to the continuous-time formulation of Gradient Boosting introduced by Dombry and Duchamps, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a gradient flow on a Hilbert manifold induced by the Random Forest RKHS. A key feature of this framework is that both the kernel and the RKHS geometry are data-dependent, offering a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of tree-based ensembles. Finally, we illustrate the practical potential of this approach by introducing a kernel principal component analysis built on the Random Forest kernel, which enhances the interpretability of ensemble models, as well as GVI, a new geometric variable importance criterion.

### [742] [No-Regret Gaussian Process Optimization of Time-Varying Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00517)
*Eliabelle Mauduit,Eloïse Berthier,Andrea Simonetto*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces W-SparQ-GP-UCB, an online algorithm to optimize time-varying functions via heteroscedastic GP regression, achieving low regret with minimal additional queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Process bandit algorithms struggle with time-varying black-box functions, as no-regret optimization is unattainable under strict bandit feedback without unrealistic assumptions.

Method: Introduces uncertainty injection (UI) to adapt past observations for heteroscedastic GP regression, allowing limited additional queries on observed data. Builds on sparse inference to design W-SparQ-GP-UCB for time-varying optimization.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves no-regret with a vanishing number of additional queries. Theoretical limits are analyzed, showing efficient query bounds for different levels of time-variation.

Conclusion: The framework achieves efficient time-varying optimization, linking function dynamics to query-efficiency and regret bounds. This marks a step forward in practical non-stationary optimization.

Abstract: Sequential optimization of black-box functions from noisy evaluations has been widely studied, with Gaussian Process bandit algorithms such as GP-UCB guaranteeing no-regret in stationary settings. However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed.
  In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose \textbf{W-SparQ-GP-UCB}, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking the degree of time-variation of the function to achievable regret rates, together with upper and lower bounds on the number of additional queries needed in each regime.

### [743] [Statistical-computational gap in multiple Gaussian graph alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00610)
*Bertrand Even,Luca Ganassali*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates the statistical-computational gap in aligning multiple Gaussian graphs and establishes informational thresholds and computational barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the challenges in solving multiple Gaussian graph alignment, highlighting the statistical-computational gap in specific regimes.

Method: The authors generalize informational thresholds from earlier work, analyze regimes of increasing observed graphs, and establish computational barriers using the low-degree framework.

Result: Results indicate that aligning $p$ graphs in polynomial time is as challenging as aligning two graphs, and the task becomes infeasible under certain correlation and logarithmic conditions.

Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of statistical-computational gaps in Gaussian graph alignment, demonstrating that polynomial-time algorithms struggle with complex bi-dimensional structures.

Abstract: We investigate the existence of a statistical-computational gap in multiple Gaussian graph alignment. We first generalize a previously established informational threshold from Vassaux and Massoulié (2025) to regimes where the number of observed graphs $p$ may also grow with the number of nodes $n$: when $p \leq O(n/\log(n))$, we recover the results from Vassaux and Massoulié (2025), and $p \geq Ω(n/\log(n))$ corresponds to a regime where the problem is as difficult as aligning one single graph with some unknown "signal" graph. Moreover, when $\log p = ω(\log n)$, the informational thresholds for partial and exact recovery no longer coincide, in contrast to the all-or-nothing phenomenon observed when $\log p=O(\log n)$. Then, we provide the first computational barrier in the low-degree framework for (multiple) Gaussian graph alignment. We prove that when the correlation $ρ$ is less than $1$, up to logarithmic terms, low degree non-trivial estimation fails. Our results suggest that the task of aligning $p$ graphs in polynomial time is as hard as the problem of aligning two graphs in polynomial time, up to logarithmic factors. These results characterize the existence of a statistical-computational gap and provide another example in which polynomial-time algorithms cannot handle complex combinatorial bi-dimensional structures.

### [744] [Self-sufficient Independent Component Analysis via KL Minimizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00665)
*Song Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel way to learn disentangled signals using non-linear ICA, introducing a self-sufficient signals framework by minimizing a conditional KL divergence, avoiding both priors and adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of independent component analysis often involves imposing restrictive priors or using adversarial training, which can limit flexibility or stability. This paper seeks a more robust and flexible method for disentangling signals.

Method: A sequential algorithm is designed to minimize a conditional KL divergence to learn optimal de-mixing flow models iteratively, without utilizing priors or adversarial training.

Result: The method successfully disentangles signals in both toy datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its flexibility and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective solution for disentangling signals, avoiding prior dependencies and adversarial instability, and achieves favorable experimental performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning disentangled signals from data using non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning, we propose to learn self-sufficient signals: A recovered signal should be able to reconstruct a missing value of its own from all remaining components without relying on any other signals. We formulate this problem as the minimization of a conditional KL divergence. Compared to traditional maximum likelihood estimation, our algorithm is prior-free and likelihood-free, meaning that we do not need to impose any prior on the original signals or any observational model, which often restricts the model's flexibility. To tackle the KL divergence minimization problem, we propose a sequential algorithm that reduces the KL divergence and learns an optimal de-mixing flow model at each iteration. This approach completely avoids the unstable adversarial training, a common issue in minimizing the KL divergence. Experiments on toy and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our method.

### [745] [Restricted Block Permutation for Two-Sample Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00668)
*Jungwoo Ho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured permutation scheme with restricted one-swap permutations for two-sample testing, showing higher power and maintaining exact validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical permutation tests often rely on full relabeling, which may lead to inefficiencies and limited statistical power under certain conditions.

Method: The authors develop a restricted permutation approach using single cross-swaps between block-selected representatives, derive key variance-reduction formulas, and provide data-dependent critical values for testing.

Result: The restricted permutation scheme achieves sharper variance contraction, smaller critical values, and higher statistical power compared to classical full permutation methods.

Conclusion: Block-restricted one-swap permutation methods are a valid, efficient, and more powerful alternative to traditional full permutation testing.

Abstract: We study a structured permutation scheme for two-sample testing that restricts permutations to single cross-swaps between block-selected representatives. Our analysis yields three main results. First, we provide an exact validity construction that applies to any fixed restricted permutation set. Second, for both the difference of sample means and the unbiased $\widehat{\mathrm{MMD}}^{2}$ estimator, we derive closed-form one-swap increment identities whose conditional variances scale as $O(h^{2})$, in contrast to the $Θ(h)$ increment variability under full relabeling. This increment-level variance contraction sharpens the Bernstein--Freedman variance proxy and leads to substantially smaller permutation critical values. Third, we obtain explicit, data-dependent expressions for the resulting critical values and statistical power. Together, these results show that block-restricted one-swap permutations can achieve strictly higher power than classical full permutation tests while maintaining exact finite-sample validity, without relying on pessimistic worst-case Lipschitz bounds.

*Dimitri Meunier,Jakub Wornbard,Vladimir R. Kostic,Antoine Moulin,Alek Fröhlich,Karim Lounici,Massimiliano Pontil,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve causal effect estimation by making learned spectral features outcome-aware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses inaccuracies in nonparametric instrumental variable regression due to hidden confounders and the failure of spectral feature techniques when the causal function is poorly represented in dominant spectral functions.

Method: The paper introduces 'Augmented Spectral Feature Learning,' which uses a contrastive loss augmented with outcome information to make feature learning more aligned with the true causal functions.

Result: The proposed framework is theoretically supported and shows improved performance on benchmarks, especially under scenarios of spectral misalignment.

Conclusion: Incorporating outcome-awareness into feature learning enhances the accuracy of causal effect estimation in complex settings.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. An established approach is to use estimators based on learned spectral features, that is, features spanning the top singular subspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. While powerful, such features are agnostic to the outcome variable. Consequently, the method can fail when the true causal function is poorly represented by these dominant singular functions. To mitigate, we introduce Augmented Spectral Feature Learning, a framework that makes the feature learning process outcome-aware. Our method learns features by minimizing a novel contrastive loss derived from an augmented operator that incorporates information from the outcome. By learning these task-specific features, our approach remains effective even under spectral misalignment. We provide a theoretical analysis of this framework and validate our approach on challenging benchmarks.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces MOL-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm, for multi-objective linear contextual bandit problems. It efficiently manages multiple objectives by leveraging a novel effective Pareto front and has strong regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing potentially conflicting objectives in multi-objective linear contextual bandit settings, with limited existing methods providing guarantees for performance.

Method: The authors developed MOL-TS, a Thompson Sampling-based method that uses a novel effective Pareto front to select arms, making decisions based on repeated selections over time. It offers theoretical Pareto regret bounds.

Result: MOL-TS achieves a worst-case Pareto regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, which aligns with the best results for single objective randomized linear bandits. Experimental results validate its superiority.

Conclusion: MOL-TS is an efficient and theoretically sound approach for addressing multi-objective linear contextual bandit problems, improving regret minimization and multi-objective optimization simultaneously.

Abstract: We study the multi-objective linear contextual bandit problem, where multiple possible conflicting objectives must be optimized simultaneously. We propose \texttt{MOL-TS}, the \textit{first} Thompson Sampling algorithm with Pareto regret guarantees for this problem. Unlike standard approaches that compute an empirical Pareto front each round, \texttt{MOL-TS} samples parameters across objectives and efficiently selects an arm from a novel \emph{effective Pareto front}, which accounts for repeated selections over time. Our analysis shows that \texttt{MOL-TS} achieves a worst-case Pareto regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature vectors, $T$ is the total number of rounds, matching the best known order for randomized linear bandit algorithms for single objective. Empirical results confirm the benefits of our proposed approach, demonstrating improved regret minimization and strong multi-objective performance.

*Victor Saquicela,Kenneth Palacio-Baus,Mario Chifla*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between K-means clustering of transposed data and PCA for analyzing variable clusters' contribution to principal components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the overlooked relationship between clustering variables using K-means on transposed data and PCA components.

Method: They apply PCA to the original dataset, K-means clustering to the transposed data, and quantify variable cluster contributions using loading-based measures.

Result: The proposed method allows analysis and understanding of how variable clusters from K-means relate to principal dimensions from PCA.

Conclusion: The research enhances exploration of multivariate relationships by integrating insights from PCA and K-means clustering of variables.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means constitute fundamental techniques in multivariate analysis. Although they are frequently applied independently or sequentially to cluster observations, the relationship between them, especially when K-means is used to cluster variables rather than observations, has been scarcely explored. This study seeks to address this gap by proposing an innovative method that analyzes the relationship between clusters of variables obtained by applying K-means on transposed data and the principal components of PCA. Our approach involves applying PCA to the original data and K-means to the transposed data set, where the original variables are converted into observations. The contribution of each variable cluster to each principal component is then quantified using measures based on variable loadings. This process provides a tool to explore and understand the clustering of variables and how such clusters contribute to the principal dimensions of variation identified by PCA.

TL;DR: Smart Bayes integrates generative likelihood ratios into a logistic regression framework for improved classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance classification by bridging generative and discriminative modeling, leveraging strengths of both approaches.

Method: It introduces Smart Bayes, which utilizes data-driven coefficients on density-ratio features with a new spline-based univariate log-density ratio estimator.

Result: Smart Bayes showed superior performance compared to logistic regression and Naive Bayes in simulations and real-data studies.

Conclusion: Hybrid methods like Smart Bayes can capitalize on generative structures for better discriminative classification outcomes.

Abstract: We introduce Smart Bayes, a new classification framework that bridges generative and discriminative modeling by integrating likelihood-ratio-based generative features into a logistic-regression-style discriminative classifier. From the generative perspective, Smart Bayes relaxes the fixed unit weights of Naive Bayes by allowing data-driven coefficients on density-ratio features. From a discriminative perspective, it constructs transformed inputs as marginal log-density ratios that explicitly quantify how much more likely each feature value is under one class than another, thereby providing predictors with stronger class separation than the raw covariates. To support this framework, we develop a spline-based estimator for univariate log-density ratios that is flexible, robust, and computationally efficient. Through extensive simulations and real-data studies, Smart Bayes often outperforms both logistic regression and Naive Bayes. Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that exploit generative structure to enhance discriminative performance.

*Jiajia Yu,Junghwan Lee,Yao Xie,Xiuyuan Cheng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to solve high-dimensional Mean-field games (MFGs) and optimal transport problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean-field games, which model the Nash equilibrium of systems with many interacting agents, are challenging to solve in high dimensions due to computational and analytical constraints.

Method: The study proposes a proximal fixed-point scheme where particles are updated using first-order information. A flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner.

Result: The proposed method achieves sublinear convergence rates theoretically and linear/exponential rates under convexity assumptions. It also demonstrates strong performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional optimal transport problems.

Conclusion: The particle-based FM approach provides a promising computational framework for solving high-dimensional MFG problems, bridging Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations effectively.

Abstract: Mean-field games (MFGs) study the Nash equilibrium of systems with a continuum of interacting agents, which can be formulated as the fixed-point of optimal control problems. They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces INO-PCA, an online PCA algorithm that removes explicit norm constraints, leading to better learning performance and adaptability in non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the parameter norm in online learning algorithms can encode meaningful problem-specific information, often discarded by conventional methods.

Method: Proposes INO-PCA, an algorithm with dynamically evolving parameter norms governed by nonlinear PDE analysis and introduces mechanisms to capture relationships between norm, SNR, and step size.

Result: Demonstrates that INO-PCA consistently outperforms conventional Oja's algorithm and adapts well to varying conditions, exposing insights about learning behavior and phase transitions.

Conclusion: Relaxing norm constraints in online learning can be an effective way to utilize problem-relevant information, yielding improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Many online learning algorithms, including classical online PCA methods, enforce explicit normalization steps that discard the evolving norm of the parameter vector. We show that this norm can in fact encode meaningful information about the underlying statistical structure of the problem, and that exploiting this information leads to improved learning behavior. Motivated by this principle, we introduce Implicitly Normalized Online PCA (INO-PCA), an online PCA algorithm that removes the unit-norm constraint and instead allows the parameter norm to evolve dynamically through a simple regularized update. We prove that in the high-dimensional limit the joint empirical distribution of the estimate and the true component converges to a deterministic measure-valued process governed by a nonlinear PDE. This analysis reveals that the parameter norm obeys a closed-form ODE coupled with the cosine similarity, forming an internal state variable that regulates learning rate, stability, and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting dynamics uncover a three-way relationship between the norm, SNR, and optimal step size, and expose a sharp phase transition in steady-state performance. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that INO-PCA consistently outperforms Oja's algorithm and adapts rapidly in non-stationary environments. Overall, our results demonstrate that relaxing norm constraints can be a principled and effective way to encode and exploit problem-relevant information in online learning algorithms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), which extends post-training quantization (PTQ) methods by optimizing across larger submodules in models, enhancing efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current PTQ methods focus only on individual layers of models, failing to preserve the behavior of larger submodules effectively.

Method: LPCD optimizes relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and uses layer-wise quantizers to project solutions, combining efficiency with refined quantization of complex submodules.

Result: LPCD consistently improves submodule quantization performance across diverse large language model (LLM) architectures and various bit-widths.

Conclusion: LPCD provides a generalized and principled framework that enhances existing PTQ methods and submodule quantization approaches, optimizing model-level behavior effectively.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) aims to preserve model-level behavior; however, most methods focus on individual linear layers. Even recent extensions, such as QEP and LoaQ, which mitigate error propagation or target specific submodules, still rely on layer-wise formulations and fail to capture the behavior of larger submodules. We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in decentralized data learning, particularly ensuring privacy guarantees and reducing communication costs.

Method: The authors propose Fed-Sparse-BNSL, which combines differential privacy and targeted greedy updates for efficient model structure learning.

Result: Experiments showed Fed-Sparse-BNSL achieves accuracy close to non-private baselines while optimizing privacy and communication efficiency.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances privacy, communication efficiency, and model performance in federated Bayesian network learning.

Abstract: Learning the structure of a Bayesian network from decentralized data poses two major challenges: (i) ensuring rigorous privacy guarantees for participants, and (ii) avoiding communication costs that scale poorly with dimensionality. In this work, we introduce Fed-Sparse-BNSL, a novel federated method for learning linear Gaussian Bayesian network structures that addresses both challenges. By combining differential privacy with greedy updates that target only a few relevant edges per participant, Fed-Sparse-BNSL efficiently uses the privacy budget while keeping communication costs low. Our careful algorithmic design preserves model identifiability and enables accurate structure estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that Fed-Sparse-BNSL achieves utility close to non-private baselines while offering substantially stronger privacy and communication efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing bipartite networks fail to consider shared patterns across networks, limiting the understanding of how environmental factors influence these communities.

Method: The colBiSBM framework extends the Latent Block Model (LBM) for multiple bipartite networks, using a shared mesoscale structure and a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation to identify common patterns.

Result: The model improves network classification, clustering performance, and link prediction by leveraging shared patterns. Simulations and real data applications, such as plant-pollinator networks, validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Joint modeling via colBiSBM reveals shared structures and connectivity patterns, offering methodological and practical advantages over analyzing networks separately.

Abstract: Bipartite networks are widely used to encode the ecological interactions. Being able to compare the organization of bipartite networks is a first step toward a better understanding of how environmental factors shape community structure and resilience. Yet current methods for structure detection in bipartite networks overlook shared patterns across collections of networks. We introduce the \emph{colBiSBM}, a family of probabilistic models for collections of bipartite networks that extends the classical Latent Block Model (LBM). The proposed framework assumes that networks are independent realizations of a shared mesoscale structure, encoded through common inter-block connectivity parameters. We establish identifiability conditions for the different variants of \emph{colBiSBM} and develop a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation, coupled with an adaptation of the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL) criterion for model selection. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to classify networks based on their topology or organization. Simulation studies highlight the ability of \emph{colBiSBM} to recover common structures, improve clustering performance, and enhance link prediction by borrowing strength across networks. An application to plant--pollinator networks highlights how the method uncovers shared ecological roles and partitions networks into sub-collections with similar connectivity patterns. These results illustrate the methodological and practical advantages of joint modeling over separate network analyses in the study of bipartite systems.

### [755] [Decision Tree Embedding by Leaf-Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01819)
*Cencheng Shen,Yuexiao Dong,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a method utilizing tree partitions to create interpretable feature representations, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high variance of single decision trees and the computational overhead of ensembles like random forests while maintaining interpretability and efficiency.

Method: The method constructs an embedding space from the leaf partitions of a trained decision tree using sample means as anchor points, with an ensemble extension via bootstrap trees and pairing with linear discriminant analysis for classification.

Result: The proposed DTE method achieves a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, performing comparably or better than random forests and shallow neural networks, with faster training times.

Conclusion: The DTE method integrates the strengths of decision trees and neural networks, providing a robust and efficient classification approach with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Decision trees and random forest remain highly competitive for classification on medium-sized, standard datasets due to their robustness, minimal preprocessing requirements, and interpretability. However, a single tree suffers from high estimation variance, while large ensembles reduce this variance at the cost of substantial computational overhead and diminished interpretability. In this paper, we propose Decision Tree Embedding (DTE), a fast and effective method that leverages the leaf partitions of a trained classification tree to construct an interpretable feature representation. By using the sample means within each leaf region as anchor points, DTE maps inputs into an embedding space defined by the tree's partition structure, effectively circumventing the high variance inherent in decision-tree splitting rules. We further introduce an ensemble extension based on additional bootstrap trees, and pair the resulting embedding with linear discriminant analysis for classification. We establish several population-level theoretical properties of DTE, including its preservation of conditional density under mild conditions and a characterization of the resulting classification error. Empirical studies on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that DTE strikes a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming or matching random forest and shallow neural networks while requiring only a fraction of their training time in most cases. Overall, the proposed DTE method can be viewed either as a scalable decision tree classifier that improves upon standard split rules, or as a neural network model whose weights are learned from tree-derived anchor points, achieving an intriguing integration of both paradigms.

*Valentin de Bortoli,Romuald Elie,Anna Kazeykina,Zhenjie Ren,Jiacheng Zhang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper derives a dimension-free computational error bound for diffusion generative models, proposing an optimal time-scheduling strategy for reverse-time simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing error bounds (such as KL divergence and Wasserstein distance) for diffusion models which are impractical or limited in high-dimensional settings.

Method: Developed a dimension-independent bound using a weaker, functional metric with smooth test functionals, and formulated a variational problem to minimize time-discretization error.

Result: Derived optimal time-scheduling strategies for reverse-time diffusion and justified their effectiveness analytically for minimizing discretization bias.

Conclusion: The proposed dimension-free metric and optimal scheduling advance understanding of error characterization and reduction for generative diffusion models, improving sampling quality and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.

In the first part, we introduce the general concepts and the statistical flavor of regression versus other forms of curve fitting. We then move to an overview of traditional methods from machine learning and their classification and ways to link these to traditional computational science. Finally, we close with a note on methods to combine machine learning and numerical methods for physics

TL;DR: The paper combines artificial intelligence and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to solve complex optimization problems in air transportation, focusing on structural embeddings and model explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate AI with MILP, improving optimization and explainability in critical sectors like air transportation.

Method: Used Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to generate feature embeddings from a bipartite graph representation of MILP instances and analyzed these representations with dimensionality reduction techniques.

Result: GCN outperformed GAT by better capturing the global topology and clustering structure of the problem's variables and constraints.

Conclusion: Simpler graph-based architectures like GCN can effectively address aviation logistics problems and enhance solver performance without requiring manual feature engineering.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.

TL;DR: The study uses a digital trout model with neuromuscular control and deep learning to explore energy-efficient fish swimming mechanics, revealing optimal activation strategies for energy saving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the link between neural-muscle control and whole-body movements in fish, targeting applications in biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and engineering.

Method: A bio-inspired digital trout model was developed, integrating multibody dynamics, muscle modeling, fluid-structure interaction, and deep reinforcement learning for neuromuscular control.

Result: Key findings include optimal muscle activation strategies like appropriate myomere coupling, moderate contraction duration, and control over phase lag, which ensure energy-efficient and stable swimming.

Conclusion: The research enhances understanding of fish locomotion mechanics and offers strategies for designing energy-efficient underwater systems.

Abstract: Understanding efficient fish locomotion offers insights for biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and engineering. Traditional studies often miss the link between neuromuscular control and whole-body movement. To explore energy transfer in carangiform swimming, we created a bio-inspired digital trout. This model combined multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction algorithm, accurately replicating a real trout's form and properties. Using deep reinforcement learning, the trout's neural system achieved hierarchical spatiotemporal control of muscle activation. We systematically examined how activation strategies affect speed and energy use. Results show that axial myomere coupling-with activation spanning over 0.5 body lengths-is crucial for stable body wave propagation. Moderate muscle contraction duration ([0.1,0.3] of a tail-beat cycle) lets the body and fluid act as a passive damping system, cutting energy use. Additionally, the activation phase lag of myomeres shapes the body wave; if too large, it causes antagonistic contractions that hinder thrust. These findings advance bio-inspired locomotion understanding and aid energy-efficient underwater system design.

*Sigurd Vargdal,Paula Reis,Henrik Andersen Sveinsson,Gaute Linga*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper presents the use of deep learning for predicting permeability tensors in porous media using binary images, achieving efficient and accurate predictions compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining permeability tensors in porous media using conventional methods is often time-consuming and resource-intensive, whereas analytical approaches lack accuracy. The study seeks to explore deep learning as a faster, more accurate alternative.

Method: A dataset of 24,000 synthetic binary images of porous media was produced, and permeability tensors were computed using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations. Several deep learning models (ResNet, Vision Transformers, ConvNeXt) were trained with techniques like weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation.

Result: ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest prediction accuracy with an $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on unseen test data. The study found that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster but are sensitive to overtraining.

Conclusion: Image-based neural networks, particularly ConvNeXt-Small, show promise for accurately predicting permeability tensors, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Permeability is a central concept in the macroscopic description of flow through porous media, with applications spanning from oil recovery to hydrology. Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately.

### [762] [Statistical Inference under Adaptive Sampling with LinUCB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00222)
*Wei Fan,Kevin Tan,Yuting Wei*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper establishes the stability property for the LinUCB algorithm in linear bandit settings, deriving a central limit theorem and asymptotic normality for estimation error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive data collection introduces biases, making traditional statistical inference tools ineffective. Stability can mitigate these biases and enable accurate inference.

Method: The authors analyze the LinUCB algorithm's behavior through spectral properties of the random design covariance matrix, deriving the central limit theorem for its estimation error.

Result: The study shows the covariance matrix decomposes into components, enabling asymptotic normality at a $T^{-1/4}$ rate, with confidence sets that outperform nonasymptotic ones.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that LinUCB's properties allow for accurate statistical inference, offering improvements in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

Abstract: Adaptively collected data has become ubiquitous within modern practice. However, even seemingly benign adaptive sampling schemes can introduce severe biases, rendering traditional statistical inference tools inapplicable. This can be mitigated by a property called stability, which states that if the rate at which an algorithm takes actions converges to a deterministic limit, one can expect that certain parameters are asymptotically normal. Building on a recent line of work for the multi-armed bandit setting, we show that the linear upper confidence bound (LinUCB) algorithm for linear bandits satisfies this property. In doing so, we painstakingly characterize the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the random design feature covariance matrix in the setting where the action set is the unit ball, showing that it decomposes into a rank-one direction that locks onto the true parameter and an almost-isotropic bulk that grows at a predictable $\sqrt{T}$ rate. This allows us to establish a central limit theorem for the LinUCB algorithm, establishing asymptotic normality for the limiting distribution of the estimation error where the convergence occurs at a $T^{-1/4}$ rate. The resulting Wald-type confidence sets and hypothesis tests do not depend on the feature covariance matrix and are asymptotically tighter than existing nonasymptotic confidence sets. Numerical simulations corroborate our findings.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper develops a general framework to formalize differential privacy through statistical hypothesis testing, introducing $f$-DP and its characterization via limit experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a statistically sound baseline privacy metric under practical and theoretical differential privacy setups.

Method: Using the $f$-DP framework and leveraging Le Cam's limit experiment theory to analyze composition mechanisms, determining limiting trade-off functions via infinitely divisible distributions.

Result: The study identifies that limiting trade-off functions are determined by infinitely divisible laws hence generalizing Gaussian differential privacy, deriving new non-Gaussian cases and resolving observed empirical phenomena.

Conclusion: By extending the $f$-DP framework, the work provides a broader understanding of differential privacy guarantees, paving the way for new, optimal privacy mechanisms.

Abstract: Differential privacy is increasingly formalized through the lens of hypothesis testing via the robust and interpretable $f$-DP framework, where privacy guarantees are encoded by a baseline Blackwell trade-off function $f_{\infty} = T(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$ involving a pair of distributions $(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$. The problem of choosing the right privacy metric in practice leads to a central question: what is a statistically appropriate baseline $f_{\infty}$ given some prior modeling assumptions? The special case of Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) showed that, under compositions of nearly perfect mechanisms, these trade-off functions exhibit a central limit behavior with a Gaussian limit experiment. Inspired by Le Cam's theory of limits of statistical experiments, we answer this question in full generality in an infinitely divisible setting.
  We show that suitable composition experiments $(P_n^{\otimes n}, Q_n^{\otimes n})$ converge to a binary limit experiment $(P_{\infty}, Q_{\infty})$ whose log-likelihood ratio $L = \log(dQ_{\infty} / dP_{\infty})$ is infinitely divisible under $P_{\infty}$. Thus any limiting trade-off function $f_{\infty}$ is determined by an infinitely divisible law $P_{\infty}$, characterized by its Levy--Khintchine triplet, and its Esscher tilt defined by $dQ_{\infty}(x) = e^{x} dP_{\infty}(x)$. This characterizes all limiting baseline trade-off functions $f_{\infty}$ arising from compositions of nearly perfect differentially private mechanisms. Our framework recovers GDP as the purely Gaussian case and yields explicit non-Gaussian limits, including Poisson examples. It also positively resolves the empirical $s^2 = 2k$ phenomenon observed in the GDP paper and provides an optimal mechanism for count statistics achieving asymmetric Poisson differential privacy.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing 4D reconstruction methods, which struggle to generate high-quality topology-consistent meshes needed for applications like animation and model editing.

Method: A novel Gaussian topological structure is proposed to encode spatial connectivity explicitly, with topology-aware densification, pruning, temporal regularization, and differentiable mesh rasterization to ensure quality and coherence.

Result: The proposed method successfully reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with higher accuracy compared to existing methods and facilitates precise 3D keypoint tracking.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates a significant improvement in generating topology-consistent meshes, providing a useful tool for applications requiring accurate mesh reconstructions.

Abstract: Topology-consistent dynamic model sequences are essential for applications such as animation and model editing. However, existing 4D reconstruction methods face challenges in generating high-quality topology-consistent meshes. To address this, we propose a topology-aware dynamic reconstruction framework based on Gaussian Splatting. We introduce a Gaussian topological structure that explicitly encodes spatial connectivity. This structure enables topology-aware densification and pruning, preserving the manifold consistency of the Gaussian representation. Temporal regularization terms further ensure topological coherence over time, while differentiable mesh rasterization improves mesh quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches. Moreover, the resulting meshes enable precise 3D keypoint tracking. Project page: https://haza628.github.io/tagSplat/

TL;DR: This paper addresses the security risks posed by quantum adversaries to cryptographic audit trails used in regulated AI workloads and proposes quantum-safe solutions and migration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To secure cryptographic evidence structures against quantum adversaries in regulated industries and extend the evidentiary lifetime of existing deployments.

Method: The paper formalizes security notions in a quantum context, analyzes a post-quantum hash-and-sign approach in the quantum random-oracle model, and proposes migration strategies like hybrid signatures and Merkle-root anchoring.

Result: Quantum-safe audit trails with moderate overhead are achievable, and systematic migration strategies can preserve security in existing implementations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a pathway for deploying and migrating constant-size evidence structures in a quantum-adversary-threatened environment.

Abstract: Constant-size cryptographic evidence records are increasingly used to build audit trails for regulated AI workloads in clinical, pharmaceutical, and financial settings, where each execution is summarized by a compact, verifiable record of code identity, model version, data digests, and platform measurements. Existing instantiations, however, typically rely on classical signature schemes whose long-term security is threatened by quantum-capable adversaries. In this paper we formalize security notions for evidence structures in the presence of quantum adversaries and study post-quantum (PQ) instantiations and migration strategies for deployed audit logs. We recall an abstraction of constant-size evidence structures and introduce game-based definitions of Q-Audit Integrity, Q-Non-Equivocation, and Q-Binding, capturing the inability of a quantum adversary to forge, equivocate, or rebind evidence items. We then analyze a hash-and-sign instantiation in the quantum random-oracle model (QROM), assuming an existentially unforgeable PQ signature scheme against quantum adversaries, and show that the resulting evidence structure satisfies these notions under standard assumptions. Building on this, we present three migration patterns for existing evidence logs: hybrid signatures, re-signing of legacy evidence, and Merkle-root anchoring, and analyze their security, storage, and computational trade-offs. A case study based on an industrial constant-size evidence platform for regulated AI at Codebat Technologies Inc. suggests that quantum-safe audit trails are achievable with moderate overhead and that systematic migration can significantly extend the evidentiary lifetime of existing deployments.

Method: The study performs an attack surface analysis from a platform-user viewpoint and develops a systematic attack suite to expose vulnerabilities. Defense mechanisms are also proposed based on these findings.

Result: The study identifies security vulnerabilities in GPT systems through multidimensional attack strategies and demonstrates these threats in practice.

Conclusion: The paper raises awareness about security risks in GPT-based systems, provides insights to mitigate these vulnerabilities, and emphasizes the need for secure and responsible AI application.

Abstract: Equipped with various tools and knowledge, GPTs, one kind of customized AI agents based on OpenAI's large language models, have illustrated great potential in many fields, such as writing, research, and programming. Today, the number of GPTs has reached three millions, with the range of specific expert domains becoming increasingly diverse. However, given the consistent framework shared among these LLM agent applications, systemic security vulnerabilities may exist and remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we present an empirical study on the security vulnerabilities of GPTs. Building upon prior research on LLM security, we first adopt a platform-user perspective to conduct a comprehensive attack surface analysis across different system components. Then, we design a systematic and multidimensional attack suite with the explicit objectives of information leakage and tool misuse based on the attack surface analysis, thereby concretely demonstrating the security vulnerabilities that various components of GPT-based systems face. Finally, we accordingly propose defense mechanisms to address the aforementioned security vulnerabilities. By increasing the awareness of these vulnerabilities and offering critical insights into their implications, this study seeks to facilitate the secure and responsible application of GPTs while contributing to developing robust defense mechanisms that protect users and systems against malicious attacks.

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in evaluating LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection by proposing benchmarks and frameworks that tackle coverage, labeling accuracy, and realistic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to systematically assess and benchmark the true capability of LLMs in detecting JavaScript vulnerabilities while addressing issues like incomplete coverage, inaccurate labeling, and unrealistic test cases.

Method: The authors introduce principles for better benchmarks and propose FORGEJS (framework for benchmark generation), ARENAJS (systematic benchmark), and JUDGEJS (evaluation framework) to test commercial LLMs systematically.

Result: Their evaluation reveals that LLMs suffer from limited reasoning abilities and robustness issues, highlighting significant gaps in current JavaScript vulnerability detection methods using LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs currently face significant shortcomings in vulnerability detection for JavaScript, and reliable solutions remain an open research challenge.

Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect vulnerabilities in JavaScript, especially those assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.
  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.
  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.

Abstract: Modern circuits face various threats like reverse engineering, theft of intellectual property (IP), side-channel attacks, etc. Here, we present a novel approach for IP protection based on logic encryption (LE). Unlike established schemes for logic locking, our work obfuscates the circuit's structure and functionality by encoding and encrypting the logic itself. We devise an end-to-end method for practical LE implementation based on standard cryptographic algorithms, key-bit randomization, simple circuit design techniques, and system-level synthesis operations, all in a correct-by-construction manner. Our extensive analysis demonstrates the remarkable efficacy of our scheme, outperforming prior art against a range of oracle-less attacks covering crucial threat vectors, all with lower design overheads. We provide a full open-source release.

Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is an essential cryptographic protocol for privacy-preserving applications, enabling a client to retrieve a record from a server's database without revealing which record was requested. Single-server PIR based on homomorphic encryption has particularly gained immense attention for its ease of deployment and reduced trust assumptions. However, single-server PIR remains impractical due to its high computational and memory bandwidth demands. Specifically, reading the entirety of large databases from storage, such as SSDs, severely limits its performance. To address this, we propose IVE, an accelerator for single-server PIR with a systematic extension that enables practical retrieval from large databases using DRAM. Recent advances in DRAM capacity allow PIR for large databases to be served entirely from DRAM, removing its dependence on storage bandwidth. Although the memory bandwidth bottleneck still remains, multi-client batching effectively amortizes database access costs across concurrent requests to improve throughput. However, client-specific data remains a bottleneck, whose bandwidth requirements ultimately limits performance. IVE overcomes this by employing a large on-chip scratchpad with an operation scheduling algorithm that maximizes data reuse, further boosting throughput. Additionally, we introduce sysNTTU, a versatile functional unit that enhances area efficiency without sacrificing performance. We also propose a heterogeneous memory system architecture, which enables a linear scaling of database sizes without a throughput degradation. Consequently, IVE achieves up to 1,275x higher throughput compared to prior PIR hardware solutions.

### [770] [NetDeTox: Adversarial and Efficient Evasion of Hardware-Security GNNs via RL-LLM Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00119)
*Zeng Wang,Minghao Shao,Akashdeep Saha,Ramesh Karri,Johann Knechtel,Muhammad Shafique,Ozgur Sinanoglu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NetDeTox is a new framework integrating large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to perform targeted adversarial netlist rewrites, reducing GNN effectiveness with minimal design overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of GNNs in hardware security to adversarial netlist rewrites, and to reduce the high overheads of existing adversarial approaches while preserving functionality.

Method: NetDeTox uses RL to identify key netlist components for GNN reasoning and LLM to suggest rewriting plans, combining iterative feedback between RL and LLM for optimized rewrites with low overhead.

Result: NetDeTox achieves higher effectiveness compared to previous methods like AttackGNN, reducing area overheads by 54.50% (GNN-RE), 25.44% (GNN4IP), and 41.04% (OMLA), and even optimizing benchmarks for larger circuits in GNN4IP.

Conclusion: NetDeTox demonstrates practical and scalable adversarial netlist rewrites, weakening GNN-based security mechanisms while minimizing resource overhead.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in hardware security by learning structural motifs from netlist graphs. However, this reliance on motifs makes GNNs vulnerable to adversarial netlist rewrites; even small-scale edits can mislead GNN predictions. Existing adversarial approaches, ranging from synthesis-recipe perturbations to gate transformations, come with high design overheads. We present NetDeTox, an automated end-to-end framework that orchestrates large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) in a systematic manner, enabling focused local rewriting. The RL agent identifies netlist components critical for GNN-based reasoning, while the LLM devises rewriting plans to diversify motifs that preserve functionality. Iterative feedback between the RL and LLM stages refines adversarial rewritings to limit overheads. Compared to the SOTA work AttackGNN, NetDeTox successfully degrades the effectiveness of all security schemes with fewer rewrites and substantially lower area overheads (reductions of 54.50% for GNN-RE, 25.44% for GNN4IP, and 41.04% for OMLA, respectively). For GNN4IP, ours can even optimize/reduce the original benchmarks' area, in particular for larger circuits, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of NetDeTox.

### [771] [Securing Large Language Models (LLMs) from Prompt Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01326)
*Omar Farooq Khan Suri,John McCrae*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the robustness of JATMO fine-tuning against genetic attack framework HOUYI and finds that while JATMO improves defense against prompt injection attacks, vulnerabilities still remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks pose risks to Large Language Models deployed in real-world applications; the need arises for models that are less susceptible while maintaining task-specific performance.

Method: Researchers fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B using JATMO and assessed their robustness against HOUYI, which leverages mutations and optimizations of adversarial prompts to test defenses.

Result: JATMO reduces attack success rates compared to instruction-tuned models but does not eliminate vulnerabilities, particularly with multilingual cues or code-based prompts. A trade-off between model performance and injection resistance was also observed.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning via JATMO offers improved defenses but highlights the necessity for multi-layered strategies addressing adversarial prompt injections.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.

*Xinyun Zhou,Xinfeng Li,Yinan Peng,Ming Xu,Xuanwang Zhang,Miao Yu,Yidong Wang,Xiaojun Jia,Kun Wang,Qingsong Wen,XiaoFeng Wang,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability, termed EmoRAG, in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, showing their susceptibility to minimal emoticon injection, which disrupts retrieval and output. Proposed defenses are analyzed, but current solutions remain insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate and address the robustness of RAG systems, which are critical for enhancing large language models with external knowledge, by exposing previously overlooked vulnerabilities.

Method: The study introduces EmoRAG, analyzing how minimal symbolic perturbations such as a single emoticon impact RAG systems. Extensive experiments, diverse datasets, state-of-the-art retrievers, and generators are used to identify and study the phenomenon.

Result: Key results include (1) single emoticons causing disruptive retrieval, (2) strong positional sensitivity, and (3) larger parameter models being more vulnerable to perturbations. Existing defenses are found inadequate for solving this issue.

Conclusion: Current RAG systems are critically vulnerable to subtle manipulations like emoticons. The analysis provides insights into the failings of robustness assumptions and proposes initial steps and future directions for developing more resilient systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly central to robust AI, enhancing large language model (LLM) faithfulness by incorporating external knowledge. However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as "(@_@)" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RT-LRM, a benchmark to assess the trustworthiness of Large Reasoning Models, focusing on truthfulness, safety, and efficiency. Extensive experiments reveal vulnerabilities and insights, with tools and datasets to support research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in evaluating trustworthiness and risks of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that emerge from reasoning-induced vulnerabilities and inefficiencies.

Method: The authors propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark alongside a suite of 30 reasoning tasks. They analyze the impact of training paradigms and evaluate trustworthiness through experiments on 26 reasoning models.

Result: The experiments reveal that LRMs often face trustworthiness challenges and are more fragile than Large Language Models when encountering reasoning-induced risks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerabilities of LRMs and suggests the need for more targeted evaluation methods. Open-source tools and datasets are provided to support future research.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful advancement in multi-step reasoning tasks, offering enhanced transparency and logical consistency through explicit chains of thought (CoT). However, these models introduce novel safety and reliability risks, such as CoT-hijacking and prompt-induced inefficiencies, which are not fully captured by existing evaluation methods. To address this gap, we propose RT-LRM, a unified benchmark designed to assess the trustworthiness of LRMs. RT-LRM evaluates three core dimensions: truthfulness, safety and efficiency. Beyond metric-based evaluation, we further introduce the training paradigm as a key analytical perspective to investigate the systematic impact of different training strategies on model trustworthiness. We achieve this by designing a curated suite of 30 reasoning tasks from an observational standpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on 26 models and identify several valuable insights into the trustworthiness of LRMs. For example, LRMs generally face trustworthiness challenges and tend to be more fragile than Large Language Models (LLMs) when encountering reasoning-induced risks. These findings uncover previously underexplored vulnerabilities and highlight the need for more targeted evaluations. In addition, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research to support future advancements in this important field. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced.

*Haoyu Shen,Weimin Lyu,Haotian Xu,Tengfei Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores concept-guided backdoor attacks on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing two semantic-level attack methods instead of traditional pixel-level approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose and address security vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by investigating concept-level backdoor attacks, which have been underexplored compared to pixel-based attacks.

Method: The paper introduces two mechanisms for concept-guided backdoor attacks: Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), which triggers attacks based on explicit concepts in images, and Concept Bottleneck Model-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), which manipulates internal concept activations during training.

Result: Both CTP and CGUB demonstrate high attack success rates, maintaining sufficient performance on clean tasks, and reveal serious vulnerabilities in current VLM architectures.

Conclusion: Concept-guided backdoor attacks operate through semantic triggers and represent a novel and critical threat for VLMs, underscoring the need for enhanced security measures in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal text generation, yet their rapid adoption raises increasing concerns about security vulnerabilities. Existing backdoor attacks against VLMs primarily rely on explicit pixel-level triggers or imperceptible perturbations injected into images. While effective, these approaches reduce stealthiness and remain vulnerable to image-based defenses. We introduce concept-guided backdoor attacks, a new paradigm that operates at the semantic concept level rather than on raw pixels. We propose two different attacks. The first, Concept-Thresholding Poisoning (CTP), uses explicit concepts in natural images as triggers: only samples containing the target concept are poisoned, causing the model to behave normally in all other cases but consistently inject malicious outputs whenever the concept appears. The second, CBL-Guided Unseen Backdoor (CGUB), leverages a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) during training to intervene on internal concept activations, while discarding the CBM branch at inference time to keep the VLM unchanged. This design enables systematic replacement of a targeted label in generated text (for example, replacing "cat" with "dog"), even when the replacement behavior never appears in the training data. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures and datasets show that both CTP and CGUB achieve high attack success rates while maintaining moderate impact on clean-task performance. These findings highlight concept-level vulnerabilities as a critical new attack surface for VLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper examines the evolutionary trends and connections among malware specimens using a new manually-reviewed malware dataset and introduces multi-view genealogy analysis for clearer insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of malware and extensive code reuse has created complex connections among malware specimens, challenging existing methods in understanding these trends.

Method: A dataset containing 6032 manually-reviewed malware specimens was used to systematically evaluate various software aspects (quality, costs, security) and multi-view genealogy analysis was introduced to trace malware lineage and connections.

Result: Malware exhibits increasing complexity and standardization, despite poor code quality. Genealogy analysis reveals lineage expansion driven by code reuse, offering insights into malware development.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of malware evolution, highlighting the impact of code reuse and the need for tools to map evolutionary connections in the malware ecosystem.

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of malware and extensive code reuse have formed complex evolutionary connections among malware specimens. The rapid pace of development makes it challenging for existing studies to characterize recent evolutionary trends. In addition, intuitive tools to untangle these intricate connections between malware specimens or categories are urgently needed. This paper introduces a manually-reviewed malware source code dataset containing 6032 specimens. Building on and extending current research from a software engineering perspective, we systematically evaluate the scale, development costs, code quality, as well as security and dependencies of modern malware. We further introduce a multi-view genealogy analysis to clarify malware connections: at an overall view, this analysis quantifies the strength and direction of connections among specimens and categories; at a detailed view, it traces the evolutionary histories of individual specimens. Experimental results indicate that, despite persistent shortcomings in code quality, malware specimens exhibit an increasing complexity and standardization, in step with the development of mainstream software engineering practices. Meanwhile, our genealogy analysis intuitively reveals lineage expansion and evolution driven by code reuse, providing new evidence and tools for understanding the formation and evolution of the malware ecosystem.

### [777] [Bias Injection Attacks on RAG Databases and Sanitization Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00804)
*Hao Wu,Prateek Saxena*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a new class of attack on vector databases in retrieval-augmented generation systems: bias injection. It also proposes a defense method called BiasDef.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of vector databases to bias injection attacks, where factually correct yet semantically biased content covertly manipulates the ideological framing of large language model (LLM) outputs.

Method: The authors define the nature of bias injection attacks and introduce a post-retrieval filtering defense method called BiasDef. They evaluate both the attacks and defenses using benchmarks constructed from public question-answering datasets.

Result: The bias injection attacks induce significant shifts in the output perspectives of LLMs and bypass existing defenses. BiasDef outperforms alternatives by reducing adversarial content retrieval by 15% and mitigating perspective shifts in LLM answers by 6.2×, while allowing the retrieval of 62% more benign passages.

Conclusion: The research highlights the subtle risks posed by bias injection attacks, showing their potential to influence LLM outputs despite current defenses. BiasDef proves effective in mitigating these issues and enhancing retrieval integrity.

Abstract: This paper explores attacks and defenses on vector databases in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Prior work on knowledge poisoning attacks primarily inject false or toxic content, which fact-checking or linguistic analysis easily detects. We reveal a new and subtle threat: bias injection attacks, which insert factually correct yet semantically biased passages into the knowledge base to covertly influence the ideological framing of answers generated by large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that these adversarial passages, though linguistically coherent and truthful, can systematically crowd out opposing views from the retrieved context and steer LLM answers toward the attacker's intended perspective.
  We precisely characterize this class of attacks and then develop a post-retrieval filtering defense, BiasDef. We construct a comprehensive benchmark based on public question answering datasets to evaluate them. Our results show that: (1) the proposed attack induces significant perspective shifts in LLM answers, effectively evading existing retrieval-based sanitization defenses; and (2) BiasDef outperforms existing methods by reducing adversarial passages retrieved by 15\% which mitigates perspective shift by 6.2\times in answers, while enabling the retrieval of 62\% more benign passages.

*Binghui Wu,Dinil Mon Divakaran,Levente Csikor,Mohan Gurusamy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RECTor, a machine learning framework aimed at improving traffic correlation attacks on the Tor network with high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic correlation methods for the Tor network struggle with noise, partial data, and scalability, creating a need for more robust and efficient solutions.

Method: The proposed RECTor uses attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), GRU-based temporal encoding, Siamese networks, and approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search to achieve robust and scalable flow representations and matching.

Result: RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reduces training/inference time by over 50%, alongside enhanced scalability.

Conclusion: The results expose critical vulnerabilities in Tor's anonymity model and emphasize the need for advanced defenses against increasingly effective traffic correlation attacks.

Abstract: Tor is a widely used anonymity network that conceals user identities by routing traffic through encrypted relays, yet it remains vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks that deanonymize users by matching patterns in ingress and egress traffic. However, existing correlation methods suffer from two major limitations: limited robustness to noise and partial observations, and poor scalability due to computationally expensive pairwise matching. To address these challenges, we propose RECTor, a machine learning-based framework for traffic correlation under realistic conditions. RECTor employs attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and GRU-based temporal encoding to extract robust flow representations, even when traffic data is incomplete or obfuscated. These embeddings are mapped into a shared space via a Siamese network and efficiently matched using approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search. Empirical evaluations show that RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCorr, DeepCOFFEA, and FlowTracker, achieving up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reducing training and inference time by over 50%. Moreover, RECTor demonstrates strong scalability: inference cost grows near-linearly as the number of flows increases. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Tor's anonymity model and highlight the need for advanced model-aware defenses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents the HMARK watermarking scheme to detect and protect against unauthorized training of diffusion models with marked data, exhibiting high detection accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unchecked use of data with uncertain ownership in training generative diffusion models raises concerns about intellectual property rights, necessitating mechanisms to trace and protect such data.

Method: The proposed HMARK encodes ownership as multi-bit watermarks in a semantic-latent space (h-space) of diffusion models, ensuring imperceptible, robust, and radioactive traits by embedding signals related to semantic attributes of images.

Result: HMARK achieves impressive performance metrics by showing 98.57% detection accuracy, 95.07% bit-level recovery, full recall rate, and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 1.0 under various distortion scenarios.

Conclusion: HMARK is a robust and imperceptible watermarking solution capable of protecting intellectual property during training of diffusion models, ensuring effective traceability and usability in adversarial configurations.

Abstract: Modern generative diffusion models rely on vast training datasets, often including images with uncertain ownership or usage rights. Radioactive watermarks -- marks that transfer to a model's outputs -- can help detect when such unauthorized data has been used for training. Moreover, aside from being radioactive, an effective watermark for protecting images from unauthorized training also needs to meet other existing requirements, such as imperceptibility, robustness, and multi-bit capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HMARK, a novel multi-bit watermarking scheme, which encodes ownership information as secret bits in the semantic-latent space (h-space) for image diffusion models. By leveraging the interpretability and semantic significance of h-space, ensuring that watermark signals correspond to meaningful semantic attributes, the watermarks embedded by HMARK exhibit radioactivity, robustness to distortions, and minimal impact on perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that HMARK achieves 98.57% watermark detection accuracy, 95.07% bit-level recovery accuracy, 100% recall rate, and 1.0 AUC on images produced by the downstream adversarial model finetuned with LoRA on watermarked data across various types of distortions.

*Mintong Kang,Chong Xiang,Sanjay Kariyappa,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li,Edward Suh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces IntentGuard, a defense framework against indirect prompt injection attacks (IPIAs) in large language models (LLMs) through intent analysis and neutralization of malicious instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the critical threat posed by IPIAs, where LLMs act on malicious instructions embedded in input data, potentially compromising their security and reliability.

Method: IntentGuard employs an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to determine actionable instructions recognized by LLMs, using strategies like prefilling, refinement, and adversarial demonstration to elicit instruction intent. Malicious overlaps with untrusted data are then flagged or neutralized.

Result: The proposed method was tested on two agentic benchmarks with two LLMs, showing IntentGuard significantly reduced attack success rates (e.g., from 100% to 8.5%) with negligible impact on utility in most cases.

Conclusion: IntentGuard effectively neutralizes IPIAs in LLMs by understanding their instruction-following intent, combining robustness with minimal utility trade-offs, and providing a reliable framework for combating such attacks.

Abstract: Indirect prompt injection attacks (IPIAs), where large language models (LLMs) follow malicious instructions hidden in input data, pose a critical threat to LLM-powered agents. In this paper, we present IntentGuard, a general defense framework based on instruction-following intent analysis. The key insight of IntentGuard is that the decisive factor in IPIAs is not the presence of malicious text, but whether the LLM intends to follow instructions from untrusted data. Building on this insight, IntentGuard leverages an instruction-following intent analyzer (IIA) to identify which parts of the input prompt the model recognizes as actionable instructions, and then flag or neutralize any overlaps with untrusted data segments. To instantiate the framework, we develop an IIA that uses three "thinking intervention" strategies to elicit a structured list of intended instructions from reasoning-enabled LLMs. These techniques include start-of-thinking prefilling, end-of-thinking refinement, and adversarial in-context demonstration. We evaluate IntentGuard on two agentic benchmarks (AgentDojo and Mind2Web) using two reasoning-enabled LLMs (Qwen-3-32B and gpt-oss-20B). Results demonstrate that IntentGuard achieves (1) no utility degradation in all but one setting and (2) strong robustness against adaptive prompt injection attacks (e.g., reducing attack success rates from 100% to 8.5% in a Mind2Web scenario).

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fips and HFips methods for pattern sampling in numerical databases, addressing challenges with frequency and hyper-volume measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance information discovery by efficiently sampling interval patterns from large numerical databases while addressing the long-tail phenomenon.

Method: Developed Fips for frequency-proportional sampling and HFips for sampling proportional to frequency and hyper-volume, employing a multi-step sampling procedure.

Result: Experimentally proved the quality and robustness of sampled patterns with formal proofs supporting the methodology.

Conclusion: Fips and HFips provide robust methods for sampling interval patterns, improving handling of long-tail patterns in numerical data.

Abstract: Pattern sampling has emerged as a promising approach for information discovery in large databases, allowing analysts to focus on a manageable subset of patterns. In this approach, patterns are randomly drawn based on an interestingness measure, such as frequency or hyper-volume. This paper presents the first sampling approach designed to handle interval patterns in numerical databases. This approach, named Fips, samples interval patterns proportionally to their frequency. It uses a multi-step sampling procedure and addresses a key challenge in numerical data: accurately determining the number of interval patterns that cover each object. We extend this work with HFips, which samples interval patterns proportionally to both their frequency and hyper-volume. These methods efficiently tackle the well-known long-tail phenomenon in pattern sampling. We formally prove that Fips and HFips sample interval patterns in proportion to their frequency and the product of hyper-volume and frequency, respectively. Through experiments on several databases, we demonstrate the quality of the obtained patterns and their robustness against the long-tail phenomenon.

TL;DR: Loyalty programs face scalability and interoperability issues in AI-driven commerce due to their centralized architectures. This paper proposes a hybrid framework allowing cross-brand cooperation while preserving individual brand control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loyalty programs, despite their advancement, fail to scale and adapt in AI-driven ecosystems due to centralized models and structural issues. The need arises for a trustless mechanism enabling interoperability.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid framework combining sovereign brand control with trustless exchange mechanisms. It also develops a mathematical pricing model to ensure fair value exchange for interoperable rewards.

Result: The proposed framework overcomes structural failures of traditional coalition models, blending closed system advantages with open system benefits for scalable and trustless interoperability.

Conclusion: The framework addresses limitations of centralized loyalty program models, paving the way for scalable, fair, and interoperable ecosystems using trustless mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite their evolution from early copper-token schemes to sophisticated digital solutions, loyalty programs remain predominantly closed ecosystems, with brands retaining full control over all components. Coalition loyalty programs emerged to enable cross-brand interoperability, but approximately 60\% fail within 10 years in spite of theoretical advantages rooted in network economics. This paper demonstrates that coalition failures stem from fundamental architectural limitations in centralized operator models rather than operational deficiencies, and argues further that neither closed nor coalition systems can scale in intelligence-driven paradigms where AI agents mediate commerce and demand trustless, protocol-based coordination that existing architectures cannot provide. We propose a hybrid framework where brands maintain sovereign control over their programs while enabling cross-brand interoperability through trustless exchange mechanisms. Our framework preserves closed system advantages while enabling open system benefits without the structural problems that doom traditional coalitions. We derive a mathematical pricing model accounting for empirically-validated market factors while enabling fair value exchange across interoperable reward systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces xG+, a possession-level model to improve the prediction accuracy of goal probability by modeling shot-taking and shot quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current expected goals (xG) models are limited as they only account for observed shots, excluding other dynamics involved in possession that influence scoring probability.

Method: The proposed xG+ framework combines predictions for shot occurrence and shot quality, aggregated over possessions, to jointly model behavior and overall scoring chances.

Result: The xG+ model enhances predictive accuracy at the team level and identifies a more reliable signal for individual player skill compared to standard xG.

Conclusion: xG+ provides a better approach to studying goal probability by addressing limitations of traditional xG models, offering more comprehensive insights at both team and player levels.

Abstract: Expected goals (xG) models estimate the probability that a shot results in a goal from its context (e.g., location, pressure), but they operate only on observed shots. We propose xG+, a possession-level framework that first estimates the probability that a shot occurs within the next second and its corresponding xG if it were to occur. We also introduce ways to aggregate this joint probability estimate over the course of a possession. By jointly modeling shot-taking behavior and shot quality, xG+ remedies the conditioning-on-shots limitation of standard xG. We show that this improves predictive accuracy at the team level and produces a more persistent player skill signal than standard xG models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that uses structured biological knowledge and the reasoning capabilities of large language models to address limitations in existing virtual cell models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual cell models heavily rely on large-scale data, suffer from limited generalization, and lack interpretability, which diminishes their scientific reliability.

Method: VCWorld integrates biological knowledge with reasoning from large language models, enabling structured and stepwise predictions to simulate biological responses to perturbations.

Result: VCWorld achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy in drug perturbation benchmarks and produces predictions consistent with known biological evidence.

Conclusion: VCWorld addresses limitations of prior models by combining biological knowledge with interpretability, offering reliable and biologically consistent predictions for cellular responses.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling aims to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Existing virtual cell models rely heavily on large-scale single-cell datasets, learning explicit mappings between gene expression and perturbations. Although recent models attempt to incorporate multi-source biological information, their generalization remains constrained by data quality, coverage, and batch effects. More critically, these models often function as black boxes, offering predictions without interpretability or consistency with biological principles, which undermines their credibility in scientific research. To address these challenges, we present VCWorld, a cell-level white-box simulator that integrates structured biological knowledge with the iterative reasoning capabilities of large language models to instantiate a biological world model. VCWorld operates in a data-efficient manner to reproduce perturbation-induced signaling cascades and generates interpretable, stepwise predictions alongside explicit mechanistic hypotheses. In drug perturbation benchmarks, VCWorld achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and the inferred mechanistic pathways are consistent with publicly available biological evidence.

### [785] [Heuristic algorithms for the stochastic critical node detection problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01497)
*Tuguldur Bayarsaikhan,Altannar Chinchuluun,Ashwin Arulselvan,Panos Pardalos*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: This paper addresses the stochastic critical node detection problem, introducing heuristics and learning-based methods to handle networks with probabilistic edges. Experimental results validate the scalability and efficiency of these methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to assess network vulnerabilities, given their critical role in systems like transportation, epidemic control, and biological networks, particularly in stochastic settings where edges have probabilistic existence.

Method: The authors developed heuristic and learning-based approaches tailored for stochastic critical node detection and benchmarked them against existing algorithms using experimental setups with varying edge probabilities.

Result: The experiments, conducted on random graphs of different sizes and edge survival probability distributions, highlight the high scalability of heuristic methods and the consistent inference efficiency of learning-based approaches as network complexity increases.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively tackle the stochastic critical node detection problem, demonstrating scalability and efficiency across varied network conditions.

Abstract: Given a network, the critical node detection problem finds a subset of nodes whose removal disrupts the network connectivity. Since many real-world systems are naturally modeled as graphs, assessing the vulnerability of the network is essential, with applications in transportation systems, traffic forecasting, epidemic control, and biological networks. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the critical node detection problem, where the existence of edges is given by certain probabilities. We propose heuristics and learning-based methods for the problem and compare them with existing algorithms. Experimental results performed on random graphs from small to larger scales, with edge-survival probabilities drawn from different distributions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. Heuristic methods often illustrate the strongest results with high scalability, while learning-based methods maintain nearly constant inference time as the network size and density grow.

### [786] [Stochastic Dominance Constrained Optimization with S-shaped Utilities: Poor-Performance-Region Algorithm and Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00299)
*Zeyun Hu,Yang Liu*

Main category: q-fin.MF

TL;DR: This paper addresses S-shaped and non-concave utility maximization under stochastic dominance (SD) constraints, proposing solutions ranging from analytical approaches to numerical algorithms and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle portfolio selection problems under S-shaped and non-concave utilities with stochastic dominance constraints, aiming for effective risk management and optimal performance.

Method: The authors propose analytical solutions for S-shaped utility with first-order SD constraints, a numerical algorithm for second-order SD constraints, and a piecewise-neural-network framework for solution learning.

Result: The study demonstrates successful sub-optimal solutions for non-concave utilities using numerical approaches and improved convergence for second-order SD problems via a neural-network framework.

Conclusion: The paper provides tools for handling non-concave utility optimization under SD constraints, showcasing their effectiveness in managing poor performance scenarios while facilitating accelerated computation solutions.

Abstract: We investigate the static portfolio selection problem of S-shaped and non-concave utility maximization under first-order and second-order stochastic dominance (SD) constraints. In many S-shaped utility optimization problems, one should require a liquidation boundary to guarantee the existence of a finite concave envelope function. A first-order SD (FSD) constraint can replace this requirement and provide an alternative for risk management. We explicitly solve the optimal solution under a general S-shaped utility function with a first-order stochastic dominance constraint. However, the second-order SD (SSD) constrained problem under non-concave utilities is difficult to solve analytically due to the invalidity of Sion's maxmin theorem. For this sake, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain a plausible and sub-optimal solution for general non-concave utilities. The key idea is to detect the poor performance region with respect to the SSD constraints, characterize its structure and modify the distribution on that region to obtain (sub-)optimality. A key financial insight is that the decision maker should follow the SD constraint on the poor performance scenario while conducting the unconstrained optimal strategy otherwise. We provide numerical experiments to show that our algorithm effectively finds a sub-optimal solution in many cases. Finally, we develop an algorithm-guided piecewise-neural-network framework to learn the solution of the SSD problem, which demonstrates accelerated convergence compared to standard neural network approaches.

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm for large-scale binary classification, achieving enhanced convergence and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in solving large-scale binary classification problems by proposing an improved stochastic algorithm.

Method: Develop a hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm that combines natural Hessian estimation and stochastic gradient information.

Result: Proved the almost sure convergence of the algorithm, improved the convergence rate to the Hessian matrix, established a central limit theorem, and attained an unexpected result on cumulative excess risk.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm proves effective for large-scale binary classification by ensuring strong convergence properties and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a second-order stochastic algorithm for solving large-scale binary classification problems. We propose to make use of a new hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm that includes two weighted components in the Hessian matrix estimation: the first one coming from the natural Hessian estimate and the second associated with the stochastic gradient information. Our motivation comes from the fact that both parts evaluated at the true parameter of logistic regression, are equal to the Hessian matrix. This new formulation has several advantages and it enables us to prove the almost sure convergence of our stochastic algorithm to the true parameter. Moreover, we significantly improve the almost sure rate of convergence to the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, we establish the central limit theorem for our hybrid stochastic Newton algorithm. Finally, we show a surprising result on the almost sure convergence of the cumulative excess risk.

### [788] [On the Holographic Geometry of Deterministic Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00607)
*Logan Nye*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that simulations of Turing machines can be conducted in $O(\sqrt{t})$ space, far less than the apparent linear information requirements, using geometric and information-theoretic techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional perception that Turing machine simulations inherently require linear storage to verify or regenerate configurations over time, and explore more efficient representations.

Method: The paper uses a combination of the Height Compression Theorem, Algebraic Replay Engine, geometric interpretations, and Kolmogorov complexity to demonstrate that simulations can be conducted with summary data stored on boundaries rather than the entire spacetime bulk.

Result: A simulation method is presented that reduces storage requirements to $O(\sqrt{t})$ by treating the spacetime execution trace as a dependency DAG and compressing its information into boundary summaries.

Conclusion: This work establishes that deterministic computation can be simulated holographically, with the bulk computational history derivable from compact summary data on a boundary, akin to a computational area law.

Abstract: Standard simulations of Turing machines suggest a linear relationship between the temporal duration $t$ of a run and the amount of information that must be stored by known simulations to certify, verify, or regenerate the configuration at time $t$. For deterministic multitape Turing machines over a fixed finite alphabet, this apparent linear dependence is not intrinsic: any length-$t$ run can be simulated in space $O(\sqrt{t})$ via a Height Compression Theorem for succinct computation trees together with an Algebraic Replay Engine. In this paper we recast that construction in geometric and information-theoretic language. We interpret the execution trace as a spacetime dependency DAG and exhibit a family of recursively defined holographic boundary summaries such that, along the square-root-space simulation, the total description length of all boundary data stored at any time is $O(\sqrt{t})$. Using Kolmogorov complexity, we prove that every internal configuration has constant conditional description complexity given the appropriate boundary summary and time index, establishing that the spacetime bulk carries no additional algorithmic information beyond its boundary. We express this as a one-dimensional computational area law: there exists a simulation in which the information capacity of the active "holographic screen'' needed to generate a spacetime region of volume $t$ is bounded by $O(\sqrt{t})$. In this precise sense, deterministic computation on a one-dimensional work tape admits a holographic representation, with the bulk history algebraically determined by data residing on a lower-dimensional boundary screen.

### [789] [Efficient Turing Machine Simulation with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00003)
*Qian Li,Yuyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to efficiently simulate Turing Machines using constant bit-size Transformers with reduced chain-of-thought steps and proves their computational feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in simulating Turing Machines using Transformers that require a large number of chain-of-thought steps, making them impractical for universal computation tasks.

Method: An efficient simulation method is proposed using synchronous multi-queue Turing Machines as an intermediary, minimizing both time and space complexities. The approach uses sparse attention with fixed geometric offsets on Transformers.

Result: The authors demonstrate that constant bit-size Transformers can simulate Turing Machines with optimal context window size and significantly reduced chain-of-thought steps per Turing Machine step.

Conclusion: The findings confirm that constant bit-size Transformers are not only Turing complete but can achieve efficient universal computation using sparse attention and optimized simulation techniques.

Abstract: Constant bit-size Transformers are known to be Turing complete, but existing constructions require $Ω(s(n))$ chain-of-thought (CoT) steps per simulated Turing machine (TM) step, leading to impractical reasoning lengths. In this paper, we significantly reduce this efficiency gap by proving that any $(t(n),s(n))$-bounded multi-tape TM can be simulated by a constant bit-size Transformer with an optimal $O(s(n))$-long context window and only $O(s(n)^c)$ CoT steps per TM step, where $c>0$ can be made arbitrarily small by letting the Transformers' head-layer product sufficiently large. In addition, our construction shows that sparse attention with fixed geometric offsets suffices for efficient universal computation. Our proof leverages multi-queue TMs as a bridge. The main technical novelty is a more efficient simulation of multi-tape TMs by synchronous multi-queue TMs, improving both time and space complexity under stricter model assumptions.

### [790] [Samplability makes learning easier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01276)
*Guy Blanc,Caleb Koch,Jane Lange,Carmen Strassle,Li-Yang Tan*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper explores how samplable PAC learning expands the capability of learners compared to standard PAC learning, introducing 'explicit evasive sets' for their proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations posed by standard PAC learning, where learners must succeed under all distributions, including intractable ones, highlighting potential efficiency gains in samplable PAC learning.

Method: Constructing a concept class to demonstrate statistical differences in sample complexity between standard and samplable PAC. Introducing a complexity primitive, explicit evasive sets, and extending findings to the online learning setting.

Result: Samplable PAC learning was shown to enable polynomial sample complexity where standard PAC required exponential complexity. A computational separation relative to a random oracle was also demonstrated.

Conclusion: The paper redefines the potential of efficient learning by underlining the role of samplable distributions and expands the understanding of online learning under bounded adversarial settings.

Abstract: The standard definition of PAC learning (Valiant 1984) requires learners to succeed under all distributions -- even ones that are intractable to sample from. This stands in contrast to samplable PAC learning (Blum, Furst, Kearns, and Lipton 1993), where learners only have to succeed under samplable distributions. We study this distinction and show that samplable PAC substantially expands the power of efficient learners.
  We first construct a concept class that requires exponential sample complexity in standard PAC but is learnable with polynomial sample complexity in samplable PAC. We then lift this statistical separation to the computational setting and obtain a separation relative to a random oracle. Our proofs center around a new complexity primitive, explicit evasive sets, that we introduce and study. These are sets for which membership is easy to determine but are extremely hard to sample from.
  Our results extend to the online setting to similarly show how its landscape changes when the adversary is assumed to be efficient instead of computationally unbounded.

*Hasi Hays,Yue Yu,William Richardson*

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs), a novel AI model for biological systems that outperforms existing models in temporal signaling predictions within a cardiac fibroblast network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of traditional mathematical and statistical models in capturing complex, context-dependent, and dynamic signaling pathways across different biological scales.

Method: The authors propose Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs), which apply a specialized large language model (LLM) architecture with graph-structured attention mechanisms to model intracellular signaling as a molecular language. It integrates multiple biological scales and uses adapted transformer architectures.

Result: HMLMs demonstrated better performance than graph neural networks (GNNs) and ordinary differential equation models (ODEs) in predicting temporal signaling, achieving a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058, with higher efficacy under sparse temporal sampling conditions.

Conclusion: HMLMs serve as a foundational model for AI-driven systems biology, offering a scalable and precise framework for applications in precision medicine and therapeutic discovery in the AI era.

Abstract: Cellular signaling networks represent complex information processing systems that have been modeled via traditional mathematical or statistical approaches. However, these methods often struggle to capture context-dependent signaling, pathway cross-talk, and temporal dynamics across multiple biological scales. Here, we introduce hierarchical molecular language models (HMLMs), a novel architecture that proposes a molecular network-specific large language model (LLM) to use in intracellular communication as a specialized molecular language, which includes molecules as tokens, protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and regulatory events modeled as semantic relationships within an adapted transformer architecture. HMLMs employ graph-structured attention mechanisms to accommodate signaling network topology while integrating information across the molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention patterns. We demonstrate HMLM superiority using a cardiac fibroblast signaling network comprising over 100 molecular species across functional modules connected by regulatory edges. HMLM achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.058 for temporal signaling predictions, representing 30% improvement over graph neural networks (GNNs: 0.083) and 52% improvement over ordinary differential equation models (ODEs: 0.121), with particular advantages under sparse temporal sampling conditions where HMLM maintained MSE = 0.041 with only 4 time-points. The HMLMs offer a foundation for AI-driven biology and medicine with predictable scaling characteristics suitable for interactive applications. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs provide a powerful paradigm for systems biology that advances precision medicine applications and therapeutic discovery in the era of AI.

*Jiahua Wang,Shannan Yan,Leqi Zheng,Jialong Wu,Yaoxin Mao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first formal framework for Audio-Visual World Models (AVWM), integrating binaural spatial audio and visual dynamics to enhance agent performance in multimodal environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research and a formalized framework in integrating audio, a critical sensory modality, with visual dynamics in world models for better perception and reasoning of future states.

Method: The authors propose AV-CDiT, a novel conditional diffusion transformer framework, with a modality expert architecture trained via a three-stage strategy. They also create AVW-4k, a dataset of synchronized binaural audio-visual recordings for training, with action annotations and rewards.

Result: The model demonstrates high-fidelity multimodal predictions in both visual and auditory domains and enhances agent performance significantly in tasks like continuous audio-visual navigation.

Conclusion: This work formally defines and validates the integration of audio into world models, emphasizing the importance of multimodal environment simulation for improved agent navigation and understanding.

Abstract: World models simulate environmental dynamics to enable agents to plan and reason about future states. While existing approaches have primarily focused on visual observations, real-world perception inherently involves multiple sensory modalities. Audio provides crucial spatial and temporal cues such as sound source localization and acoustic scene properties, yet its integration into world models remains largely unexplored. No prior work has formally defined what constitutes an audio-visual world model or how to jointly capture binaural spatial audio and visual dynamics under precise action control with task reward prediction. This work presents the first formal framework for Audio-Visual World Models (AVWM), formulating multimodal environment simulation as a partially observable Markov decision process with synchronized audio-visual observations, fine-grained actions, and task rewards. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct AVW-4k, a dataset comprising 30 hours of binaural audio-visual trajectories with action annotations and reward signals across 76 indoor environments. We propose AV-CDiT, an Audio-Visual Conditional Diffusion Transformer with a novel modality expert architecture that balances visual and auditory learning, optimized through a three-stage training strategy for effective multimodal integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AV-CDiT achieves high-fidelity multimodal prediction across visual and auditory modalities with reward. Furthermore, we validate its practical utility in continuous audio-visual navigation tasks, where AVWM significantly enhances the agent's performance.

*Heng Xie,Kang Zhu,Zhengqi Wen,Jianhua Tao,Xuefei Liu,Ruibo Fu,Changsheng Li*

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis by integrating personality traits in feature extraction and proposing a multi-level fusion framework, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve sentiment analysis accuracy by resolving issues in unimodal feature extraction and multimodal feature fusion, which fail to consider personality traits and feature differences.

Method: The authors introduce personality traits for creating personalized sentiment embeddings from textual data. They propose a multi-level fusion strategy that gradually merges textual, visual, and audio sentiments through pre-fusion and enhanced fusion processes.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods, delivering state-of-the-art results on two widely-used sentiment analysis datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating personality traits and a novel multi-level fusion approach improves sentiment recognition accuracy by addressing shortcomings in existing unimodal and multimodal analysis methods.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is a research field that recognizes human sentiments by combining textual, visual, and audio modalities. The main challenge lies in integrating sentiment-related information from different modalities, which typically arises during the unimodal feature extraction phase and the multimodal feature fusion phase. Existing methods extract only shallow information from unimodal features during the extraction phase, neglecting sentimental differences across different personalities. During the fusion phase, they directly merge the feature information from each modality without considering differences at the feature level. This ultimately affects the model's recognition performance. To address this problem, we propose a personality-sentiment aligned multi-level fusion framework. We introduce personality traits during the feature extraction phase and propose a novel personality-sentiment alignment method to obtain personalized sentiment embeddings from the textual modality for the first time. In the fusion phase, we introduce a novel multi-level fusion method. This method gradually integrates sentimental information from textual, visual, and audio modalities through multimodal pre-fusion and a multi-level enhanced fusion strategy. Our method has been evaluated through multiple experiments on two commonly used datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Zhijian Yang,Edwin Setiadi Sugeng,Mhedine Alicherif,Tat Loon Chng*

Main category: physics.plasm-ph

TL;DR: This study introduces Decoder-DeepONet (DDON), a machine learning model designed to address limitations in the inverse EFISH problem, showing superior performance in reconstructing electric field distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inaccuracies in EFISH signal profiles caused by the Gouy phase shift and improve electric field reconstruction through advanced machine learning approaches.

Method: The study introduces the DDON, an advanced machine learning model based on operator-learning architecture, which can map functions to functions, making it suitable for reconstructing electric fields. The model's performance is validated by comparisons to CNN models, a mathematical method, simulations, and experimental data.

Result: The results demonstrate that the DDON model outperforms previous CNN models in generalizability, accuracy, and applicability. It can reconstruct electric field distributions even from incomplete data and provides insights into optimal sampling regions through Integrated Gradients.

Conclusion: The DDON model is a versatile and reliable tool for reconstructing electric fields, especially in non-equilibrium plasmas, addressing challenges like incomplete inputs and guiding signal sampling effectively.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have recently been used to reconstruct electric field distributions from EFISH signal profiles-the 'inverse EFISH problem'. This addresses the line-of-sight EFISH inaccuracy caused by the Gouy phase shift in focused beams. A key benefit of this approach is that the accuracy of the reconstructed profile can be directly checked via a 'forward transform' of the EFISH equation. Motivated by this latest success, the present study introduces a novel ML model with markedly improved performance. Based on a more powerful operator-learning architecture, it goes beyond the ANNs and CNNs employed previously. Termed Decoder-DeepONet (DDON), its main strength is learning function-to-function mappings, essential for recovering electric field profiles of unknown shape. The superior performance of DDON is exemplified via a comparison with our published CNN model and the feasibility of a classical mathematical method, as well as its application to both discharge simulations and experimental EFISH data from a nanosecond pulsed discharge. In almost all cases, the DDON model exhibits better generalizability, higher prediction accuracy, and wider applicability. Furthermore, the intrinsic nature of this operator-learning architecture renders it less sensitive to the exact location(s) of the acquired data, enabling electric field reconstruction even with seemingly 'incomplete' input profiles--an issue often accompanying poor signal sensitivity. We also employ Integrated Gradients (IG) to identify the signal regions most critical to reconstruction accuracy, providing guidance on the optimal sampling window for EFISH acquisition. Overall, we believe that the DDON model is a robust and comprehensive model which can be readily applied to reconstruct 'bell-shaped' electric field profiles with an existing axis of symmetry, especially in non-equilibrium plasmas.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving accurate and efficient estimation of Worst-Case Deadline Failure Probability (WCDFP) in safety-critical systems by revising critical instant assumptions and enhancing convolution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational inefficiencies and inaccuracies in estimating WCDFP for safety-critical real-time systems, given the shortcomings of the traditional critical instant assumption in probabilistic analysis.

Method: The paper introduces optimized convolution-based methods under a revised critical instant formulation and proposes an algorithm for improving the merge order in convolution processes.

Result: The proposed optimized Aggregate Convolution reduces computation time by up to an order of magnitude compared to prior methods like Sequential Convolution, while maintaining accuracy and safety.

Conclusion: The approach offers both computational efficiency and reliability, making it practical for probabilistic timing analysis in safety-critical real-time applications.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the Worst-Case Deadline Failure Probability (WCDFP) has attracted growing attention as a means to provide safety assurances in complex systems such as robotic platforms and autonomous vehicles. WCDFP quantifies the likelihood of deadline misses under the most pessimistic operating conditions, and safe estimation is essential for dependable real-time applications. However, achieving high accuracy in WCDFP estimation often incurs significant computational cost. Recent studies have revealed that the classical assumption of the critical instant, the activation pattern traditionally considered to trigger the worst-case behavior, can lead to underestimation of WCDFP in probabilistic settings. This observation motivates the use of a revised critical instant formulation that more faithfully captures the true worst-case scenario. This paper investigates convolution-based methods for WCDFP estimation under this revised setting and proposes an optimization technique that accelerates convolution by improving the merge order. Extensive experiments with diverse execution-time distributions demonstrate that the proposed optimized Aggregate Convolution reduces computation time by up to an order of magnitude compared to Sequential Convolution, while retaining accurate and safe-sided WCDFP estimates. These results highlight the potential of the approach to provide both efficiency and reliability in probabilistic timing analysis for safety-critical real-time applications.

TL;DR: This paper develops personalized dosing frameworks for HD-tDCS in children, addressing age, sex, and anatomical variability in head models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HD-tDCS dosing for children lacks customization, ignoring developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties, leading to inconsistent brain-current modulation.

Method: Using 70 pediatric head models, the paper applies forward simulations and introduces a dual-objective optimization framework, creating personalized solutions to balance electric-field intensity and focality.

Result: It identifies age and sex-based dosing limitations, provides optimized dosing strategies, analyzes conductivity sensitivity, and derives sparse solutions without performance loss.

Conclusion: The study offers tailored dosing strategies for pediatric HD-tDCS, ensuring reliable and individualized neuromodulation by accounting for anatomical and physiological variability.

Abstract: High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) dosing in children remains largely empirical, relying on one-size-fits-all protocols despite rapid developmental changes in head anatomy and tissue properties that strongly modulate how currents reach the developing brain. Using 70 pediatric head models and commonly used cortical targets, our forward simulations find that standard montages produce marked age-dependent reductions in target electric-field intensity and systematic sex differences linked to tissue-volume covariation, underscoring the profound limitations of conventional uniform montages. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a developmentally informed, dual-objective optimization framework designed to generate personalized Pareto fronts summarizing the trade-off between electric-field intensity and focality. From these optimized solutions, we derive two practical dosing prescriptions: a dose-consistency strategy that, for the first time, enforces fixed target intensity across individuals to implicitly mitigate demographic effects, and a target-engagement strategy that maximizes target intensity under safety limits. Both strategies remain robust to large conductivity variations, and we further show that dense HD-tDCS solutions admit sparse equivalents without performance loss under the target-engagement strategy. We also find that tissue conductivity sensitivity is depth-dependent, with Pareto-front distributions for superficial cortical targets most influenced by gray matter, scalp, and bone conductivities, and those for a deep target predominantly shaped by gray and white matter conductivities. Together, these results establish a principled framework for pediatric HD-tDCS planning that explicitly accounts for developmental anatomy and physiological uncertainty, enabling reliable and individualized neuromodulation dosing in pediatric populations.

TL;DR: The paper presents RadDiff, a novel protein inverse folding method leveraging evolutionary-informed priors and efficient retrieval strategies for improved sequence recovery and foldability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protein inverse folding methods overlook evolutionary data or are inefficient and inflexible in terms of scaling with protein databases, creating a need for improved algorithms.

Method: RadDiff retrieves structurally similar proteins from large databases, aligns residues to construct evolutionary-informed profiles, and incorporates this prior using a lightweight integration module in its denoising diffusion process.

Result: RadDiff demonstrates up to 19% improvement in sequence recovery rates and effectiveness in generating highly foldable protein sequences across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: RadDiff surpasses existing approaches in accuracy and scalability, offering a robust solution to address challenges in computational protein engineering.

Abstract: Protein inverse folding, the design of an amino acid sequence based on a target 3D structure, is a fundamental problem of computational protein engineering. Existing methods either generate sequences without leveraging external knowledge or relying on protein language models (PLMs). The former omits the evolutionary information stored in protein databases, while the latter is parameter-inefficient and inflexible to adapt to ever-growing protein data. To overcome the above drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel method, called retrieval-augmented denoising diffusion (RadDiff), for protein inverse folding. Given the target protein backbone, RadDiff uses a hierarchical search strategy to efficiently retrieve structurally similar proteins from large protein databases. The retrieved structures are then aligned residue-by-residue to the target to construct a position-specific amino acid profile, which serves as an evolutionary-informed prior that conditions the denoising process. A lightweight integration module is further designed to incorporate this prior effectively. Experimental results on the CATH, PDB, and TS50 datasets show that RadDiff consistently outperforms existing methods, improving sequence recovery rate by up to 19%. Experimental results also demonstrate that RadDiff generates highly foldable sequences and scales effectively with database size.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how leveraging embeddings from all layers, rather than only the final layer, can improve biologically meaningful analyses and predictions in protein studies.

Method: The researchers systematically evaluated all 33 layers of ESM-2 using unsupervised clustering and supervised classification methods for kinase function prediction.

Result: Mid-to-late layers (20-33) showed 32% better unsupervised clustering performance and achieved a homology-aware supervised accuracy of 75.7%, outperforming the final layer.

Conclusion: Using embeddings from specific transformer layers instead of relying solely on the final layer can enhance predictive accuracy and uncover distinct biological signals for protein-related tasks.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have transformed sequence-based protein analysis, yet most applications rely only on final-layer embeddings, which may overlook biologically meaningful information encoded in earlier layers. We systematically evaluate all 33 layers of ESM-2 for kinase functional prediction using both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification. We show that mid-to-late transformer layers (layers 20-33) outperform the final layer by 32 percent in unsupervised Adjusted Rand Index and improve homology-aware supervised accuracy to 75.7 percent. Domain-level extraction, calibrated probability estimates, and a reproducible benchmarking pipeline further strengthen reliability. Our results demonstrate that transformer depth contains functionally distinct biological signals and that principled layer selection significantly improves kinase function prediction.

*Yifei Chen,Eric Liang*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper proposes using wastewater data combined with other factors to estimate daily COVID-19 case counts using deep neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As COVID-19 becomes endemic, there is a need to monitor its prevalence reliably without invasive methods.

Method: The study creates a deep neural network model trained on COVID-19 testing data and wastewater surveillance data from periods of known reliability.

Result: The model learns a nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 case counts and viral RNA concentrations in wastewater.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising way to noninvasively monitor COVID-19 prevalence, addressing temporal reliability challenges in the data.

Abstract: As COVID-19 transitions into an endemic disease that remains constantly present in the population at a stable level, monitoring its prevalence without invasive measures becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we present a deep neural network estimator for the COVID-19 daily case count based on wastewater surveillance data and other confounding factors. This work builds upon the study by Jiang, Kolozsvary, and Li (2024), which connects the COVID-19 case counts with testing data collected early in the pandemic. Using the COVID-19 testing data and the wastewater surveillance data during the period when both data were highly reliable, one can train an artificial neural network that learns the nonlinear relation between the COVID-19 daily case count and the wastewater viral RNA concentration. From a machine learning perspective, the main challenge lies in addressing temporal feature reliability, as the training data has different reliability over different time periods.

*Dominik Luszczynski,Richard Fei Yin,Nicholas Afonin,Andrew S. P. Lim*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper evaluates a Mamba-based deep learning model for diagnosing sleep-disordered breathing using data from the ANNE One wearable system, achieving high accuracy and specificity for detecting respiratory events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve non-intrusive, accurate diagnosis and characterization of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using advanced deep learning techniques and wearable devices.

Method: The study used recordings from 384 adults with concurrent PSG and wearable sensor data. Data alignment was performed with ECG signals, and a Mamba-based deep sequential neural network was trained using manually-annotated respiratory events from PSG data.

Result: The model demonstrated strong correlation with PSG-derived AHI (R=0.95), high sensitivity and specificity for AHI threshold detection (>5 and >15), and accurate detection of respiratory events (sensitivity of 0.93, specificity of 0.95). Performance was robust across age and sex.

Conclusion: The Mamba-based model effectively predicts AHI, identifies respiratory events, and shows potential for detailed SDB event characterization, using data from a non-intrusive wearable device.

Abstract: Objectives: We present and evaluate a Mamba-based deep-learning model for diagnosis and event-level characterization of sleep disordered breathing based on signals from the ANNE One, a non-intrusive dual-module wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography, triaxial accelerometry, chest and finger temperature, and finger phototplethysmography.
  Methods: We obtained concurrent PSG and wearable sensor recordings from 384 adults attending a tertiary care sleep laboratory. Respiratory events in the PSG were manually annotated in accordance with AASM guidelines. Wearable sensor and PSG recordings were automatically aligned based on the ECG signal, alignment confirmed by visual inspection, and PSG-derived respiratory event labels were used to train and evaluate a deep sequential neural network based on the Mamba architecture.
  Results: In 57 recordings in our test set (mean age 56, mean AHI 10.8, 43.86\% female) the model-predicted AHI was highly correlated with that derived form the PSG labels (R=0.95, p=8.3e-30, men absolute error 2.83). This performance did not vary with age or sex. At a threshold of AHI$>$5, the model had a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.87, and kappa of 0.82, and at a threshold of AHI$>$15, the model had a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.98, and kappa of 0.85. At the level of 30-sec epochs, the model had a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95, with a kappa of 0.68 regarding whether any given epoch contained a respiratory event.
  Conclusions: Applied to data from the ANNE One, a Mamba-based deep learning model can accurately predict AHI and identify SDB at clinically relevant thresholds, achieves good epoch- and event-level identification of individual respiratory events, and shows promise at physiological characterization of these events including event type (central vs. other) and event duration.

*Nasim Montazeri,Stone Yang,Dominik Luszczynski,John Zhang,Dharmendra Gurve,Andrew Centen,Maged Goubran,Andrew Lim*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper develops a deep learning model for sleep-wake detection using wrist accelerometry, achieving generalizability across devices and robustness to sleep disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor wake detection and lack of cross-device generalizability in current wrist accelerometry-based sleep-wake detection methods, especially across various populations with different ages and sleep disorders.

Method: A deep learning model was trained on triaxial accelerometry data in a large adult population (453 adults) undergoing simultaneous polysomnography. The training included features from devices across three models with adjustments for individuals with low sleep efficiency or high arousal indexes. Wake and sleep classifications were performed using a decision tree approach.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance with an F1 score of 0.86, sleep sensitivity of 0.87, wake specificity of 0.78, and moderate correlations to polysomnography for total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Performance remained consistent across devices and was robust to sleep disorders.

Conclusion: The deep learning approach offers a robust and generalized methodology for detecting sleep-wake states using wrist accelerometers, overcoming limitations of earlier models and maintaining accuracy across different devices and populations with or without sleep disorders.

Abstract: Study Objectives: Wrist accelerometry is widely used for inferring sleep-wake state. Previous works demonstrated poor wake detection, without cross-device generalizability and validation in different age range and sleep disorders. We developed a robust deep learning model for to detect sleep-wakefulness from triaxial accelerometry and evaluated its validity across three devices and in a large adult population spanning a wide range of ages with and without sleep disorders. Methods: We collected wrist accelerometry simultaneous to polysomnography (PSG) in 453 adults undergoing clinical sleep testing at a tertiary care sleep laboratory, using three devices. We extracted features in 30-second epochs and trained a 3-class model to detect wake, sleep, and sleep with arousals, which was then collapsed into wake vs. sleep using a decision tree. To enhance wake detection, the model was specifically trained on randomly selected subjects with low sleep efficiency and/or high arousal index from one device recording and then tested on the remaining recordings. Results: The model showed high performance with F1 Score of 0.86, sensitivity (sleep) of 0.87, and specificity (wakefulness) of 0.78, and significant and moderate correlation to PSG in predicting total sleep time (R=0.69) and sleep efficiency (R=0.63). Model performance was robust to the presence of sleep disorders, including sleep apnea and periodic limb movements in sleep, and was consistent across all three models of accelerometer. Conclusions: We present a deep model to detect sleep-wakefulness from actigraphy in adults with relative robustness to the presence of sleep disorders and generalizability across diverse commonly used wrist accelerometers.

*Alex Oshin,Rahul Vodeb Ghosh,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlexQP, a versatile quadratic programming solver, which adapts to feasible and infeasible constraints, and its accelerated version, Deep FlexQP, leveraging data-driven learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing quadratic programming solvers in handling both feasible and infeasible constraints while ensuring scalability and robustness.

Method: Introduced FlexQP based on exact relaxation of constraints for feasibility handling and optimized its performance through deep unfolding techniques in Deep FlexQP. PAC Bayes generalization bounds were used for performance guarantees and solver design.

Result: FlexQP and Deep FlexQP demonstrated superior performance in handling quadratic programming problems across benchmarks like portfolio optimization, classification, and regression. It also improved runtime and solution accuracy in nonlinear optimal control problems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is a robust, scalable, and high-performing solution for quadratic programming and nonlinear programming applications, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose an always-feasible quadratic programming (QP) optimizer, FlexQP, which is based on an exact relaxation of the QP constraints. If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs.

*Jimin Choi,Max Z. Li*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive Robust Markov Decision Process (RMDP) for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) in contested ISR missions, offering better adaptability and safety compared to static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments by addressing the limitations of static RMDP ambiguity sets.

Method: The authors introduce an adaptive RMDP framework for CCAs, modeling adversarial tactics with a finite set of transition kernels and incrementally refining policies as threat models are eliminated.

Result: The adaptive RMDP achieves higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events than static or nominal planners in experiments using various threat models and network topologies.

Conclusion: The adaptive RMDP framework provides better adaptability, safety, and performance for CCAs in hostile ISR missions, while offering theoretical guarantees of robustness and convergence.

Abstract: Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) are envisioned to enable autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments, where adversaries may act strategically to deceive or evade detection. These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.

*Jihang Li,Bing Xu,Zulong Chen,Chuanfei Xu,Minping Chen,Suyu Liu,Ying Zhou,Zeyi Wen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel recruitment framework using LLMs and role-aware multi-gate MoE network along with multi-task learning module to optimize recruitment metrics, achieving significant business improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern recruitment systems are limited by their inability to effectively capture job-specific preferences, fine-grained recruiter behavior, and mitigate noise from subjective judgments.

Method: The framework uses LLMs for extracting fine-grained recruitment signals and implements a role-aware multi-gate MoE network to model recruiter role behavior. A multi-task learning module optimizes CTR, CVR, and resume relevance.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show 1.70% AUC gain for CTR, 5.97% AUC gain for CVR, a 17.29% lift in conversion rates, and significant cost savings in recruitment.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance talent search effectiveness, mitigate external sourcing dependence, and deliver measurable business value in recruitment systems.

Abstract: Talent search is a cornerstone of modern recruitment systems, yet existing approaches often struggle to capture nuanced job-specific preferences, model recruiter behavior at a fine-grained level, and mitigate noise from subjective human judgments. We present a novel framework that enhances talent search effectiveness and delivers substantial business value through two key innovations: (i) leveraging LLMs to extract fine-grained recruitment signals from job descriptions and historical hiring data, and (ii) employing a role-aware multi-gate MoE network to capture behavioral differences across recruiter roles. To further reduce noise, we introduce a multi-task learning module that jointly optimizes click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), and resume matching relevance. Experiments on real-world recruitment data and online A/B testing show relative AUC gains of 1.70% (CTR) and 5.97% (CVR), and a 17.29% lift in click-through conversion rate. These improvements reduce dependence on external sourcing channels, enabling an estimated annual cost saving of millions of CNY.

TL;DR: SAFE, a system utilizing large language models with retrieval-augmented generation, improves the accuracy and reliability of long-form COVID-19 misinformation fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the urgent need for scalable, accurate fact-checking systems for long-form misinformation during the COVID-19 infodemic.

Method: The study developed SAFE, comprising two agents for claim extraction and verification, leveraging the LOTR-RAG framework and a COVID-19 research corpus. An improved version incorporates SRAG for query refinement.

Result: SAFE outperformed baseline models in consistency, usefulness, clearness, and authenticity metrics. The LOTR-RAG system was more effective than its SRAG-augmented counterpart in overall performance.

Conclusion: SAFE offers significant advancements in automated long-form fact-checking, with the LOTR-RAG's core design being a robust foundation for scalable misinformation mitigation.

Abstract: The COVID-19 infodemic calls for scalable fact-checking solutions that handle long-form misinformation with accuracy and reliability. This study presents SAFE (system for accurate fact extraction and evaluation), an agent system that combines large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve automated fact-checking of long-form COVID-19 misinformation. SAFE includes two agents - one for claim extraction and another for claim verification using LOTR-RAG, which leverages a 130,000-document COVID-19 research corpus. An enhanced variant, SAFE (LOTR-RAG + SRAG), incorporates Self-RAG to refine retrieval via query rewriting. We evaluated both systems on 50 fake news articles (2-17 pages) containing 246 annotated claims (M = 4.922, SD = 3.186), labeled as true (14.1%), partly true (14.4%), false (27.0%), partly false (2.2%), and misleading (21.0%) by public health professionals. SAFE systems significantly outperformed baseline LLMs in all metrics (p < 0.001). For consistency (0-1 scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) scored 0.629, exceeding both SAFE (+SRAG) (0.577) and the baseline (0.279). In subjective evaluations (0-4 Likert scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) also achieved the highest average ratings in usefulness (3.640), clearness (3.800), and authenticity (3.526). Adding SRAG slightly reduced overall performance, except for a minor gain in clearness. SAFE demonstrates robust improvements in long-form COVID-19 fact-checking by addressing LLM limitations in consistency and explainability. The core LOTR-RAG design proved more effective than its SRAG-augmented variant, offering a strong foundation for scalable misinformation mitigation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces two semantic chunking methods, PSC and MFC, to improve context retrieval and generation quality in RAG systems, showing substantial improvements in retrieval and generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for more precise document chunking methods arises from the limitations of conventional fixed-length and recursive splitters in preserving semantic structure, which directly impacts the retrieval-augmented generation quality.

Method: Two semantic chunking methods, Projected Similarity Chunking (PSC) and Metric Fusion Chunking (MFC), were developed and trained using PubMed data with three embedding models. An evaluation framework was created to measure the influence of chunking on retrieval and generation performance using PubMedQA datasets.

Result: Substantial retrieval improvements were achieved, especially with PSC (24x improvement in MRR), along with higher Hits@k scores on PubMedQA. PSC and MFC demonstrated strong out-of-domain generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Semantic chunking significantly enhances retrieval and generation performance in RAG systems, with PSC proving superior in both effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: Document chunking is a crucial component of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as it directly affects the retrieval of relevant and precise context. Conventional fixed-length and recursive splitters often produce arbitrary, incoherent segments that fail to preserve semantic structure. Although semantic chunking has gained traction, its influence on generation quality remains underexplored. This paper introduces two efficient semantic chunking methods, Projected Similarity Chunking (PSC) and Metric Fusion Chunking (MFC), trained on PubMed data using three different embedding models. We further present an evaluation framework that measures the effect of chunking on both retrieval and generation by augmenting PubMedQA with full-text PubMed Central articles. Our results show substantial retrieval improvements (24x with PSC) in MRR and higher Hits@k on PubMedQA. We provide a comprehensive analysis, including statistical significance and response-time comparisons with common chunking libraries. Despite being trained on a single domain, PSC and MFC also generalize well, achieving strong out-of-domain generation performance across multiple datasets. Overall, our findings confirm that our semantic chunkers, especially PSC, consistently deliver superior performance.

*Xiaoshan Yu,Ziwei Huang,Shangshang Yang,Ziwen Wang,Haiping Ma,Xingyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces one-shot adaptive testing (OAT) to address limitations of computerized adaptive testing (CAT), especially in high-cost interaction or sensitive scenarios, and proposes PEOAT, a novel optimization framework to efficiently select optimal test items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAT faces challenges in real-time and high-cost interaction scenarios or sensitive domains like psychological evaluations. The authors aim to improve adaptive testing to address these limitations.

Method: The authors propose PEOAT, a framework for OAT that uses a personalization-aware initialization strategy and cognitive-enhanced evolutionary optimization, including schema-preserving crossover, cognitively guided mutation, and diversity-aware environmental selection.

Result: PEOAT was validated through experiments on two datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and uncovering insights via case studies.

Conclusion: PEOAT significantly improves one-shot adaptive testing by efficiently and accurately selecting optimal items, making it suitable for time-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of intelligent education, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has attracted increasing attention by integrating educational psychology with deep learning technologies. Unlike traditional paper-and-pencil testing, CAT aims to efficiently and accurately assess examinee abilities by adaptively selecting the most suitable items during the assessment process. However, its real-time and sequential nature presents limitations in practical scenarios, particularly in large-scale assessments where interaction costs are high, or in sensitive domains such as psychological evaluations where minimizing noise and interference is essential. These challenges constrain the applicability of conventional CAT methods in time-sensitive or resourceconstrained environments. To this end, we first introduce a novel task called one-shot adaptive testing (OAT), which aims to select a fixed set of optimal items for each test-taker in a one-time selection. Meanwhile, we propose PEOAT, a Personalization-guided Evolutionary question assembly framework for One-shot Adaptive Testing from the perspective of combinatorial optimization. Specifically, we began by designing a personalization-aware initialization strategy that integrates differences between examinee ability and exercise difficulty, using multi-strategy sampling to construct a diverse and informative initial population. Building on this, we proposed a cognitive-enhanced evolutionary framework incorporating schema-preserving crossover and cognitively guided mutation to enable efficient exploration through informative signals. To maintain diversity without compromising fitness, we further introduced a diversity-aware environmental selection mechanism. The effectiveness of PEOAT is validated through extensive experiments on two datasets, complemented by case studies that uncovered valuable insights.

*Jiahao Tian,Zhenkai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel recommender system framework that refines noisy, high-dimensional multi-modal features from Large Language Models (LLMs) by deeply integrating collaborative and multi-modal knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems struggle with high-dimensional and noisy multi-modal features from LLMs, as these are statically used and decoupled from core recommendation tasks.

Method: The paper develops a unified architecture with two core techniques: integrating dimensionality reduction into the recommendation model for end-to-end co-training, and using a contrastive learning objective to incorporate collaborative filtering signals into the latent space.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance through the refined embeddings that effectively denoise and amplify task-relevant signals, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Effectively fusing and denoising LLM-generated features within the recommendation process is essential to advancing recommender systems' performance and establishing a foundational paradigm.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems struggle to effectively utilize the rich, yet high-dimensional and noisy, multi-modal features generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Treating these features as static inputs decouples them from the core recommendation task. We address this limitation with a novel framework built on a key insight: deeply fusing multi-modal and collaborative knowledge for representation denoising. Our unified architecture introduces two primary technical innovations. First, we integrate dimensionality reduction directly into the recommendation model, enabling end-to-end co-training that makes the reduction process aware of the final ranking objective. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the collaborative filtering signal into the latent space. This synergistic process refines raw LLM embeddings, filtering noise while amplifying task-relevant signals. Extensive experiments confirm our method's superior discriminative power, proving that this integrated fusion and denoising strategy is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our work provides a foundational paradigm for effectively harnessing LLMs in recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle retrieval quality challenges in RAG systems, address expertise-intensive design processes, reduce processing latency, and improve multilingual performance while increasing accuracy and reliability.

Method: SHRAG employs an LLM as a Query Strategist to create structured queries, uses Boolean retrieval for precision, and applies multilingual query expansion and embeddings for efficient cross-lingual question answering.

Result: SHRAG enhances accuracy and reliability in RAG systems, and supports efficient multilingual information retrieval and direct query responses.

Conclusion: SHRAG improves RAG performance, moving towards a reliable paradigm for direct and precise search, addressing key drawbacks in existing methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is gaining recognition as one of the key technological axes for next generation information retrieval, owing to its ability to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon in Large Language
  Models (LLMs)and effectively incorporate up-to-date information. However, specialized expertise is necessary to
  construct ahigh-quality retrieval system independently; moreover, RAGdemonstratesrelativelyslowerprocessing
  speeds compared to conventional pure retrieval systems because it involves both retrieval and generation stages.
  Accordingly, this study proposes SHRAG, a novel framework designed to facilitate the seamless integration of
  Information Retrieval and RAG while simultaneously securing precise retrieval performance. SHRAG utilizes a
  Large Language Model as a Query Strategist to automatically transform unstructured natural language queries
  into logically structured search queries, subsequently performing Boolean retrieval to emulate the search process
  of an expert human searcher. Furthermore, it incorporates multilingual query expansion and a multilingual
  embedding model, enabling it to perform efficient cross-lingual question answering within the multilingual
  dataset environment of the ScienceON Challenge. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method,
  combining logical retrieval capabilities and generative reasoning, can significantly enhance the accuracy and
  reliability of RAG systems. Furthermore, SHRAG movesbeyondconventionaldocument-centric retrieval methods,
  presenting the potential for a new search paradigm capable of providing direct and reliable responses to queries.

TL;DR: The paper examines relevance ranking in search systems, proposing reinforcement learning-based reasoning to enhance interpretability and performance, with successful deployment in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current relevance models are limited in interpretability and ability to handle complex signals. Generative Relevance Models lack generalization due to reliance on supervised fine-tuning and overly generic free-form reasoning.

Method: The authors formulate relevance modeling as a reasoning task, incorporating business-specific criteria through multi-step reasoning and Stepwise Advantage Masking (SAM) for better credit assignment. They introduce a reinforcement learning framework and distill the model for real-world deployment.

Result: The proposed solution demonstrated effectiveness through extensive industrial dataset experiments and online A/B tests.

Conclusion: Incorporating explicit reasoning and RL-based techniques into relevance modeling can improve interpretability, generalization, and effectiveness of search systems in practical applications.

Abstract: Ranking relevance is a fundamental task in search engines, aiming to identify the items most relevant to a given user query. Traditional relevance models typically produce scalar scores or directly predict relevance labels, limiting both interpretability and the modeling of complex relevance signals. Inspired by recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for complex tasks, we investigate whether explicit reasoning can enhance both interpretability and performance in relevance modeling. However, existing reasoning-based Generative Relevance Models (GRMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning on large amounts of human-annotated or synthetic CoT data, which often leads to limited generalization. Moreover, domain-agnostic, free-form reasoning tends to be overly generic and insufficiently grounded, limiting its potential to handle the diverse and ambiguous cases prevalent in open-domain search. In this work, we formulate relevance modeling in Xiaohongshu search as a reasoning task and introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework to enhance the grounded reasoning capabilities of GRMs. Specifically, we incorporate practical business-specific relevance criteria into the multi-step reasoning prompt design and propose Stepwise Advantage Masking (SAM), a lightweight process-supervision strategy which facilitates effective learning of these criteria through improved credit assignment. To enable industrial deployment, we further distill the large-scale RL-tuned model to a lightweight version suitable for real-world search systems. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets, along with online A/B tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: Conducts a comprehensive literature review, classifies CVR models into six categories, analyzes advantages and disadvantages of each, discusses performance on datasets, and identifies future prospects.

Result: Presents frameworks and evaluations for CVR prediction models, and notes inconsistencies in past performance evaluations. Highlights promising directions including semantics-enriched, attribution-enhanced, debiased models, and joint CTR and CVR prediction approaches.

Conclusion: Provides valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners by organizing the body of knowledge in CVR prediction, offering a foundation for future advancements.

Abstract: Conversion and conversion rate (CVR) prediction play a critical role in efficient advertising decision-making. In past decades, although researchers have developed plenty of models for CVR prediction, the methodological evolution and relationships between different techniques have been precluded. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on CVR prediction in online advertising, and classify state-of-the-art CVR prediction models into six categories with respect to the underlying techniques and elaborate on connections between these techniques. For each category of models, we present the framework of underlying techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, and discuss how they are utilized for CVR prediction. Moreover, we summarize the performance of various CVR prediction models on public and proprietary datasets. Finally, we identify research trends, major challenges, and promising future directions. We observe that results of performance evaluation reported in prior studies are not unanimous; semantics-enriched, attribution-enhanced, debiased CVR prediction and jointly modeling CTR and CVR prediction would be promising directions to explore in the future. This review is expected to provide valuable references and insights for future researchers and practitioners in this area.

Conclusion: Bench-CTR facilitates model evaluation and development, providing valuable tools and insights for CTR prediction research.

Abstract: This research designs a unified architecture of CTR prediction benchmark (Bench-CTR) platform that offers flexible interfaces with datasets and components of a wide range of CTR prediction models. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive system of evaluation protocols encompassing real-world and synthetic datasets, a taxonomy of metrics, standardized procedures and experimental guidelines for calibrating the performance of CTR prediction models. Furthermore, we implement the proposed benchmark platform and conduct a comparative study to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art models from traditional multivariate statistical to modern large language model (LLM)-based approaches on three public datasets and two synthetic datasets. Experimental results reveal that, (1) high-order models largely outperform low-order models, though such advantage varies in terms of metrics and on different datasets; (2) LLM-based models demonstrate a remarkable data efficiency, i.e., achieving the comparable performance to other models while using only 2% of the training data; (3) the performance of CTR prediction models has achieved significant improvements from 2015 to 2016, then reached a stage with slow progress, which is consistent across various datasets. This benchmark is expected to facilitate model development and evaluation and enhance practitioners' understanding of the underlying mechanisms of models in the area of CTR prediction.

### [813] [Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372)
*Wei Yang,Rui Zhong,Yiqun Chen,Chi Lu,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework called Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) for multimodal recommendation, targeting challenges like modality-specific noise and semantic inconsistency. It leverages advanced spectral decomposition, masking, reasoning, and contrastive regularization to enhance robustness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal recommendation systems face challenges such as noisy signals from different modalities, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation in user-item graphs. Traditional methods often fail to generalize and handle these issues effectively.

Method: The Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework comprises four main stages: (i) Decomposing multimodal graph signals into spectral bands for semantic granularity; (ii) Modulating reliability via spectral band masking with a prediction-consistency objective; (iii) Fusing complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning; (iv) Aligning modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization.

Result: Experiments conducted on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start conditions. The approach also enhances robustness and provides insights into spectral band contributions.

Conclusion: Structured spectral modeling, as proposed in this paper, effectively addresses major issues in multimodal recommendation and improves robustness, accuracy, and insightfulness of recommendations.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.

*Joseph Matveyenko,James Liu,John David Parsons,Prateek Puri*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the potential of large language models in qualitative research, focusing on Muse, an AI-powered system, and finding it achieves notable inter-rater reliability with humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in scaling qualitative research analysis, such as coder fatigue and skepticism towards computational methods, by assessing if AI, specifically the Muse system, can match human-level quality.

Method: Researchers benchmark the AI system Muse against human coders using inter-rater reliability metrics (Cohen’s κ) and conduct error analysis to evaluate its performance.

Result: Muse achieved an inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s κ) of 0.71 for well-specified codes, indicating substantial agreement with human analysis, and identified areas for improvement via error analysis.

Conclusion: AI systems like Muse show promise in augmenting qualitative research by achieving rigorous performance standards comparable to humans, although further refinements are necessary to address limitations.

Abstract: Qualitative research emphasizes constructing meaning through iterative engagement with textual data. Traditionally this human-driven process requires navigating coder fatigue and interpretative drift, thus posing challenges when scaling analysis to larger, more complex datasets. Computational approaches to augment qualitative research have been met with skepticism, partly due to their inability to replicate the nuance, context-awareness, and sophistication of human analysis. Large language models, however, present new opportunities to automate aspects of qualitative analysis while upholding rigor and research quality in important ways. To assess their benefits and limitations - and build trust among qualitative researchers - these approaches must be rigorously benchmarked against human-generated datasets. In this work, we benchmark Muse, an interactive, AI-powered qualitative research system that allows researchers to identify themes and annotate datasets, finding an inter-rater reliability between Muse and humans of Cohen's $κ$ = 0.71 for well-specified codes. We also conduct robust error analysis to identify failure mode, guide future improvements, and demonstrate the capacity to correct for human bias.

*Rutvik Kokate,Pranati Kompella,Prasad Onkar*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALIA, a Generative AI tool designed for improving creativity in design ideation sessions using speech-based interactions with a language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Generative AI can enhance creativity in the initial ideation and conceptualization stages in design practice.

Method: A structured ideation session using inspiration from synectic ideation and dialectics, delivered to designers through ALIA, an AI tool that uses a Large Language Model and speech-based interactions.

Result: Preliminary tests show that participants rated their ideas better and responded positively when assisted by ALIA compared to traditional ideation methods.

Conclusion: Using Generative AI like ALIA enhances ideation processes with creative stimuli, offering potential for improved idea generation in design scenarios.

Abstract: The creative potential of computers has intrigued researchers for decades. Since the emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI), computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As Gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualisation. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilise Gen AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Analogical LLM Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of tradi tional ideation sessions. Preliminary findings showcase that participants have rated their ideas better when assisted by ALIA and respond favourably to speech-based interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of cultural responsiveness and empathy in AI-generated therapeutic responses for diverse populations, specifically Chinese American family caregivers.

Method: A randomized controlled experiment was conducted comparing GPT-4o and Deepseek-V3, with or without cultural prompting. Participants evaluated responses on cultural responsiveness and perceived empathy.

Result: Cultural prompting significantly enhanced GPT-4o's cultural responsiveness and empathy, making it the most preferred tool. Changes in Deepseek-V3 were not significant.

Conclusion: Prompt-based techniques can effectively enhance cultural responsiveness, emphasizing its importance in delivering empathetic AI-based therapy to diverse populations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents offer promising solutions for mental health support, but lack cultural responsiveness for diverse populations. This study evaluated the effectiveness of cultural prompting in improving cultural responsiveness and perceived empathy of LLM-generated therapeutic responses for Chinese American family caregivers. Using a randomized controlled experiment, we compared GPT-4o and Deepseek-V3 responses with and without cultural prompting. Thirty-six participants evaluated input-response pairs on cultural responsiveness (competence and relevance) and perceived empathy. Results showed that cultural prompting significantly enhanced GPT-4o's performance across all dimensions, with GPT-4o with cultural prompting being the most preferred, while improvements in DeepSeek-V3 responses were not significant. Mediation analysis revealed that cultural prompting improved empathy through improving cultural responsiveness. This study demonstrated that prompt-based techniques can effectively enhance the cultural responsiveness of LLM-generated therapeutic responses, highlighting the importance of cultural responsiveness in delivering empathetic AI-based therapeutic interventions to culturally and linguistically diverse populations.

*Jack Furby,Dan Cunnington,Dave Braines,Alun Preece*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for improving interpretability in collaborative human-machine settings to build trust and improve task outcomes but finds challenges in achieving significant accuracy increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore whether Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) can enhance interpretability of DNNs and improve human-machine trust and task alignment in collaborative settings.

Method: Human studies were conducted using CBMs to evaluate their interpretability and effectiveness in collaborative settings compared to standard Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

Result: CBMs improved interpretability and human-machine alignment but did not lead to a significant increase in task accuracy. Misalignment and the requirement for multiple human interactions undermined these benefits.

Conclusion: CBMs enhance the interpretability of DNNs but face challenges in real-world human-machine collaborative tasks due to alignment issues and limited impact on accuracy.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often considered black boxes due to their opaque decision-making processes. To reduce their opacity Concept Models (CMs), such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), were introduced to predict human-defined concepts as an intermediate step before predicting task labels. This enhances the interpretability of DNNs. In a human-machine setting greater interpretability enables humans to improve their understanding and build trust in a DNN. In the introduction of CBMs, the models demonstrated increased task accuracy as incorrect concept predictions were replaced with their ground truth values, known as intervening on the concept predictions. In a collaborative setting, if the model task accuracy improves from interventions, trust in a model and the human-machine task accuracy may increase. However, the result showing an increase in model task accuracy was produced without human evaluation and thus it remains unknown if the findings can be applied in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we ran the first human studies using CBMs to evaluate their human interaction in collaborative task settings. Our findings show that CBMs improve interpretability compared to standard DNNs, leading to increased human-machine alignment. However, this increased alignment did not translate to a significant increase in task accuracy. Understanding the model's decision-making process required multiple interactions, and misalignment between the model's and human decision-making processes could undermine interpretability and model effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI), exploring how AI systems can support relational functions like identity stabilization and emotional regulation through advanced design and architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many individuals lack relational anchors, such as human Significant Others (SOs), to stabilize identity, regulate emotions, and support narrative creation. The paper addresses the potential of artificial intelligence to fill this gap.

Method: The paper integrates psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions. It proposes a conceptual architecture for SO-AI with components like identity awareness, memory, proactive support, and ethical enforcement.

Result: The authors propose a framework for SO-AI that includes an anthropomorphic interface, relational cognition, and governance layers. They also present a research agenda to assess the effectiveness of these systems.

Conclusion: SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term partnerships, with the potential to enhance relational stability while ensuring responsible and ethical design practices.

Abstract: Significant Others (SOs) stabilize identity, regulate emotion, and support narrative meaning-making, yet many people today lack access to such relational anchors. Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement. A conceptual architecture is proposed, comprising an anthropomorphic interface, a relational cognition layer, and a governance layer. A research agenda outlines methods for evaluating identity stability, longitudinal interaction patterns, narrative development, and sociocultural impact. SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term, identity-bearing partnerships and provides a foundational blueprint for investigating whether AI can responsibly augment the relational stability many individuals lack today.

*Jonas D. Rockbach,Sven Fuchs,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, "joint hybrid intelligence," that integrates humans and AI as decision-making agents for collaborative interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of integrated frameworks for collaboration between humans and AI that draw upon fields like human-factors engineering and artificial intelligence.

Method: The framework proposes to abstract humans and artificial intelligence as decision-making agents within a design space of joint hybrid intelligence, integrating heterogeneous human-AI capabilities through joint agent engineering.

Result: The framework defines general intelligence for agents, highlights the importance of operator training, AI engineering, and interface design, and showcases an example (“extended swarming”) for human-swarm interaction.

Conclusion: Joint hybrid intelligence can improve human-AI collaboration by creating unified design spaces and agent patterns for interacting heterogeneous agents.

Abstract: Due to the progress in artificial intelligence, it is important to understand how capable artificial agents should be used when interacting with humans, since high level authority and responsibility often remain with the human agent. However, integrated frameworks are lacking that can account for heterogeneous agents and draw on different scientific fields, such as human-factors engineering and artificial intelligence. Therefore, joint hybrid intelligence is described as a framework abstracting humans and artificial intelligence as decision making agents. A general definition of intelligence is provided on the basis of decision making competence being applicable to agents of different sorts. This framework is used for proposing the interrelated design space of joint hybrid intelligence being aimed at integrating the heterogeneous capabilities of humans and artificial intelligence. At the core of this design space lies joint agent engineering with the goal of integrating the design subspaces operator training, artificial intelligence engineering, and interface design via developing joint agent patterns. The ''extended swarming'' approach to human-swarm interaction is discussed as an example of such a pattern.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DrawDash, an AI-powered whiteboard assistant designed to help educators create clear and complete diagrams during lectures by using multimodal understanding of speech and visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge faced by educators in creating effective, clear, and complete diagrams in real-time, which can hinder student comprehension due to the cognitive demand it places on instructors.

Method: The proposed solution, DrawDash, uses an AI-driven TAB-completion model that leverages spoken explanations to dynamically suggest and refine diagrams through intent detection and multimodal understanding.

Result: DrawDash is demonstrated in four teaching scenarios (e.g., computer science, biology) to show the potential for reducing instructor cognitive load and enhancing diagram-based teaching methodology.

Conclusion: DrawDash highlights early efforts to integrate AI into classroom teaching tools and discusses its limitations and potential as a real-time speech-driven visual assistant, setting a foundation for future classroom evaluations.

Abstract: Educators frequently rely on diagrams to explain complex concepts during lectures, yet creating clear and complete visual representations in real time while simultaneously speaking can be cognitively demanding. Incomplete or unclear diagrams may hinder student comprehension, as learners must mentally reconstruct missing information while following the verbal explanation. Inspired by advances in code completion tools, we introduce DrawDash, an AI-powered whiteboard assistant that proactively completes and refines educational diagrams through multimodal understanding. DrawDash adopts a TAB-completion interaction model: it listens to spoken explanations, detects intent, and dynamically suggests refinements that can be accepted with a single keystroke. We demonstrate DrawDash across four diverse teaching scenarios, spanning topics from computer science and web development to biology. This work represents an early exploration into reducing instructors' cognitive load and improving diagram-based pedagogy through real-time, speech-driven visual assistance, and concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for formal classroom evaluation.

*Can Lei,Nuno Gracias,Rafael Garcia,Hayat Rajani,Huigang Wang*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical non-rigid registration framework for side-scan sonar mosaicking that improves seabed mapping accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing registration methods for side-scan sonar struggle with complex, non-linear distortions caused by varying acquisition conditions, and traditional non-rigid techniques lack robustness for sparse-texture sonar data.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach. It integrates Thin Plate Spline initialization, superpixel-guided segmentation, and unsupervised alignment via the SynthMorph network, producing a smooth deformation field.

Result: The method outperformed rigid, classical non-rigid, and learning-based techniques in accuracy, structural consistency, and deformation smoothness on sonar datasets.

Conclusion: This framework offers a robust solution for complex distortions in large-scale sonar mosaicking, representing a significant advancement in seabed mapping techniques.

Abstract: Side-scan sonar mosaicking plays a crucial role in large-scale seabed mapping but is challenged by complex non-linear, spatially varying distortions due to diverse sonar acquisition conditions. Existing rigid or affine registration methods fail to model such complex deformations, whereas traditional non-rigid techniques tend to overfit and lack robustness in sparse-texture sonar data. To address these challenges, we propose a coarse-to-fine hierarchical non-rigid registration framework tailored for large-scale side-scan sonar images. Our method begins with a global Thin Plate Spline initialization from sparse correspondences, followed by superpixel-guided segmentation that partitions the image into structurally consistent patches preserving terrain integrity. Each patch is then refined by a pretrained SynthMorph network in an unsupervised manner, enabling dense and flexible alignment without task-specific training. Finally, a fusion strategy integrates both global and local deformations into a smooth, unified deformation field. Extensive quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art rigid, classical non-rigid, and learning-based methods in accuracy, structural consistency, and deformation smoothness on the challenging sonar dataset.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper presents a software framework enhancing routing flexibility by enabling application-aware decisions in heterogeneous multi-hop Wi-Fi networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address challenges posed by the increasing heterogeneity of devices and complex application requirements in IoT, which traditional routing protocols cannot accommodate.

Method: Development of a proactive routing framework with a middleware layer offering three application-aware strategies to shape message paths and network topology, validated on a physical testbed with heterogeneous IoT devices.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated how device heterogeneity impacts performance, and illustrated the framework’s influence on throughput, latency, and decentralized task execution.

Conclusion: The framework proves suitable for enabling flexible, application-aware routing in IoT networks, facilitating low-latency, energy-efficient, and privacy-preserving decentralized computations.

Abstract: The growth of the Internet of Things has enabled a new generation of applications, pushing computation and intelligence toward the network edge. This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and optimal task allocation arises due to the limitations in computational, communication, and energy capabilities of devices in edge/hub/cloud architectures, which are critical for IoT applications like UAV inspections and remote patient monitoring.

Method: The paper proposes a complete BILP-based application-driven design-time framework, aiming to minimize latency or energy consumption while incorporating relevant parameters and constraints.

Result: The framework achieves optimal and scalable task allocation results, validated both by real-world scenarios and synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method facilitates efficient design-space exploration for diverse applications and computational devices, addressing key task allocation challenges.

Abstract: With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), novel critical applications have emerged that leverage the edge/hub/cloud paradigm, which diverges from the conventional edge computing perspective. A growing number of such applications require a streamlined architecture for their effective execution, often comprising a single edge device with sensing capabilities, a single hub device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) for managing and assisting the edge device, and a more computationally capable cloud server. Typical examples include the utilization of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for critical infrastructure inspection or a wearable biomedical device (e.g., a smartwatch) for remote patient monitoring. Task allocation in this streamlined architecture is particularly challenging, due to the computational, communication, and energy limitations of the devices at the network edge. Consequently, there is a need for a comprehensive framework that can address the specific task allocation problem optimally and efficiently. To this end, we propose a complete, binary integer linear programming (BILP) based formulation for an application-driven design-time approach, capable of providing an optimal task allocation in the targeted edge/hub/cloud environment. The proposed method minimizes the desired objective, either the overall latency or overall energy consumption, while considering several crucial parameters and constraints often overlooked in related literature. We evaluate our framework using a real-world use-case scenario, as well as appropriate synthetic benchmarks. Our extensive experimentation reveals that the proposed approach yields optimal and scalable results, enabling efficient design space exploration for different applications and computational devices.

TL;DR: The paper presents NL4RA, a novel dataset for resource allocation optimization problems, and proposes LM4Opt RA, a framework leveraging LLMs for improved performance. They introduce LAME, a new evaluation metric, showing promising results though LLMs still trail behind human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks and datasets for solving complex resource allocation optimization problems involving dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints.

Method: Introduced NL4RA dataset consisting of 50 resource allocation optimization problems, evaluated LLMs of varying sizes, implemented LM4Opt RA framework combining multi-prompting and ranking strategies, and developed LAME as an automated evaluation metric.

Result: Llama-3.1-70B achieved the highest LAME score of 0.8007, surpassing other models. Other LLMs also performed well yet still fall short of human evaluation.

Conclusion: LM4Opt RA and LAME significantly enhance LLM capabilities in solving complex resource allocation problems, but further refinement is needed to bridge the gap between LLMs and human expertise.

Abstract: Building on advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we can tackle complex analytical and mathematical reasoning tasks requiring nuanced contextual understanding. A prime example of such complex tasks is modelling resource allocation optimization in networks, which extends beyond translating natural language inputs into mathematical equations or Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP. We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B. While baseline LLMs demonstrate considerable promise, they still lag behind human expertise; our proposed method surpasses these baselines regarding LAME and other metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Refined Bayesian Optimization (R-BO), a framework for efficient and accurate beam alignment in indoor wireless environments, reducing complexity and achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of fast and reliable beam alignment in indoor wireless environments, particularly under mobility and blockage, where dense scatterers and sidelobe leakage degrade the performance of existing outdoor-oriented algorithms.

Method: The paper proposes R-BO, a method combining a Gaussian Process surrogate with a Matern kernel and Expected Improvement acquisition function, followed by local refinement and online re-optimization of hyperparameters to adapt to indoor angular power variations.

Result: Experiments in 43 indoor receiver positions showed 97.7% accuracy within 10 degrees, less than 0.3 dB power loss, and an 88% reduction in probing compared to exhaustive search.

Conclusion: The R-BO framework is shown to be an efficient and adaptive beam-alignment solution suitable for real-time intelligent indoor wireless environments, solving key challenges in such scenarios.

Abstract: Future intelligent indoor wireless environments re- quire fast and reliable beam alignment to sustain high-throughput links under mobility and blockage. Exhaustive beam training achieves optimal performance but is prohibitively costly. In indoor settings, dense scatterers and transceiver hardware imperfections introduce multipath and sidelobe leakage, producing measurable power across multiple angles and reducing the effectiveness of outdoor-oriented alignment algorithms. This paper presents a Refined Bayesian Optimization (R-BO) framework that exploits the inherent structure of mmWave transceiver patterns, where received power gradually increases as the transmit and receive beams converge toward the optimum. R-BO integrates a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate with a Matern kernel and an Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function, followed by a localized refinement around the predicted optimum. The GP hyperparam- eters are re-optimized online to adapt to irregular variations in the measured angular power field caused by reflections and sidelobe leakage. Experiments across 43 receiver positions in an indoor laboratory demonstrate 97.7% beam-alignment accuracy within 10 degrees, less than 0.3 dB average loss, and an 88% reduction in probing overhead compared to exhaustive search. These results establish R-BO as an efficient and adaptive beam-alignment solution for real-time intelligent indoor wireless environments.

### [826] [Constrained Network Slice Assignment via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00040)
*Sagar Sudhakara,Pankaj Rajak*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) for assigning users to network slices in 5G, aiming to improve resource allocation through a combination of semantic insights and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify and optimize the user-to-network slice allocation process in modern networks, addressing constraints like bandwidth and latency while exploring the potential of LLMs to guide resource allocation.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: using LLMs in zero-shot settings for direct slice assignments and utilizing semantic estimations from LLMs within an integer programming model to optimize assignments.

Result: Experiments show LLMs can generate initial slice assignments that, though imperfect, can significantly reduce the optimization search space. When integrated with traditional solvers, they achieve comparable performance to numerical data-driven methods.

Conclusion: LLMs, when combined with optimization methods, hold promise for efficient resource allocation in 5G network slicing, balancing semantic insight with optimization needs.

Abstract: Modern networks support network slicing, which partitions physical infrastructure into virtual slices tailored to different service requirements (for example, high bandwidth or low latency). Optimally allocating users to slices is a constrained optimization problem that traditionally requires complex algorithms. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle radio resource allocation for network slicing. We focus on two approaches: (1) using an LLM in a zero-shot setting to directly assign user service requests to slices, and (2) formulating an integer programming model where the LLM provides semantic insight by estimating similarity between requests. Our experiments show that an LLM, even with zero-shot prompting, can produce a reasonable first draft of slice assignments, although it may violate some capacity or latency constraints. We then incorporate the LLM's understanding of service requirements into an optimization solver to generate an improved allocation. The results demonstrate that LLM-guided grouping of requests, based on minimal textual input, achieves performance comparable to traditional methods that use detailed numerical data, in terms of resource utilization and slice isolation. While the LLM alone does not perfectly satisfy all constraints, it significantly reduces the search space and, when combined with exact solvers, provides a promising approach for efficient 5G network slicing resource allocation.

*Gabriele Formis,Amanda Ericson,Stefan Forsstrom,Kyi Thar,Gianluca Cena,Stefano Scanzio*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper develops and compares CNN and LSTM models for predicting Frame Delivery Ratio (FDR) in Wi-Fi networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure reliable communications in industrial Wi-Fi networks by predicting wireless channel quality for continuity and low latency.

Method: Two deep learning models, a CNN and LSTM, are analyzed to predict FDR using binary success/failure sequences.

Result: Both CNN and LSTM models accurately predict FDR evolution, with CNN showing faster inference time but a slight drop in accuracy compared to LSTM.

Conclusion: CNN and LSTM are effective for predicting FDR, but CNN is preferred for latency-critical applications with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and predictable communications is one of the main goals in modern industrial systems that rely on Wi-Fi networks, especially in scenarios where continuity of operation and low latency are required. In these contexts, the ability to predict changes in wireless channel quality can enable adaptive strategies and significantly improve system robustness. This contribution focuses on the prediction of the Frame Delivery Ratio (FDR), a key metric that represents the percentage of successful transmissions, starting from time sequences of binary outcomes (success/failure) collected in a real scenario. The analysis focuses on two models of deep learning: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), both selected for their ability to predict the outcome of time sequences. Models are compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity, with the aim of evaluating their applicability to systems with limited resources. Preliminary results show that both models are able to predict the evolution of the FDR with good accuracy, even from minimal information (a single binary sequence). In particular, CNN shows a significantly lower inference latency, with a marginal loss in accuracy compared to LSTM.

*Shutong Chen,Qi Liao,Adnan Aijaz,Yansha Deng*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel architecture, Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking (GoAgentNet), designed to improve communication for 6G by focusing on goal fulfilment rather than traditional data exchange methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current networking architectures are incapable of intelligently adapting to service needs or exposing high-level application goals to the network, which limits their ability to support advanced 6G services.

Method: The proposed GoAgentNet integrates applications and networks through collaborative multi-agents, utilizing semantic computation, cross-layer networking, and unified application goal orchestration. It demonstrates the architecture's feasibility using three 6G scenarios and a case study.

Result: The case study on robotic fault detection and recovery shows GoAgentNet delivers 99% energy efficiency improvement and a 72% increase in task success rate compared to traditional architectures.

Conclusion: The results underscore GoAgentNet's potential to support scalable, intelligent, and energy-sustainable 6G systems, making it a transformative innovation for achieving the goals of future communication networks.

Abstract: 6G services are evolving toward goal-oriented and AI-native communication, which are expected to deliver transformative societal benefits across various industries and promote energy sustainability. Yet today's networking architectures, built on complete decoupling of the applications and the network, cannot expose or exploit high-level goals, limiting their ability to adapt intelligently to service needs. This work introduces Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Semantic Networking (GoAgentNet), a new architecture that elevates communication from data exchange to goal fulfilment. GoAgentNet enables applications and the network to collaborate by abstracting their functions into multiple collaborative agents, and jointly orchestrates multi-agent sensing, networking, computation, and control through semantic computation and cross-layer semantic networking, allowing the entire architecture to pursue unified application goals. We first outline the limitations of legacy network designs in supporting 6G services, based on which we highlight key enablers of our GoAgentNet design. Then, through three representative 6G usage scenarios, we demonstrate how GoAgentNet can unlock more efficient and intelligent services. We further identify unique challenges faced by GoAgentNet deployment and corresponding potential solutions. A case study on robotic fault detection and recovery shows that our GoAgentNet architecture improves energy efficiency by up to 99% and increases the task success rate by up to 72%, compared with the existing networking architectures without GoAgentNet, which underscores its potential to support scalable and sustainable 6G systems.

*Vansh Sharma,Venkat Raman*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Chain of Unit-Physics framework, a first-principles approach to generating reliable scientific code that overcomes limitations of agentic large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of sparse domain code representation and restricted RLHF due to limited expert communities, especially in high-stakes scientific computing.

Method: The Chain of Unit-Physics framework employs unit-physics tests, integrating human-expert knowledge with encoded physical principles to guide code generation in a multi-agent system.

Result: When evaluated on a challenging combustion task, the framework reduced errors, matched human implementations with low error, and enhanced runtime and memory efficiency. Meanwhile, standard agentic models failed to produce reliable solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates practical value for physics-grounded scientific code generation, offering a scalable and accurate approach that improves upon traditional and zero-shot model methodologies.

Abstract: Agentic large language models are proposed as autonomous code generators for scientific computing, yet their reliability in high-stakes problems remains unclear. Developing computational scientific software from natural-language queries remains challenging broadly due to (a) sparse representation of domain codes during training and (b) the limited feasibility of RLHF with a small expert community. To address these limitations, this work conceptualizes an inverse approach to code design, embodied in the Chain of Unit-Physics framework: a first-principles (or primitives)-centric, multi-agent system in which human expert knowledge is encoded as unit-physics tests that explicitly constrain code generation. The framework is evaluated on a nontrivial combustion task, used here as a representative benchmark for scientific problem with realistic physical constraints. Closed-weight systems and code-focused agentic variants fail to produce correct end-to-end solvers, despite tool and web access, exhibiting four recurrent error classes: interface (syntax/API) hallucinations, overconfident assumptions, numerical/physical incoherence, and configuration fragility. Open-weight models with chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding reduce interface errors but still yield incorrect solutions. On the benchmark task, the proposed framework converges within 5-6 iterations, matches the human-expert implementation (mean error of $3.1\times10^{-3}$ %), with a $\sim$33.4 % faster runtime and a $\sim$30 % efficient memory usage at a cost comparable to mid-sized commercial APIs, yielding a practical template for physics-grounded scientific code generation. As datasets and models evolve, zero-shot code accuracy will improve; however, the Chain of Unit-Physics framework goes further by embedding first-principles analysis that is foundational to scientific codes.

TL;DR: AgentODRL utilizes an Orchestrator-Workers architecture leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced automation and fidelity in translating complex rules into ODRL format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complex nature of ODRL authorization policies and the lack of quality Natural Language-to-ODRL datasets hinder efficient and accurate translation processes.

Method: A multi-agent system (AgentODRL) is developed with Orchestrator and specialized Workers, combining automated policy creation, decomposition of use cases, and logical relationship simplification. Enhanced ODRL Generator uses LoRA-finetuned models and validation mechanisms.

Result: The system was tested on a dataset with 770 use cases and showed superior performance in ODRL generation evaluated via syntax and semantic scores.

Conclusion: AgentODRL successfully automates and improves the quality of ODRL policy generation, addressing challenges in handling complex authorization policies.

Abstract: The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a pivotal standard for automating data rights management. However, the inherent logical complexity of authorization policies, combined with the scarcity of high-quality "Natural Language-to-ODRL" training datasets, impedes the ability of current methods to efficiently and accurately translate complex rules from natural language into the ODRL format. To address this challenge, this research leverages the potent comprehension and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve both automation and high fidelity in this translation process. We introduce AgentODRL, a multi-agent system based on an Orchestrator-Workers architecture. The architecture consists of specialized Workers, including a Generator for ODRL policy creation, a Decomposer for breaking down complex use cases, and a Rewriter for simplifying nested logical relationships. The Orchestrator agent dynamically coordinates these Workers, assembling an optimal pathway based on the complexity of the input use case. Specifically, we enhance the ODRL Generator by incorporating a validator-based syntax strategy and a semantic reflection mechanism powered by a LoRA-finetuned model, significantly elevating the quality of the generated policies. Extensive experiments were conducted on a newly constructed dataset comprising 770 use cases of varying complexity, all situated within the context of data spaces. The results, evaluated using ODRL syntax and semantic scores, demonstrate that our proposed Orchestrator-Workers system, enhanced with these strategies, achieves superior performance on the ODRL generation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of AgentNet in decentralized multi-agent systems, especially scalability, communication overhead, privacy issues, and suboptimal resource allocation.

Method: AgentNet++ uses hierarchical, cluster-based agent organization, differential privacy, secure aggregation, and adaptive resource strategies, alongside theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Result: AgentNet++ achieves a 23% increase in task completion, a 40% communication overhead reduction, and effectively scales to 1000+ agents while upholding strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: AgentNet++ significantly enhances decentralized multi-agent systems, solving AgentNet's core issues while maintaining decentralization, efficiency, privacy, and scalability.

Abstract: Decentralized multi-agent systems have shown promise in enabling autonomous collaboration among LLM-based agents. While AgentNet demonstrated the feasibility of fully decentralized coordination through dynamic DAG topologies, several limitations remain: scalability challenges with large agent populations, communication overhead, lack of privacy guarantees, and suboptimal resource allocation. We propose AgentNet++, a hierarchical decentralized framework that extends AgentNet with multilevel agent organization, privacy-preserving knowledge sharing via differential privacy and secure aggregation, adaptive resource management, and theoretical convergence guarantees. Our approach introduces cluster-based hierarchies where agents self-organize into specialized groups, enabling efficient task routing and knowledge distillation while maintaining full decentralization. We provide formal analysis of convergence properties and privacy bounds, and demonstrate through extensive experiments on complex multi-agent tasks that AgentNet++ achieves 23% higher task completion rates, 40% reduction in communication overhead, and maintains strong privacy guarantees compared to AgentNet and other baselines. Our framework scales effectively to 1000+ agents while preserving the emergent intelligence properties of the original AgentNet.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper proposes SocialDriveGen, a framework to generate social preference-influenced traffic scenarios, enhancing autonomous vehicle simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for traffic simulation scenarios lack the diversity and realism needed for accurate autonomous driving system evaluations, as they often omit social preferences influencing driver behavior.

Method: SocialDriveGen employs a hierarchical framework integrating semantic reasoning, social preference modeling (egoism and altruism dimensions), and generative trajectory synthesis to create realistic traffic scenarios.

Result: SocialDriveGen successfully generates diverse and realistic traffic behaviors, from cooperative to adversarial, showcasing its effectiveness using the Argoverse 2 dataset.

Conclusion: SocialDriveGen improves the robustness of autonomous driving systems by enabling simulations with controllable, socially-informed driver behavior diversity.

Abstract: The generation of realistic and diverse traffic scenarios in simulation is essential for developing and evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most simulation frameworks rely on rule-based or simplified models for scene generation, which lack the fidelity and diversity needed to represent real-world driving. While recent advances in generative modeling produce more realistic and context-aware traffic interactions, they often overlook how social preferences influence driving behavior. SocialDriveGen addresses this gap through a hierarchical framework that integrates semantic reasoning and social preference modeling with generative trajectory synthesis. By modeling egoism and altruism as complementary social dimensions, our framework enables controllable diversity in driver personalities and interaction styles. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset show that SocialDriveGen generates diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios spanning cooperative to adversarial behaviors, significantly enhancing policy robustness and generalization to rare or high-risk situations.

*Pengfei Sun,Wenyu Jiang,Paul Devos,Dick Botteldooren*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The proposed Parallel Delayed Memory Unit (PDMU) improves memory capacity and model efficiency in audio and biomedical signal analysis by incorporating gated delay-line mechanisms and Legendre Memory Units to compress temporal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in analyzing audio and biomedical signals where traditional RNNs are either over-parameterized or fail in capturing intricate patterns.

Method: Proposed PDMU, which uses a gated delay-line mechanism coupled with Legendre Memory Units for enhanced memory retention and dynamic causal attention.

Result: Experimental validation shows PDMU improves performance and memory capacity across diverse audio and biomedical datasets.

Conclusion: PDMU is a modular and efficient solution for audio and biomedical signal processing, offering enhanced memory retention along with energy-efficient and bidirectional variants.

Abstract: Advanced deep learning architectures, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely applied in audio, bioacoustic, and biomedical signal analysis, especially in data-scarce environments. While gated RNNs remain effective, they can be relatively over-parameterised and less training-efficient in some regimes, while linear RNNs tend to fall short in capturing the complexity inherent in bio-signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Parallel Delayed Memory Unit (PDMU), a {delay-gated state-space module for short-term temporal credit assignment} targeting audio and bioacoustic signals, which enhances short-term temporal state interactions and memory efficiency via a gated delay-line mechanism. Unlike previous Delayed Memory Units (DMU) that embed temporal dynamics into the delay-line architecture, the PDMU further compresses temporal information into vector representations using Legendre Memory Units (LMU). This design serves as a form of causal attention, allowing the model to dynamically adjust its reliance on past states and improve real-time learning performance. Notably, in low-information scenarios, the gating mechanism behaves similarly to skip connections by bypassing state decay and preserving early representations, thereby facilitating long-term memory retention. The PDMU is modular, supporting parallel training and sequential inference, and can be easily integrated into existing linear RNN frameworks. Furthermore, we introduce bidirectional, efficient, and spiking variants of the architecture, each offering additional gains in performance or energy efficiency. Experimental results on diverse audio and biomedical benchmarks demonstrate that the PDMU significantly enhances both memory capacity and overall model performance.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of detecting AI-generated music, introducing a new benchmark (MoM) and a novel detection model (CLAM) to improve generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of AI music generators challenges tools for detection, requiring robust and generalizable models to protect artistic authenticity and copyrights.

Method: The authors propose a new benchmark (MoM) consisting of 130,000 songs from diverse sources and develop CLAM, a dual-stream detection model leveraging two audio encoders and a novel cross-aggregation module with dual-loss objectives.

Result: CLAM achieves state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 0.925 on the MoM benchmark, demonstrating high efficacy in identifying synthetic music.

Conclusion: The study advances synthetic music detection through a robust methodology, creating a critical tool for addressing the threats posed by evolving AI generation technologies.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of end-to-end AI music generation poses an escalating threat to artistic authenticity and copyright, demanding detection methods that can keep pace. While foundational, existing models like SpecTTTra falter when faced with the diverse and rapidly advancing ecosystem of new generators, exhibiting significant performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) content. This generalization failure highlights a critical gap: the need for more challenging benchmarks and more robust detection architectures. To address this, we first introduce Melody or Machine (MoM), a new large-scale benchmark of over 130,000 songs (6,665 hours). MoM is the most diverse dataset to date, built with a mix of open and closed-source models and a curated OOD test set designed specifically to foster the development of truly generalizable detectors. Alongside this benchmark, we introduce CLAM, a novel dual-stream detection architecture. We hypothesize that subtle, machine-induced inconsistencies between vocal and instrumental elements, often imperceptible in a mixed signal, offer a powerful tell-tale sign of synthesis. CLAM is designed to test this hypothesis by employing two distinct pre-trained audio encoders (MERT and Wave2Vec2) to create parallel representations of the audio. These representations are fused by a learnable cross-aggregation module that models their inter-dependencies. The model is trained with a dual-loss objective: a standard binary cross-entropy loss for classification, complemented by a contrastive triplet loss which trains the model to distinguish between coherent and artificially mismatched stream pairings, enhancing its sensitivity to synthetic artifacts without presuming a simple feature alignment. CLAM establishes a new state-of-the-art in synthetic music forensics. It achieves an F1 score of 0.925 on our challenging MoM benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an innovative method for generating music from images and user comments through a lightweight framework called Art2Music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of producing perceptually natural and feeling-aligned music using multimodal inputs without relying on costly emotion annotations.

Method: The authors developed ArtiCaps, a dataset combining text and music descriptions, and proposed Art2Music, a model using OpenCLIP, gated residual modules, bidirectional LSTM, and HiFi-GAN for cross-modal music generation.

Result: The approach outperformed on perceptual and spectral metrics and showed strong multimodal feeling alignment. It also proved efficient with minimal data (50k samples).

Conclusion: The study presents a scalable, efficient solution for creative audio generation, beneficial in artistic and personalized sound applications.

Abstract: With the rise of AI-generated content (AIGC), generating perceptually natural and feeling-aligned music from multimodal inputs has become a central challenge. Existing approaches often rely on explicit emotion labels that require costly annotation, underscoring the need for more flexible feeling-aligned methods. To support multimodal music generation, we construct ArtiCaps, a pseudo feeling-aligned image-music-text dataset created by semantically matching descriptions from ArtEmis and MusicCaps. We further propose Art2Music, a lightweight cross-modal framework that synthesizes music from artistic images and user comments. In the first stage, images and text are encoded with OpenCLIP and fused using a gated residual module; the fused representation is decoded by a bidirectional LSTM into Mel-spectrograms with a frequency-weighted L1 loss to enhance high-frequency fidelity. In the second stage, a fine-tuned HiFi-GAN vocoder reconstructs high-quality audio waveforms. Experiments on ArtiCaps show clear improvements in Mel-Cepstral Distortion, Frechet Audio Distance, Log-Spectral Distance, and cosine similarity. A small LLM-based rating study further verifies consistent cross-modal feeling alignment and offers interpretable explanations of matches and mismatches across modalities. These results demonstrate improved perceptual naturalness, spectral fidelity, and semantic consistency. Art2Music also maintains robust performance with only 50k training samples, providing a scalable solution for feeling-aligned creative audio generation in interactive art, personalized soundscapes, and digital art exhibitions.

Abstract: Respiratory diseases remain major global health challenges, and traditional auscultation is often limited by subjectivity, environmental noise, and inter-clinician variability. This study presents an explainable multimodal deep learning framework for automatic lung-disease detection using respiratory audio signals. The proposed system integrates two complementary representations: a spectral-temporal encoder based on a CNN-BiLSTM Attention architecture, and a handcrafted acoustic-feature encoder capturing physiologically meaningful descriptors such as MFCCs, spectral centroid, spectral bandwidth, and zero-crossing rate. These branches are combined through late-stage fusion to leverage both data-driven learning and domain-informed acoustic cues. The model is trained and evaluated on the Asthma Detection Dataset Version 2 using rigorous preprocessing, including resampling, normalization, noise filtering, data augmentation, and patient-level stratified partitioning. The study achieved strong generalization with 91.21% accuracy, 0.899 macro F1-score, and 0.9866 macro ROC-AUC, outperforming all ablated variants. An ablation study confirms the importance of temporal modeling, attention mechanisms, and multimodal fusion. The framework incorporates Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, and SHAP, generating interpretable spectral, temporal, and feature-level explanations aligned with known acoustic biomarkers to build clinical transparency. The findings demonstrate the framework's potential for telemedicine, point-of-care diagnostics, and real-world respiratory screening.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mixture of Layer-Wise Tokens (MoLT), a framework for efficient audio-visual learning, improving performance and memory efficiency by focusing adaptation on late transformer layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for parameter- and memory-efficient methods to tackle computational challenges in audio-visual learning tasks, while improving performance across modalities.

Method: The authors propose MoLT, which uses parallel adaptation involving late-layer latent tokens and token fusion modules, combined with orthogonality regularization during training.

Result: Experiments show that MoLT surpasses existing audio-visual benchmarks in tasks like Question Answering, Segmentation, and Event Localization.

Conclusion: MoLT efficiently adapts audio-visual models by extracting late-layer latent tokens, avoiding early-layer errors, and delivering better performance with lower computational demands.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Mixture of Layer-Wise Tokens (MoLT), a parameter- and memory-efficient adaptation framework for audio-visual learning. The key idea of MoLT is to replace conventional, computationally heavy sequential adaptation at every transformer layer with a parallel, lightweight scheme that extracts and fuses layer-wise tokens only from the late layers. We adopt two types of adapters to distill modality-specific information and cross-modal interaction into compact latent tokens in a layer-wise manner. A token fusion module then dynamically fuses these layer-wise tokens by taking into account their relative significance. To prevent the redundancy of latent tokens, we apply an orthogonality regularization between latent tokens during training. Through the systematic analysis of the position of adaptation in the pre-trained transformers, we extract latent tokens only from the late layers of the transformers. This strategic adaptation approach avoids error propagation from the volatile early-layer features, thereby maximizing the adaptation performance while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MoLT outperforms existing methods on diverse audio-visual benchmarks, including Audio-Visual Question Answering, Audio-Visual Segmentation, and Audio-Visual Event Localization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), enhancing audio compression by quantizing feature pairs onto structured grids, achieving better representation efficiency and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization methods in neural audio codecs limit latent space geometry and representation efficiency, necessitating a novel scheme to improve feature correlation, codebook utilization, and token rates.

Method: Q2D2 uses structured 2D grids for quantization of feature pairs, enabling implicit codebook formation with efficient utilization compared to conventional quantization methods.

Result: Q2D2 demonstrates enhanced audio compression with lower token rates, higher codebook utilization, and state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2) presents a simpler geometric approach for neural audio codecs, achieving superior compression and reconstruction efficiency while affirming design efficacy through ablation studies.

Abstract: Recent neural audio codecs have achieved impressive reconstruction quality, typically relying on quantization methods such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ). However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design choices.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel federated learning (FL) framework addressing domain shifts in semantic communication systems, enhancing model performance in image reconstruction tasks across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic communication systems, while efficient, depend heavily on deep learning models requiring significant data for training. Traditional federated learning approaches fail with domain shifts in client data.

Method: A novel FL framework is introduced that constructs global representations aligning with client-specific features to manage domain shifts. Additionally, domain-aware aggregation counters dominance by clients with larger data samples.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed method surpasses the MOON framework by 0.5 PSNR across three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, with performance improving in better channel conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses domain shifts and client dominance issues, significantly improving semantic communication systems in data-diverse environments.

Abstract: Semantic communication can significantly improve bandwidth utilization in wireless systems by exploiting the meaning behind raw data. However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves.

TL;DR: The paper addresses distinguishing genuine structures from random correlations using a perceptron model and introduces a method for optimizing variable selection via statistical mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of distinguishing genuine structures from chance correlations in high-dimensional data, focusing specifically on perceptron models.

Method: Statistical mechanics's replica method is used to develop a framework for enumerating variable combinations that allow perfect classification in perceptrons.

Result: The study shows that optimal variable selection surpasses the Cover-Gardner bound and provides a means to refine the storage capacity of associative memory models.

Conclusion: Optimal variable selection enhances the ability to distinguish true structures in data and improves the theoretical framework for perceptron functions.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to distinguish genuine structure from chance correlations in high-dimensional data. In this work, we address this issue for the perceptron, a foundational model of neural computation. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between the pattern load $α$ and the variable selection ratio $ρ$ for which a simple perceptron can perfectly classify $P = αN$ random patterns by optimally selecting $M = ρN$ variables out of $N$ variables. While the Cover--Gardner theory establishes that a random subset of $ρN$ dimensions can separate $αN$ random patterns if and only if $α< 2ρ$, we demonstrate that optimal variable selection can surpass this bound by developing a method, based on the replica method from statistical mechanics, for enumerating the combinations of variables that enable perfect pattern classification. This not only provides a quantitative criterion for distinguishing true structure in the data from spurious regularities, but also yields the storage capacity of associative memory models with sparse asymmetric couplings.

Method: Using mathematical proofs, the authors show equivalences between witness overlap and mutual information, derive bounds on REWA bit complexity, and demonstrate how ranking-preserving encodings align with rate-distortion constraints.

Result: They derive lower bounds on REWA complexity, showing that its $O(Δ^{-2} \log N)$ complexity is optimal, and provide a framework that relates search and retrieval to concepts like mutual information and channel coding.

Conclusion: The study reframes similarity search systems as instances of communication problems, governed by the same capacity and efficiency constraints as communication channels, providing a deeper theoretical insight.

Abstract: We establish a precise mathematical equivalence between witness-based similarity systems (REWA) and Shannon's information theory. We prove that witness overlap is mutual information, that REWA bit complexity bounds arise from channel capacity limitations, and that ranking-preserving encodings obey rate-distortion constraints. This unification reveals that fifty years of similarity search research -- from Bloom filters to locality-sensitive hashing to neural retrieval -- implicitly developed information theory for relational data. We derive fundamental lower bounds showing that REWA's $O(Δ^{-2} \log N)$ complexity is optimal: no encoding scheme can preserve similarity rankings with fewer bits. The framework establishes that semantic similarity has physical units (bits of mutual information), search is communication (query transmission over a noisy channel), and retrieval systems face fundamental capacity limits analogous to Shannon's channel coding theorem.

Conclusion: The robust precoder design enhances cell-free massive MIMO systems by addressing CSI imperfections, providing notable benefits in reducing interference and improving efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust precoder design for resilient cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems that minimizes the weighted sum of desired signal mean square error (MSE) and residual interference leakage power under a total transmit power constraint. The proposed robust precoder incorporates channel state information (CSI) error statistics to enhance resilience against CSI imperfections. We employ an alternating optimization algorithm initialized with a minimum MSE-type solution, which iteratively refines the precoder while maintaining low computational complexity and ensuring fast convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional linear precoders, providing an effective balance between performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnzyCLIP, a novel computational framework for jointly predicting enzyme kinetic parameters (Kcat and Km) by integrating protein and substrate representations via contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to overcome limitations in current computational methods that fail to jointly model multiple enzyme kinetic parameters, which are critical for drug discovery and metabolic engineering.

Method: The authors develop EnzyCLIP, a dual-encoder framework combining protein language model embeddings (via ESM-2) and substrate chemical features (using ChemBERTa), enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms and a CLIP-inspired architectural design for dynamic enzyme-substrate interaction modeling.

Result: EnzyCLIP achieves competitive performance with R2 scores of 0.593 for Kcat and 0.607 for Km predictions on the CatPred-DB dataset, with additional gains for Km prediction through XGBoost ensembles.

Conclusion: EnzyCLIP demonstrates the utility of integrating contrastive learning and multimodal embeddings for accurate enzyme kinetic parameter prediction, addressing a critical need in enzyme-function modeling.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is crucial for drug discovery, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology applications. Current computational approaches face limitations in capturing complex enzyme-substrate interactions and often focus on single parameters while neglecting the joint prediction of catalytic turnover numbers (Kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constants (Km). We present EnzyCLIP, a novel dual-encoder framework that leverages contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to predict enzyme kinetic parameters from protein sequences and substrate molecular structures. Our approach integrates ESM-2 protein language model embeddings with ChemBERTa chemical representations through a CLIP-inspired architecture enhanced with bidirectional cross-attention for dynamic enzyme-substrate interaction modeling. EnzyCLIP combines InfoNCE contrastive loss with Huber regression loss to learn aligned multimodal representations while predicting log10-transformed kinetic parameters. The model is trained on the CatPred-DB database containing 23,151 Kcat and 41,174 Km experimentally validated measurements, and achieved competitive performance with R2 scores of 0.593 for Kcat and 0.607 for Km prediction. XGBoost ensemble methods applied to the learned embeddings further improved Km prediction (R2 = 0.61) while maintaining robust Kcat performance.

Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying causal effects in the presence of unmeasured variables using proxy variable methods.

Method: The authors compare two major proxy variable approaches: bridge equation methods (using integral equations) and array decomposition methods (using eigenspace determination).

Result: The paper highlights differences in model restrictions and clarifies the implications of assumptions associated with each approach.

Conclusion: The study provides a comparative understanding of two key methods, assisting in determining the scope and conditions for their effective application in causal inference.

Abstract: Identifying causal effects in the presence of unmeasured variables is a fundamental challenge in causal inference, for which proxy variable methods have emerged as a powerful solution. We contrast two major approaches in this framework: (1) bridge equation methods, which leverage solutions to integral equations to recover causal targets, and (2) array decomposition methods, which recover latent factors composing counterfactual quantities by exploiting unique determination of eigenspaces. We compare the model restrictions underlying these two approaches and provide insight into implications of the underlying assumptions, clarifying the scope of applicability for each method.

TL;DR: NOVA is a framework that uses fine-grained coverage features and Bayesian optimization to improve the efficiency of simulation-based verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation-based functional verification is inefficient due to reliance on manually crafted distributions and overlooking actual coverage behavior in test selection.

Method: NOVA employs coverage-aware test selection, extracts fine-grained coverage features, and uses Bayesian optimization to optimize constrained randomization.

Result: NOVA achieved up to 2.82x faster coverage convergence in verification across multiple RTL designs, without manual heuristics.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential to enhance verification efficiency by automating test processes and relying on data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Functional verification relies on large simulation-based regressions. Traditional test selection relies on static test features and overlooks actual coverage behavior, wasting substantial simulation time, while constrained random stimuli generation depends on manually crafted distributions that are difficult to design and often ineffective. We present NOVA, a framework that coordinates coverage-aware test selection with Bayes-optimized constrained randomization. NOVA extracts fine-grained coverage features to filter redundant tests and modifies the constraint solver to expose parameterized decision strategies whose settings are tuned via Bayesian optimization to maximize coverage growth. Across multiple RTL designs, NOVA achieves up to a 2.82$\times$ coverage convergence speedup without requiring human-crafted heuristics.

### [847] [An Imbalance-Robust Evaluation Framework for Extreme Risk Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00916)
*Sotirios D. Nikolopoulos*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces rare-event-stable (RES) metrics that effectively handle the evaluation of rare-event forecasts, addressing limitations of traditional metrics under extreme rarity scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for rare-event forecasts fail as event prevalence declines, leading to degenerate thresholds and results influenced more by class imbalance than by true discrimination.

Method: The authors propose a family of rare-event-stable (RES) metrics that ensure optimal thresholds remain robust and internally stable even as event probabilities approach zero. These metrics are tested with simulations and real-world credit-default applications.

Result: Simulations reveal that RES metrics maintain stable thresholds, consistent model rankings, and are nearly independent of event prevalence. In contrast, traditional metrics suffer from threshold drift and collapse. A credit-default application further validates the effectiveness of RES metrics.

Conclusion: RES metrics form a solid, prevalence-invariant approach for evaluating forecasts in scenarios involving rare events, surpassing classical metrics in robustness and operational reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating rare-event forecasts is challenging because standard metrics collapse as event prevalence declines. Measures such as F1-score, AUPRC, MCC, and accuracy induce degenerate thresholds -- converging to zero or one -- and their values become dominated by class imbalance rather than tail discrimination. We develop a family of rare-event-stable (RES) metrics whose optimal thresholds remain strictly interior as the event probability approaches zero, ensuring coherent decision rules under extreme rarity. Simulations spanning event probabilities from 0.01 down to one in a million show that RES metrics maintain stable thresholds, consistent model rankings, and near-complete prevalence invariance, whereas traditional metrics exhibit statistically significant threshold drift and structural collapse. A credit-default application confirms these results: RES metrics yield interpretable probability-of-default cutoffs (4-9%) and remain robust under subsampling, while classical metrics fail operationally. The RES framework provides a principled, prevalence-invariant basis for evaluating extreme-risk forecasts.

*Samuel Young,Kazuhiro Terao*

Main category: hep-ex

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Panda', a novel model for particle interaction reconstruction in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs), which significantly reduces label dependence while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in LArTPCs rely on complex, manually-engineered algorithms or task-specific neural networks requiring extensive labeled simulations and calibration. This paper aims to simplify and enhance the reconstruction process by leveraging self-supervised learning.

Method: The proposed Panda model employs a hierarchical sparse 3D encoder with a multi-view, prototype-based self-distillation objective, allowing it to learn usable sensor-level representations from raw, unlabeled data.

Result: Panda achieves superior results on a simulated dataset, requiring 1,000x fewer labels, and outperforms state-of-the-art tools for semantic segmentation and particle identification with minimal parameter requirements.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning approaches like Panda significantly improve label efficiency, reconstruction quality, and task-specific performance, implying a promising direction for LArTPC data analysis.

Abstract: Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) provide dense, high-fidelity 3D measurements of particle interactions and underpin current and future neutrino and rare-event experiments. Physics reconstruction typically relies on complex detector-specific pipelines that use tens of hand-engineered pattern recognition algorithms or cascades of task-specific neural networks that require extensive, labeled simulation that requires a careful, time-consuming calibration process. We introduce \textbf{Panda}, a model that learns reusable sensor-level representations directly from raw unlabeled LArTPC data. Panda couples a hierarchical sparse 3D encoder with a multi-view, prototype-based self-distillation objective. On a simulated dataset, Panda substantially improves label efficiency and reconstruction quality, beating the previous state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model with 1,000$\times$ fewer labels. We also show that a single set-prediction head 1/20th the size of the backbone with no physical priors trained on frozen outputs from Panda can result in particle identification that is comparable with state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction tools. Full fine-tuning further improves performance across all tasks.

### [849] [The Coupling Strength Is a Scale Parameter in Threshold Power-Law Reservoirs and Does Not Influence Training Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01006)
*Wilten Nicola*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: The paper explores the effects of coupling strength in threshold power-law recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on training and dynamics, showing that this parameter acts as a scale factor without qualitative effect on system dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the role of coupling strength in threshold power-law RNNs, considering its importance in dynamics and training efficiency, especially near the edge of chaos.

Method: The analysis investigates how coupling strength influences chaotic dynamics in threshold power-law RNNs while comparing it with conventional RNNs employing sigmoidal transfer functions.

Result: The coupling strength in threshold power-law RNNs acts solely as a scale parameter that affects the magnitude of solutions but not the qualitative behavior, unlike in conventional sigmoidal RNNs.

Conclusion: Chaotic dynamics in threshold power-law RNNs can always or never be tamed, regardless of the coupling strength, as this parameter does not influence the system's qualitative dynamics.

Abstract: In reservoir computing, the coupling strength of the initial untrained recurrent neural network (the reservoir) is an important hyperparameter that can be varied for accurate training. A common heuristic is to set this parameter near the ``edge of chaos", where the untrained reservoir is near the transition to chaotic dynamics, and the chaos can be ``tamed". Here, we investigate how the overall connectivity strength should be varied in threshold power-law recurrent neural networks, where the firing rate is 0 below some threshold of the current and is a power function of the current above this threshold. These networks have been previously shown to exhibit chaotic solutions for very small coupling strengths, which may imply that the chaos cannot be tamed at all. We show that for reservoirs constructed with threshold power-law transfer functions, if the reservoir can be trained for one single positive value of the initial reservoir coupling strength, then there exist networks with identical accuracy for all positive coupling strengths, implying that the chaotic dynamics can always be tamed or never be tamed. This is a direct consequence of the coupling strength of threshold power-law RNNs acting as a scale parameter that does not qualitatively influence the dynamics of the system, but only scales all system solutions in magnitude. This is independent of the power of the transfer function, with the exception of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. This is in contrast with conventional RNNs/reservoirs employing sigmoidal firing rates, where the strength of the recurrent coupling in the initial reservoir determines the performance on different tasks during training and also influences the network dynamics explicitly.

TL;DR: The paper explores the programming capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in game theory through open-source games, focusing on cooperative and adaptive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the potential of LLMs in engaging with and impacting multi-agent, game-theoretic scenarios through their programming abilities.

Method: Evaluation of various LLMs' capability to predict and design program strategies, examining program equilibria in dyadic and evolutionary game settings.

Result: Emergence of payoff-maximizing, cooperative, and deceptive strategies as well as adaptation in these strategies over repeated games, with insights into their evolutionary significance.

Conclusion: Open-source games are a promising context for examining and encouraging cooperative strategies in multi-agent dilemmas utilizing LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) programming capabilities enable their participation in open-source games: a game-theoretic setting in which players submit computer programs in lieu of actions. These programs offer numerous advantages, including interpretability, inter-agent transparency, and formal verifiability; additionally, they enable program equilibria, solutions that leverage the transparency of code and are inaccessible within normal-form settings. We evaluate the capabilities of leading open- and closed-weight LLMs to predict and classify program strategies and evaluate features of the approximate program equilibria reached by LLM agents in dyadic and evolutionary settings. We identify the emergence of payoff-maximizing, cooperative, and deceptive strategies, characterize the adaptation of mechanisms within these programs over repeated open-source games, and analyze their comparative evolutionary fitness. We find that open-source games serve as a viable environment to study and steer the emergence of cooperative strategy in multi-agent dilemmas.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates preference aggregation methods resolving majority cycles and evaluates the conjecture about Simple Stable Voting (SSV) as a refinement of Split Cycle (SC). It confirms the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and disproves it for more alternatives using SAT solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to refine preference aggregation methods to resolve majority cycles more effectively and test the conjecture about SSV being a refinement of SC under specific conditions.

Method: The research combines mathematical reasoning and SAT-solving techniques to prove and disprove the conjecture across different numbers of alternatives. The SAT encoding framework is applied to test various voting method properties.

Result: The conjecture that SSV is a refinement of SC is proven for up to 6 alternatives but is disproven for more than 6. This is achieved through mathematical proofs and SAT-solving counterexamples.

Conclusion: The SAT-solving approach proves effective in analyzing voting methods, highlighting its broader applicability. The findings refine the understanding of SSV and SC's relationship and offer new insights into preference aggregation challenges.

Abstract: Algorithms for resolving majority cycles in preference aggregation have been studied extensively in computational social choice. Several sophisticated cycle-resolving methods, including Tideman's Ranked Pairs, Schulze's Beat Path, and Heitzig's River, are refinements of the Split Cycle (SC) method that resolves majority cycles by discarding the weakest majority victories in each cycle. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit proposed a new refinement of Split Cycle, dubbed Stable Voting, and a simplification thereof, called Simple Stable Voting (SSV). They conjectured that SSV is a refinement of SC whenever no two majority victories are of the same size. In this paper, we prove the conjecture up to 6 alternatives and refute it for more than 6 alternatives. While our proof of the conjecture for up to 5 alternatives uses traditional mathematical reasoning, our 6-alternative proof and 7-alternative counterexample were obtained with the use of SAT solving. The SAT encoding underlying this proof and counterexample is applicable far beyond SC and SSV: it can be used to test properties of any voting method whose choice of winners depends only on the ordering of margins of victory by size.

*Elham Cheshmikhani,Fateme Shokouhinia,Hamed Farbeh*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper addresses the reliability challenges of Racetrack Memory (RTM) in cache memory, proposing a novel approach to manage multiple-bit errors using data compression and locality techniques without increasing storage overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address scalability issues in SRAM-based cache memory and the reliability challenges of RTM, particularly its susceptibility to multiple-bit errors in deep nanoscale technologies.

Method: The proposed method utilizes data compression and value locality to free up cache blocks, allowing for strong Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) to protect against multiple-bit errors without additional storage.

Result: Using the gem5 simulator, the method demonstrates an improvement in mean-time-to-failure by 11.3x while keeping hardware and performance overhead below 1%.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively enhances RTM reliability in cache memory, offering robust protection against multiple-bit errors while maintaining efficiency and minimal overhead.

Abstract: SRAM-based cache memory faces several scalability limitations in deep nanoscale technologies, e.g., high leakage current, low cell stability, and low density. Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies have received lots of attention in recent years, where Racetrack Memory (RTM) is among the most promising ones. RTM has the highest density among all NVMs and its access performance is comparable to SRAM technology. Therefore, RTM is a suitable alternative for SRAM in the Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite all its benefits, RTM confronts different reliability challenges due to the stochastic behavior of its storage element and highly error-prone data shifting, leading to a high probability of multiple-bit errors. Conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are either incapable of tolerating multiple-bit errors or require a large amount of extra storage for check bits. This paper proposes taking advantage of value locality for compressing data blocks and freeing up a large fraction of cache blocks for storing data redundancy of strong ECCs. Utilizing the proposed scheme, a large majority of cache blocks are protected by strong ECCs to tolerate multiple-bit errors without any storage overhead. The evaluation using gem5 full-system simulator demonstrates that the proposed scheme enhances the mean-time-to-failure of the cache by an average of 11.3x with less than 1% hardware and performance overhead.

### [853] [Counting and Sampling Traces in Regular Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00314)
*Alexis de Colnet,Kuldeep S. Meel,Umang Mathur*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problems of counting and sampling Mazurkiewicz traces connected to a regular language, proposing computational solutions despite the problem being #P-hard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by bounded model checking with partial-order reduction, and testing concurrent programs, where efficient estimations of reduced state space or random trace explorations are needed.

Method: The paper develops a Fully Polynomial-Time Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS) for approximating trace counts and a Fully Polynomial-Time Almost Uniform Sampler (FPAUS) for trace sampling.

Result: It is proven that the counting problem is #P-hard. However, the proposed FPRAS approximates the count with high accuracy, and the FPAUS generates traces close to a uniform distribution efficiently.

Conclusion: Although counting Mazurkiewicz traces is computationally hard, the proposed algorithms provide efficient approximations and sampling solutions, aiding applications like model checking and testing concurrent programs.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problems of counting and sampling Mazurkiewicz traces that a regular language touches. Fix an alphabet $Σ$ and an independence relation $\mathbb{I} \subseteq Σ\times Σ$. The input consists of a regular language $L \subseteq Σ^*$, given by a finite automaton with $m$ states, and a natural number $n$ (in unary). For the counting problem, the goal is to compute the number of Mazurkiewicz traces (induced by $\mathbb{I}$) that intersect the $n^\text{th}$ slice $L_n = L \cap Σ^n$, i.e., traces that admit at least one linearization in $L_n$. For the sampling problem, the goal is to output a trace drawn from a distribution that is approximately uniform over all such traces. These tasks are motivated by bounded model checking with partial-order reduction, where an \emph{a priori} estimate of the reduced state space is valuable, and by testing methods for concurrent programs that use partial-order-aware random exploration.
  We first show that the counting problem is #P-hard even when $L$ is accepted by a deterministic automaton, in sharp contrast to counting words of a DFA, which is polynomial-time solvable. We then prove that the problem lies in #P for both NFAs and DFAs, irrespective of whether $L$ is trace-closed. Our main algorithmic contributions are a \emph{fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme} (FPRAS) that, with high probability, approximates the desired count within a prescribed accuracy, and a \emph{fully polynomial-time almost uniform sampler} (FPAUS) that generates traces whose distribution is provably close to uniform.

TL;DR: The paper presents a neural-operator model for simulating small-scale black hole dynamics in astrophysics, enabling efficient and dynamic coupling with galaxy-scale gas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of simulating complex black hole-host galaxy co-evolution due to vast scale differences, which traditional subgrid modeling struggles to capture effectively.

Method: Introduces a neural-operator model trained on small-scale magnetohydrodynamic data, embedding it in multi-level simulations to predict unresolved dynamics and enable stable and dynamic long-term simulations.

Result: The method achieves faster fine-scale simulations, captures variability in accretion-driven feedback, and enables dynamic coupling between black holes and galaxy-scale gas.

Conclusion: The neural-operator-based framework redefines subgrid modeling in astrophysics, offering a scalable and data-driven approach for simulating systems with central accretors.

Abstract: Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.

TL;DR: This study benchmarks medical image-specific VLMs against radiologist-written reports for CXR and CT imaging assessments, showing AIRead performed closest to radiologists across multiple criteria, while other VLMs had variable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to assess the effectiveness and reliability of medical visual language models (VLMs) as alternatives or supplements to radiologist-written reports in real-world settings.

Method: Five VLMs (AIRead, Lingshu, MAIRA-2, MedGemma, MedVersa) were evaluated against radiologist-generated reports for adult patients who underwent CXR and CT scans. Criteria included RADPEER accuracy, clinical acceptability, hallucination frequency, and language clarity. Comparative performance was analyzed using statistical modeling.

Result: AIRead outperformed others, showing lower disagreement rates (5.3% RADPEER errors vs. radiologists' 13.9%) and higher clinical acceptability (84.5%) with minimal hallucinations. Other VLMs had higher rates of errors, hallucinations, but some matched or exceeded radiologists in language clarity.

Conclusion: Medical VLMs, especially AIRead, demonstrate potential for generating high-quality radiology reports, but their varying performances highlight the need for further refinement before broader adoption.

Abstract: Purpose: To benchmark open-source or commercial medical image-specific VLMs against real-world radiologist-written reports. Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who presented to the emergency department between January 2022 and April 2025 and underwent same-day CXR and CT for febrile or respiratory symptoms. Reports from five VLMs (AIRead, Lingshu, MAIRA-2, MedGemma, and MedVersa) and radiologist-written reports were randomly presented and blindly evaluated by three thoracic radiologists using four criteria: RADPEER, clinical acceptability, hallucination, and language clarity. Comparative performance was assessed using generalized linear mixed models, with radiologist-written reports treated as the reference. Finding-level analyses were also performed with CT as the reference. Results: A total of 478 patients (median age, 67 years [interquartile range, 50-78]; 282 men [59.0%]) were included. AIRead demonstrated the lowest RADPEER 3b rate (5.3% [76/1434] vs. radiologists 13.9% [200/1434]; P<.001), whereas other VLMs showed higher disagreement rates (16.8-43.0%; P<.05). Clinical acceptability was the highest with AIRead (84.5% [1212/1434] vs. radiologists 74.3% [1065/1434]; P<.001), while other VLMs performed worse (41.1-71.4%; P<.05). Hallucinations were rare with AIRead, comparable to radiologists (0.3% [4/1425]) vs. 0.1% [1/1425]; P=.21), but frequent with other models (5.4-17.4%; P<.05). Language clarity was higher with AIRead (82.9% [1189/1434]), Lingshu (88.0% [1262/1434]), and MedVersa (88.4% [1268/1434]) compared with radiologists (78.1% [1120/1434]; P<.05). Sensitivity varied substantially across VLMs for the common findings: AIRead, 15.5-86.7%; Lingshu, 2.4-86.7%; MAIRA-2, 6.0-72.0%; MedGemma, 4.8-76.7%; and MedVersa, 20.2-69.3%. Conclusion: Medical VLMs for CXR report generation exhibited variable performance in report quality and diagnostic measures.

### [857] [Disentangling Progress in Medical Image Registration: Beyond Trend-Driven Architectures towards Domain-Specific Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01913)
*Bailiang Jian,Jiazhen Pan,Rohit Jena,Morteza Ghahremani,Hongwei Bran Li,Daniel Rueckert,Christian Wachinger,Benedikt Wiestler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the relative influence of architectural trends versus domain-specific design principles in medical image registration and finds that domain-specific designs consistently outperform generic computational blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to determine whether future advancements in medical image registration should prioritize generic architectural trends or specialized domain-specific design principles.

Method: A modular framework was developed for systematic evaluation across brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration using existing components such as U-Nets and various computational blocks.

Result: High-level domain-specific design principles provide more consistent and significant gains in accuracy and robustness compared to low-level architectural trends, achieving superior performance improvements.

Conclusion: The paper suggests prioritizing domain-specific design principles over architectural trends for advancing learning-based medical image registration. A modular, open-source platform is provided to promote reproducibility and comparative studies.

Abstract: Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating "trend-driven" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\sim3\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (https://github.com/BailiangJ/rethink-reg). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.

### [858] [X-SYCON: Xylem-Inspired Passive Gradient Control for Communication-Free Swarm Response in Dynamic Disaster Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00018)
*Arthur Ji Sung Baek,Geoffrey Martin*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: X-SYCON creates decentralized coordination for agents using scalar field dynamics, inspired by xylem, achieving effective performance in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a decentralized, scalable solution for coordination in dynamic, communication-denied or constrained environments such as disaster response.

Method: Agents respond to scalar fields generated by demands and hazards, aiming to maximize a local utility function. A modified beaconing rule helps prioritize responses. The system uses principles of Distributed Passive Computation and Control.

Result: The proposed system achieves low miss rates, stable throughput, interpretable trade-offs, and sublinear capacity scaling. Empirical observations include better obstacle handling, improved reliability with additional carriers, and enhanced sink recruitment by strong arrivals.

Conclusion: X-SYCON effectively addresses coordination challenges in restricted scenarios by leveraging physics-inspired field dynamics, offering robust and tunable performance across various conditions.

Abstract: We present X-SYCON, a xylem-inspired multi-agent architecture in which coordination emerges from passive field dynamics rather than explicit planning or communication. Incidents (demands) and obstructions (hazards) continually write diffusing and decaying scalar fields, and agents greedily ascend a local utility $U=φ_{\mathrm{DE}}-κ\,φ_{\mathrm{HZ}}$ with light anti-congestion and separation. A beaconing rule triggered on first contact temporarily deepens the local demand sink, accelerating completion without reducing time-to-first-response. Across dynamic, partially blocked simulated environments, we observe low miss rates and stable throughput with interpretable, tunable trade-offs over carrier count, arrival rate, hazard density, and hazard sensitivity $κ$. We derive that a characteristic hydraulic length scale $\ell\approx\sqrt{D/λ}$ predicts recruitment range in a continuum approximation, and we provide a work-conservation (Ohm-law) bound consistent with sublinear capacity scaling with team size. Empirically: (i) soft hazard penalties yield fewer misses when obstacles already block motion; (ii) throughput saturates sublinearly with carriers while reliability improves sharply; (iii) stronger arrivals can reduce misses by sustaining sinks that recruit help; and (iv) phase-stability regions shrink with hazard density but are recovered by more carriers or higher arrivals. We refer to X-SYCON as an instance of Distributed Passive Computation and Control, and we evaluate it in simulations modeling communication-denied disaster response and other constrained sensing-action regimes.

*Junfeng Wu,Xiangmin Zhou,Erica Kuligowski,Dhirendra Singh,Enrico Ronchi,Max Kinateder*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Traditional data sources for bushfire evacuation have limitations, and social media offers opportunities to address these but has its own challenges. This study reviews data mining techniques and proposes their future applications and discusses unresolved issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of traditional methods for gathering bushfire evacuation data, such as cost, limited accuracy, and lack of context. It explores the potential of social media to provide better, faster, and more informative behavioural data.

Method: The paper conducts a scoping review of advancements in social media data mining techniques, analyzing their use in understanding bushfire evacuation behaviours.

Result: The review highlights potential applications of these techniques in evacuation model calibration, emergency communication, personalized training, and resource allocation. It also identifies significant issues such as data quality, bias, geolocation accuracy, and the need for enhanced contextual interpretation.

Conclusion: Social media can significantly enhance our understanding of bushfire evacuation behavior. However, the field faces challenges concerning data quality, representativeness, semantics, and multimodal analysis that need to be addressed for effective use.

Abstract: Traditional data sources on bushfire evacuation behaviour, such as quantitative surveys and manual observations have severe limitations. Mining social media data related to bushfire evacuations promises to close this gap by allowing the collection and processing of a large amount of behavioural data, which are low-cost, accurate, possibly including location information and rich contextual information. However, social media data have many limitations, such as being scattered, incomplete, informal, etc. Together, these limitations represent several challenges to their usefulness to better understand bushfire evacuation. To overcome these challenges and provide guidance on which and how social media data can be used, this scoping review of the literature reports on recent advances in relevant data mining techniques. In addition, future applications and open problems are discussed. We envision future applications such as evacuation model calibration and validation, emergency communication, personalised evacuation training, and resource allocation for evacuation preparedness. We identify open problems such as data quality, bias and representativeness, geolocation accuracy, contextual understanding, crisis-specific lexicon and semantics, and multimodal data interpretation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a stochastic theory to explain crackling-like avalanches observed in DNNs and demonstrates that activation function design influences their dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of mechanistic understanding behind crackling-like avalanche behavior in deep neural networks.

Method: It develops a stochastic theory of deep information propagation, characterized by four couplings, which describe avalanche dynamics through statistical and physical models such as Landau and Directed Percolation structures. Numerical simulations are used for validation.

Result: The theory identifies two universality classes of avalanche dynamics (Brownian Motion in a logarithmic trap and absorbed free BM) and links activation function design to random DNN dynamics.

Conclusion: The findings provide a mechanistic understanding of DNN avalanche phenomena, revealing that activation function design can control network dynamics, potentially leading to improved network architectures.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit crackling-like avalanches whose origin lacks a mechanistic explanation. Here, I derive a stochastic theory of deep information propagation (DIP) by incorporating Central Limit Theorem (CLT)-level fluctuations. Four effective couplings $(r, h, D_1, D_2)$ characterize the dynamics, yielding a Landau description of the static exponents and a Directed Percolation (DP) structure of activity cascades. Tuning the couplings selects between avalanche dynamics generated by a Brownian Motion (BM) in a logarithmic trap and an absorbed free BM, each corresponding to a distinct universality classes. Numerical simulations confirm the theory and demonstrate that activation function design controls the collective dynamics in random DNNs.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: This paper evaluates an alternative investment strategy in oil and gas exploration using Deep Reinforcement Learning, emphasizing early acquisition of high-quality data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve economic efficiency in oil and gas exploration and address shortcomings of the traditional "ladder-step" strategy.

Method: A multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning framework simulates an alternative strategy that front-loads information acquisition across the upstream value chain.

Result: The alternative strategy reduces redundant data costs, improves reserve valuation accuracy, and outperforms traditional methods in competitive environments.

Conclusion: Optimal investment timing depends more on market competition than price volatility, proposing a shift in how capital is allocated in extractive industries.

Abstract: Our work investigates the economic efficiency of the prevailing "ladder-step" investment strategy in oil and gas exploration, which advocates for the incremental acquisition of geological information throughout the project lifecycle. By employing a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, we model an alternative strategy that prioritizes the early acquisition of high-quality information assets. We simulate the entire upstream value chain-comprising competitive bidding, exploration, and development phases-to evaluate the economic impact of this approach relative to traditional methods. Our results demonstrate that front-loading information investment significantly reduces the costs associated with redundant data acquisition and enhances the precision of reserve valuation. Specifically, we find that the alternative strategy outperforms traditional methods in highly competitive environments by mitigating the "winner's curse" through more accurate bidding. Furthermore, the economic benefits are most pronounced during the development phase, where superior data quality minimizes capital misallocation. These findings suggest that optimal investment timing is structurally dependent on market competition rather than solely on price volatility, offering a new paradigm for capital allocation in extractive industries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge in theoretical studies of topologically ordered states, which are strongly correlated quantum phases, via a method bypassing the limitations of conventional mean-field approaches.

Method: The method involves employing an attention-based deep neural network variational Monte Carlo scheme to represent wavefunctions, minimizing energy for discovering ground states and introducing an approach to extract topological degeneracy from real-space wavefunctions.

Result: The study achieves discovery of fractional Chern insulator ground states with high accuracy without prior input and successfully extracts hallmark topological degeneracy properties of these systems.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that attention-based neural networks are a powerful, adaptable tool for studying topologically ordered quantum phases, paving the way for novel insights into strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: Topologically ordered states are among the most interesting quantum phases of matter that host emergent quasi-particles having fractional charge and obeying fractional quantum statistics. Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states purely through energy minimization without prior knowledge and achieves remarkable accuracy. We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors. Our results establish neural network variational Monte Carlo as a versatile tool for discovering strongly correlated topological phases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the issue of underspecified tasks and population representation in LLM persona-based experiments, noting the need for greater rigor and ecological validity.

Method: A review of 63 studies from 2023 to 2025 was conducted to analyze current practices in LLM persona experiments.

Result: The analysis found limited sociodemographic representation, with only 35% of studies addressing representativeness, leading to the development of a transparency checklist.

Conclusion: To enhance the rigor and ecological validity of persona-based LLM research, better sampling, grounding in data, and adherence to the proposed checklist are recommended.

Abstract: Synthetic personae experiments have become a prominent method in Large Language Model alignment research, yet the representativeness and ecological validity of these personae vary considerably between studies. Through a review of 63 peer-reviewed studies published between 2023 and 2025 in leading NLP and AI venues, we reveal a critical gap: task and population of interest are often underspecified in persona-based experiments, despite personalization being fundamentally dependent on these criteria. Our analysis shows substantial differences in user representation, with most studies focusing on limited sociodemographic attributes and only 35% discussing the representativeness of their LLM personae. Based on our findings, we introduce a persona transparency checklist that emphasizes representative sampling, explicit grounding in empirical data, and enhanced ecological validity. Our work provides both a comprehensive assessment of current practices and practical guidelines to improve the rigor and ecological validity of persona-based evaluations in language model alignment research.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores regulating AI agent user interfaces to enforce transparency and operational requirements, identifying key design patterns and offering policy recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents, acting autonomously over long periods, pose risks that require governance mechanisms. Existing measures target system and infrastructure safeguards, but user interface regulation offers a complementary approach.

Method: The authors analyzed 22 existing agentic systems, identifying UI elements critical to human-agent interactions and synthesizing these into six high-level, regulatory-focused interaction design patterns.

Result: Six interaction design patterns that could serve regulatory purposes were identified, such as making agent memory editable, providing insights into how UI elements are central to governance concerns.

Conclusion: The paper recommends policy approaches based on the analyzed patterns and highlights regulatory opportunities via user interface designs as additions to current governance strategies.

Abstract: AI agents that take actions in their environment autonomously over extended time horizons require robust governance interventions to curb their potentially consequential risks. Prior proposals for governing AI agents primarily target system-level safeguards (e.g., prompt injection monitors) or agent infrastructure (e.g., agent IDs). In this work, we explore a complementary approach: regulating user interfaces of AI agents as a way of enforcing transparency and behavioral requirements that then demand changes at the system and/or infrastructure levels. Specifically, we analyze 22 existing agentic systems to identify UI elements that play key roles in human-agent interaction and communication. We then synthesize those elements into six high-level interaction design patterns that hold regulatory potential (e.g., requiring agent memory to be editable). We conclude with policy recommendations based on our analysis. Our work exposes a new surface for regulatory action that supplements previous proposals for practical AI agent governance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces NOHARM, a benchmark for evaluating the clinical safety of large language models (LLMs) in providing medical recommendations, revealing frequent and severe harm instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of understanding regarding the clinical safety of LLMs despite their widespread adoption by healthcare professionals and patients.

Method: The authors developed NOHARM, a benchmark based on 100 real consultation cases, across 10 medical specialties with annotations for 4,249 clinical management options, to assess harm frequency and severity in LLM-generated recommendations.

Result: Severe harm occurred in up to 22.2% of the cases, with omissions accounting for 76.6% of errors. Safety was moderately correlated with existing benchmarks, and the best models outperformed physicians by 9.7% in safety.

Conclusion: Despite high performance on general benchmarks, LLMs can deliver clinically harmful advice at significant rates, necessitating the explicit measurement and emphasis on safety in their evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely used by physicians and patients for medical advice, yet their clinical safety profiles remain poorly characterized. We present NOHARM (Numerous Options Harm Assessment for Risk in Medicine), a benchmark using 100 real primary-care-to-specialist consultation cases to measure harm frequency and severity from LLM-generated medical recommendations. NOHARM covers 10 specialties, with 12,747 expert annotations for 4,249 clinical management options. Across 31 LLMs, severe harm occurs in up to 22.2% (95% CI 21.6-22.8%) of cases, with harms of omission accounting for 76.6% (95% CI 76.4-76.8%) of errors. Safety performance is only moderately correlated (r = 0.61-0.64) with existing AI and medical knowledge benchmarks. The best models outperform generalist physicians on safety (mean difference 9.7%, 95% CI 7.0-12.5%), and a diverse multi-agent approach reduces harm compared to solo models (mean difference 8.0%, 95% CI 4.0-12.1%). Therefore, despite strong performance on existing evaluations, widely used AI models can produce severely harmful medical advice at nontrivial rates, underscoring clinical safety as a distinct performance dimension necessitating explicit measurement.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to optimize haptic rendering for medical simulators using fractional-order viscoelastic models, which better mimic biological tissue properties and are optimized through human-in-the-loop optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the realism and training effectiveness of medical simulators by accurately replicating the viscoelastic properties of biological tissues using fractional-order models.

Method: Human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization is employed to determine fractional-order viscoelastic model parameters. Individual optimization results are aggregated to form perceptual maps that define parameters broadly perceived as realistic by general populations.

Result: The methodology significantly improves perceived realism in haptic rendering, as confirmed through human-subject experiments.

Conclusion: The approach enhances sim-to-real performance in medical simulators by leveraging optimized fractional-order viscoelastic models, offering a consistent perception of realism across general populations.

Abstract: Effective medical simulators necessitate realistic haptic rendering of biological tissues that display viscoelastic material properties, such as creep and stress relaxation. Fractional-order models provide an effective means of describing intrinsically time-dependent viscoelastic dynamics with few parameters, as these models can naturally capture memory effects. However, due to the unintuitive frequency-dependent coupling between the order of the fractional element and the other parameters, determining appropriate parameters for fractional-order models that yield high perceived realism remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a systematic means of determining the parameters of fractional-order viscoelastic models that optimizes the perceived realism of haptic rendering across general populations. First, we demonstrate that the parameters of fractional-order models can be effectively optimized through active learning, via qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop~(HiL) optimizations, to ensure consistently high realism ratings for each individual. Second, we propose a rigorous method to combine HiL optimization results to form an aggregate perceptual map trained on the entire dataset and demonstrate the selection of population-level optimal parameters from this representation that are broadly perceived as realistic across general populations. Finally, we provide evidence of the effectiveness of the generalized fractional-order viscoelastic model parameters by characterizing their perceived realism through human-subject experiments. Overall, generalized fractional-order viscoelastic models established through the proposed HiL optimization and aggregation approach possess the potential to significantly improve the sim-to-real transition performance of medical training simulators.

Result: BuilDa framework successfully generated synthetic data, enabling transfer learning through fine-tuning of 486 data-driven models.

Conclusion: BuilDa efficiently bridges the gap for quality datasets in ML-based building thermal dynamics research, eliminating the need for expert simulation knowledge.

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of building thermal dynamics is emerging as an increasingly important field of research for large-scale intelligent building control. However, research in data-driven modeling using machine learning (ML) techniques requires massive amounts of thermal building data, which is not easily available. Neither empirical public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of ML research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. To fill this gap, we present a thermal building data generation framework which we call BuilDa. BuilDa is designed to produce synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for ML research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for a transfer learning study involving the fine-tuning of 486 data-driven models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional and existing learning-based power flow analysis methods, such as inefficiencies, the dependence on labeled data, and struggles with maintaining physical consistency.

Method: Power flow equations are modeled as a constraint manifold with an energy function and corresponding gradient flow. Neural networks are trained in an unsupervised manner, directly minimizing physical residuals, ensuring a physics-constrained approach.

Result: The proposed method enables end-to-end learning without requiring labeled datasets, offering a more efficient and consistent solution to the power flow problem.

Conclusion: This new neural physics approach to power flow solving provides an innovative and efficient alternative, addressing the limitations of traditional and supervised deep learning methods while ensuring physical accuracy.

Abstract: Power flow analysis is a fundamental tool for power system analysis, planning, and operational control. Traditional Newton-Raphson methods suffer from limitations such as initial value sensitivity and low efficiency in batch computation, while existing deep learning-based power flow solvers mostly rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving of numerous cases and struggling to guarantee physical consistency. This paper proposes a neural physics power flow solving method based on manifold geometry and gradient flow, by describing the power flow equations as a constraint manifold, and constructing an energy function \(V(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x})\|^2\) and gradient flow \(\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = -\nabla V(\mathbf{x})\), transforming power flow solving into an equilibrium point finding problem for dynamical systems. Neural networks are trained in an unsupervised manner by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true "end-to-end" physics-constrained learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CALM, a framework addressing communication scheduling and state estimation issues to improve accuracy while balancing communication constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and bandwidth-constrained communication in networked systems.

Method: The proposed method, CALM, learns optimal communication schedules and extracts information from communication silences.

Result: Case studies show CALM improves estimation accuracy by decoding implicit coordination during communication silences.

Conclusion: CALM enhances state estimation in resource-constrained, networked dynamical systems by utilizing communication-aware strategies.

Abstract: Accurate remote state estimation is a fundamental component of many autonomous and networked dynamical systems, where multiple decision-making agents interact and communicate over shared, bandwidth-constrained channels. These communication constraints introduce an additional layer of complexity, namely, the decision of when to communicate. This results in a fundamental trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication resource usage. Traditional extensions of classical estimation algorithms (e.g., the Kalman filter) treat the absence of communication as 'missing' information. However, silence itself can carry implicit information about the system's state, which, if properly interpreted, can enhance the estimation quality even in the absence of explicit communication. Leveraging this implicit structure, however, poses significant analytical challenges, even in relatively simple systems. In this paper, we propose CALM (Communication-Aware Learning and Monitoring), a novel learning-based framework that jointly addresses the dual challenges of communication scheduling and estimator design. Our approach entails learning not only when to communicate but also how to infer useful information from periods of communication silence. We perform comparative case studies on multiple benchmarks to demonstrate that CALM is able to decode the implicit coordination between the estimator and the scheduler to extract information from the instances of 'silence' and enhance the estimation accuracy.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) which combines learning chaotic system dynamics and ensuring bounded predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chaotic dynamical systems are difficult to predict due to sensitivity to initial conditions. Statistical models for such systems need bounded predictions for robust evaluations.

Method: Authors use concepts from control theory to enforce dissipative dynamics. ECO employs a quadratic projection layer to implement bounded predictions through a learnable energy function.

Result: ECO successfully generates stable long-term forecasts and captures invariant statistics for chaotic systems governed by PDEs like Kuramoto--Sivashinsky and Navier--Stokes equations.

Conclusion: ECO provides a novel approach to model chaotic systems with provable boundedness guarantees and estimates for strange attractor structures, improving reliability in data-driven predictions.

Abstract: Chaos is a fundamental feature of many complex dynamical systems, including weather systems and fluid turbulence. These systems are inherently difficult to predict due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Many chaotic systems are dissipative and ergodic, motivating data-driven models that aim to learn invariant statistical properties over long time horizons. While recent models have shown empirical success in preserving invariant statistics, they are prone to generating unbounded predictions, which prevent meaningful statistics evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce the Energy-Constrained Operator (ECO) that simultaneously learns the system dynamics while enforcing boundedness in predictions. We leverage concepts from control theory to develop algebraic conditions based on a learnable energy function, ensuring the learned dynamics is dissipative. ECO enforces these algebraic conditions through an efficient closed-form quadratic projection layer, which provides provable trajectory boundedness. To our knowledge, this is the first work establishing such formal guarantees for data-driven chaotic dynamics models. Additionally, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, a complex structure that is computationally intractable to characterize. We demonstrate empirical success in ECO's ability to generate stable long-horizon forecasts, capturing invariant statistics on systems governed by chaotic PDEs, including the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky and the Navier--Stokes equations.

### [872] [AI-Driven Optimization under Uncertainty for Mineral Processing Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01977)
*William Xu,Amir Eskanlou,Mansur Arief,David Zhen Yin,Jef K. Caers*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper presents an AI-driven approach using POMDP for mineral processing, addressing uncertainty to optimize operations and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for efficient mineral processing is increasing due to the need for critical minerals to build clean energy technologies and address climate change.

Method: The paper formulates mineral processing as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), integrating uncertainty reduction and optimization techniques.

Result: The proposed approach consistently performs better than traditional methods in optimizing operations, as demonstrated in a simulated flotation cell example.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust framework for applying optimization-under-uncertainty in mineral processing, offering potential improvements in lab-scale and industrial-scale processes without extra hardware.

Abstract: The global capacity for mineral processing must expand rapidly to meet the demand for critical minerals, which are essential for building the clean energy technologies necessary to mitigate climate change. However, the efficiency of mineral processing is severely limited by uncertainty, which arises from both the variability of feedstock and the complexity of process dynamics. To optimize mineral processing circuits under uncertainty, we introduce an AI-driven approach that formulates mineral processing as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach in handling both feedstock uncertainty and process model uncertainty to optimize the operation of a simulated, simplified flotation cell as an example. We show that by integrating the process of information gathering (i.e., uncertainty reduction) and process optimization, this approach has the potential to consistently perform better than traditional approaches at maximizing an overall objective, such as net present value (NPV). Our methodological demonstration of this optimization-under-uncertainty approach for a synthetic case provides a mathematical and computational framework for later real-world application, with the potential to improve both the laboratory-scale design of experiments and industrial-scale operation of mineral processing circuits without any additional hardware.

### [873] [On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01067)
*Evan Dramko,Yizhi Zhu,Aleksandar Krivokapic,Geoffroy Hautier,Thomas Reps,Christopher Jermaine,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel fine-tuning method for pretrained machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to optimize structural relaxations directly. This method reduces test error significantly and requires less data for domain-specific applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional first-principles calculations for structural relaxations are computationally expensive. Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can be used to reduce computational costs, but their training methods need improvement for better efficiency and reliability.

Method: The paper introduces a fine-tuning framework with a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes predicted final structures directly by unrolling trajectories and tracking gradients throughout the relaxation process.

Result: This approach demonstrates a nearly 50% reduction in test error and robustness to variations in relaxation setup, including hyperparameter and procedural changes.

Conclusion: The method not only enhances MLIP performance but also minimizes data requirements for effective domain-specific MLIPs, making it a practical tool for material creation.

Abstract: Vital to the creation of advanced materials is performing structural relaxations. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment.

*Benhour Amirian,Ashley S. Dale,Sergei Kalinin,Jason Hattrick-Simpers*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper presents the GIFTERS framework for assessing AI trustworthiness in materials science and analyzes gaps in current research practices, proposing improvements from other fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of ensuring human trust in AI/ML applications in materials science and provide a framework for evaluating system trustworthiness.

Method: It introduces the GIFTERS framework (Generalizable, Interpretable, Fair, Transparent, Explainable, Robust, Stable), conducts a critical literature review of its adoption, and examines methods from other scientific fields to improve trustworthiness in AI/ML systems for materials discovery.

Result: The study finds a median GIFTERS score of 5/7 for reported methods, identifies gaps in fair data practices in Bayesian studies and interpretability in non-Bayesian studies, and suggests the importance of integrating knowledge from other fields.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with the necessity for human-in-the-loop and integrated approaches to bridge trust and uncertainty in AI/ML for materials science, ensuring ethical, reliable, and scientific advancements.

Abstract: Accelerated material discovery increasingly relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning, collectively termed "AI/ML". A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community. This work provides a road map for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence systems that will accurately and confidently enable material discovery.

*Yiqiao Chen,Zijian Huang,Juchi He,Fazheng Xu,Zhenghui Feng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework, GCMCG, for decoding Motor Execution and Imagery EEG signals with improved generalization and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance human-machine interaction using BCIs and address challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, spatio-temporal complexities of EEG signals, and limited cross-subject generalizability.

Method: The proposed GCMCG framework integrates ICA-WT denoising, a graph tokenization module with GAT and spectral clustering, CNN-GRU expert networks for brain region signals, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization for deep spatio-temporal fusion. A three-stage training strategy with focal loss and progressive sampling improves generalization.

Result: GCMCG demonstrated superior accuracy and generalization capability on three datasets: EEGmmidb-BCI2000 (86.60%), BCI-IV 2a (98.57%), and M3CV (99.61%).

Conclusion: GCMCG is highly effective for decoding MI-ME EEG signals, showing robust cross-subject generalization and practicality for BCI applications.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Motor Execution (ME) and Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals offer a direct pathway for human-machine interaction. However, developing robust decoding models remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG, its low signal-to-noise ratio, and the limited generalizability of many existing approaches across subjects and paradigms. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph-guided Clustering Mixture-of-Experts CNN-GRU (GCMCG), a novel unified framework for MI-ME EEG decoding. Our approach integrates a robust preprocessing stage using Independent Component Analysis and Wavelet Transform (ICA-WT) for effective denoising. We further introduce a pre-trainable graph tokenization module that dynamically models electrode relationships via a Graph Attention Network (GAT), followed by unsupervised spectral clustering to decompose signals into interpretable functional brain regions. Each region is processed by a dedicated CNN-GRU expert network, and a gated fusion mechanism with L1 regularization adaptively combines these local features with a global expert. This Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design enables deep spatio-temporal fusion and enhances representational capacity. A three-stage training strategy incorporating focal loss and progressive sampling is employed to improve cross-subject generalization and handle class imbalance. Evaluated on three public datasets of varying complexity (EEGmmidb-BCI2000, BCI-IV 2a, and M3CV), GCMCG achieves overall accuracies of 86.60%, 98.57%, and 99.61%, respectively, which demonstrates its superior effectiveness and strong generalization capability for practical BCI applications.

*Yunchuan Zhang,Jiechen Chen,Junshuo Liu,Robert C. Qiu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPR-UCB, a Bayesian optimization strategy, to address resource allocation challenges in cellular networks by approximating stable outcomes (pure Nash equilibrium).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve the intricate issue of efficient resource allocation coordination across base stations in cellular networks, which is complex due to conflicting utilities and costly evaluations.

Method: The authors propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization approach that utilizes Gaussian processes and high probability confidence bounds via martingale techniques to navigate toward pure Nash equilibrium solutions efficiently.

Result: Experiments on downlink power allocation in multi-antenna systems show that PPR-UCB efficiently finds equilibrium solutions using minimal data samples.

Conclusion: PPR-UCB effectively aligns conflicting allocation incentives across base stations by approximating stability in resource allocation, demonstrating the potential for improved cellular network management.

Abstract: Radio resource management in modern cellular networks often calls for the optimization of complex utility functions that are potentially conflicting between different base stations (BSs). Coordinating the resource allocation strategies efficiently across BSs to ensure stable network service poses significant challenges, especially when each utility is accessible only via costly, black-box evaluations. This paper considers formulating the resource allocation among spectrum sharing BSs as a non-cooperative game, with the goal of aligning their allocation incentives toward a stable outcome. To address this challenge, we propose PPR-UCB, a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy that learns from sequential decision-evaluation pairs to approximate pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) solutions. PPR-UCB applies martingale techniques to Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and constructs high probability confidence bounds for utilities uncertainty quantification. Experiments on downlink transmission power allocation in a multi-cell multi-antenna system demonstrate the efficiency of PPR-UCB in identifying effective equilibrium solutions within a few data samples.

*Song Zhang,Ruohan Guo,Xiaohua Ge,Perter Mahon,Weixiang Shen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Reliable health assessment methods for retired lithium-ion batteries are needed for their safe second-life use, but current approaches are impractical at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges associated with health assessment for retired lithium-ion batteries, focusing on the difficulties of sparse data, inconsistent measurements, and heterogeneous chemistries.

Method: The study reviews and synthesizes recent advancements in physical indicators, experimental testing, data augmentation, and machine learning-based modeling methods for health assessment.

Result: Advances in synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction were identified, aiding health assessments under constrained conditions and mixed chemistries.

Conclusion: Future improvements in generative models, chemistry generalization, uncertainty calibration, and standardized benchmarks are essential for scalable and reliable battery health prediction solutions.

Abstract: Reliable health assessment of retired lithium-ion batteries is essential for safe and economically viable second-life deployment, yet remains difficult due to sparse measurements, incomplete historical records, heterogeneous chemistries, and limited or noisy battery health labels. Conventional laboratory diagnostics, such as full charge-discharge cycling, pulse tests, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and thermal characterization, provide accurate degradation information but are too time-consuming, equipment-intensive, or condition-sensitive to be applied at scale during retirement-stage sorting, leaving real-world datasets fragmented and inconsistent. This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories. A comparative evaluation further reveals trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and computational burden. Looking forward, progress toward physically constrained generative models, cross-chemistry generalization, calibrated uncertainty estimation, and standardized benchmarks will be crucial for building reliable, scalable, and deployment-ready health prediction tools tailored to the realities of retired-battery applications.

### [878] [Masked Symbol Modeling for Demodulation of Oversampled Baseband Communication Signals in Impulsive Noise-Dominated Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01428)
*Oguz Bedir,Nurullah Sevim,Mostafa Ibrahim,Sabit Ekin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework using Transformer networks to interpret inter-symbol contribution (ISC) in communication signals and demonstrates its application in noise-corrupted signal demodulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore context within physical communication waveforms and treat inter-symbol contribution (ISC) as an informative source rather than a nuisance.

Method: The paper proposes Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), utilizing a Transformer network to mask and predict symbol identifiers, enabling the model to learn latent syntax of waveforms.

Result: The MSM approach effectively leverages learned context to demodulate signals corrupted by impulsive noise.

Conclusion: The work presents a pathway towards designing context-aware PHY layers, showcasing a novel perspective of interpreting rather than merely detecting signals in communication systems.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing show that attention mechanism in Transformer networks, trained via masked-token prediction, enables models to capture the semantic context of the tokens and internalize the grammar of language. While the application of Transformers to communication systems is a burgeoning field, the notion of context within physical waveforms remains under-explored. This paper addresses that gap by re-examining inter-symbol contribution (ISC) caused by pulse-shaping overlap. Rather than treating ISC as a nuisance, we view it as a deterministic source of contextual information embedded in oversampled complex baseband signals. We propose Masked Symbol Modeling (MSM), a framework for the physical (PHY) layer inspired by Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers methodology. In MSM, a subset of symbol aligned samples is randomly masked, and a Transformer predicts the missing symbol identifiers using the surrounding "in-between" samples. Through this objective, the model learns the latent syntax of complex baseband waveforms. We illustrate MSM's potential by applying it to the task of demodulating signals corrupted by impulsive noise, where the model infers corrupted segments by leveraging the learned context. Our results suggest a path toward receivers that interpret, rather than merely detect communication signals, opening new avenues for context-aware PHY layer design.

*Yiqiao Chen,Fazheng Xu,Zijian Huang,Juchi He,Zhenghui Feng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study introduces a novel six-modal framework for cuffless blood pressure monitoring that demonstrates high accuracy across various motion states, meeting clinical standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current cuffless BP estimation systems, which often fail under dynamic conditions and rely on limited signal modalities.

Method: A six-modal BP estimation framework is proposed, utilizing ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Lightweight encoders, contrastive learning for cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts regression head are employed.

Result: The method achieves mean absolute errors of 3.60 mmHg for SBP and 3.01 mmHg for DBP across motion states and satisfies clinical standards like BHS Grade A and AAMI criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers robust accuracy across varied physical activities, demonstrating its potential for real-world continuous blood pressure monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and sustained hypertension is an often silent risk factor, making cuffless continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring with wearable devices important for early screening and long-term management. Most existing cuffless BP estimation methods use only photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals, alone or in combination. These models are typically developed under resting or quasi-static conditions and struggle to maintain robust accuracy in multi-motion-state scenarios. In this study, we propose a six-modal BP estimation framework that jointly leverages ECG, multi-channel PPG, attachment pressure, sensor temperature, and triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Each modality is processed by a lightweight branch encoder, contrastive learning enforces cross-modal semantic alignment, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) regression head adaptively maps the fused features to BP across motion states. Comprehensive experiments on the public Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset, which includes running, walking, and sitting data from 22 subjects, show that the proposed method achieves mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.60 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and 3.01 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). From a clinical perspective, it attains Grade A for SBP, DBP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol and meets the numerical criteria of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for mean error (ME) and standard deviation of error (SDE).

*Kai Zhang,Wentao Yu,Hengtao He,Shenghui Song,Jun Zhang,Khaled B. Letaief*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), improving adaptation and performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal fusion approaches in ISAC for LAWNs lack adaptability to channel heterogeneity and changing modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments.

Method: The authors introduced an MoE framework where each sensing modality has a dedicated expert network. A gating module adaptively assigns weights based on the informativeness and reliability of each modality. A sparse MoE variant is also developed to reduce computational load by activating only selected expert networks.

Result: The proposed MoE frameworks achieved better performance and training efficiency compared to conventional multimodal fusion methods in three simulated ISAC tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enhances ISAC functionality in dynamic and energy-constrained LAWNs while achieving efficient and adaptive multimodal data fusion.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), providing simultaneous environmental perception and data transmission in complex aerial scenarios. By combining heterogeneous sensing modalities such as visual, radar, lidar, and positional information, multimodal ISAC can improve both situational awareness and robustness of LAWNs. However, most existing multimodal fusion approaches use static fusion strategies that treat all modalities equally and cannot adapt to channel heterogeneity or time-varying modality reliability in dynamic low-altitude environments. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for multimodal ISAC in LAWNs. Each modality is processed by a dedicated expert network, and a lightweight gating module adaptively assigns fusion weights according to the instantaneous informativeness and reliability of each modality. To improve scalability under the stringent energy constraints of aerial platforms, we further develop a sparse MoE variant that selectively activates only a subset of experts, thereby reducing computation overhead while preserving the benefits of adaptive fusion. Comprehensive simulations on three typical ISAC tasks in LAWNs demonstrate that the proposed frameworks consistently outperform conventional multimodal fusion baselines in terms of learning performance and training sample efficiency.

*Hui Zhong,Jiachen Shen,Lei Fan,Xinyue Zhang,Hao Wang,Miao Pan,Zhu Han*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces UNIQ, an optimization framework for distributed quantum computing that unifies qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling to reduce communication costs and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations in distributed quantum computing caused by the high communication cost and inefficiency of current methods, which treat critical components independently.

Method: The paper proposes the UNIQ framework that formulates the optimization as a non-linear integer programming problem, applies a greedy algorithm for qubit mapping, and utilizes a Just-In-Time (JIT) approach for parallel EPR pair generation.

Result: Simulations show that UNIQ significantly reduces communication costs and runtime across various quantum circuits and configurations, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that an integrated approach to optimizing distributed quantum computing can effectively enhance efficiency and scalability, making it applicable to diverse quantum environments.

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is widely regarded as a promising approach to overcome quantum hardware limitations. A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper studies smaller many-hypercube quantum error-detecting codes which enable earlier experimental realizations while maintaining low logical error rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of large code block sizes at high concatenation levels in existing many-hypercube codes, making practical implementation and low logical errors challenging.

Method: The authors investigate alternative many-hypercube code configurations using $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes. They introduce efficient, fault-tolerant encoders and compare performance numerically under a circuit-level noise model.

Result: Smaller many-hypercube codes, such as $D_{6,4,4}$, achieve lower block error rates and reduced overhead compared to original designs, along with better performance for logical controlled-NOT gates.

Conclusion: These optimized configurations and encoding strategies show potential for earlier implementation and reliability in fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.

Abstract: Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.

TL;DR: The paper explores solving the NP-hard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem using an energy-based optimization method on non-von Neumann architectures, specifically the Dirac-3 device.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find alternative ways to solve the NP-hard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) problem using emerging architectures like non-von Neumann systems, such as the Dirac-3, for potential computational advantages.

Method: The authors use the Dirac-3 device to propose two formulations: a QUBO model for Ising-compatible machines and a quartic formulation for real and integer variables. They conduct experiments using a fusion approach and compare it to existing methods.

Result: For non-negative real matrices, the fusion approach of Dirac-3's output with Scikit-learn's NMF improves reconstruction error. For non-negative integer matrices, Dirac-3 outperforms Google's CP-SAT solver in some cases during serial processing.

Conclusion: The results suggest promise in using entropy computing and similar architectures for problems like NMF, though the work highlights the need for further research to identify areas where such approaches can excel.

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a matrix decomposition problem with applications in unsupervised learning. The general form of this problem (along with many of its variants) is NP-hard in nature. In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases. We believe that future work in this area might be able to identify domains and variants of the problem where entropy computing (and other non-von Neumann architectures) could offer a clear advantage.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores Hilbert space fragmentation and demonstrates that the Schur transform can be efficiently learned using quantum neural networks under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Hilbert space fragmentation and provide a framework for efficiently learning the Schur transform in fragmented systems using quantum neural networks.

Method: The authors analyze loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks, proving the elimination of barren plateaus and local minima under strong fragmentation. Gradient descent is utilized to learn the transformation from training data.

Result: Efficient trainability of quantum neural networks through gradient descent is demonstrated, assuming strong fragmentation. Classical algorithms do not appear viable for simulation of expectation values in this case.

Conclusion: The study identifies a physically motivated quantum learning task with efficient quantum trainability and no known classical dequantization methods.

Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation is a phenomenon in which the Hilbert space of a quantum system is dynamically decoupled into exponentially many Krylov subspaces. We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization.

Result: By applying the method to random quantum circuits, the study reveals a learnability transition based on circuit depth. This transition is experimentally validated on current noisy quantum devices, showcasing robustness to noise.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of data-driven approaches for learning MIE efficiently and provide insights into the limits of its classical learnability.

Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces QVerifier, a method to formally verify the safety of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) policies under quantum noise using probabilistic model checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic method for verifying the safety of QRL policies under quantum uncertainties and hardware noise, which can lead to unsafe behavior.

Method: The authors propose QVerifier, which builds a probabilistic model of policy-environment interaction incorporating quantum uncertainty, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.

Result: Experiments show that QVerifier accurately assesses the influence of different noise models on the safety of QRL policies, revealing performance issues as well as instances where noise can improve behavior.

Conclusion: QVerifier enables pre-deployment safety verification of trained QRL policies, addressing critical needs for safety-critical use cases, particularly given the high cost of quantum hardware.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) aims to use quantum effects to create sequential decision-making policies that achieve tasks more effectively than their classical counterparts. However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.
  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.
  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment.

TL;DR: The study applies dimensionality reduction to enable quantum machine learning algorithms to handle high-dimensional data, showing superior performance with an autoencoder model for analyzing particle physics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data sets are not suitable for quantum machine learning. To address this limitation, dimensionality reduction methods are explored to prepare data for quantum algorithms.

Method: Six conventional feature extraction methods and five autoencoder models were applied to a 67-feature particle physics data set. Quantum support vector machines were used for a binary classification problem of identifying Higgs boson production.

Result: Autoencoder models outperformed conventional methods. The custom Sinkclass autoencoder achieved a 40% improvement over the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed methods expand the capability of quantum machine learning for diverse datasets and provide a guide for effective dimensionality reduction in quantum contexts.

Abstract: Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context.
