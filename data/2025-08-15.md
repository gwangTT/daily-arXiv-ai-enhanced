*Alexandru-Andrei Avram,Adrian Groza,Alexandru Lecu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven multi-agent system leveraging relation extraction to detect disinformation in news titles and snippets, achieving impressive accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the widespread issue of disinformation across digital platforms, which undermines the integrity of information.

Method: A multi-agent system incorporating four specialized agents (logistic regression, Wikipedia knowledge check, coherence detection via LLM, and a web scraper for fact-checking), coordinated through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Result: The proposed system achieved 95.3% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.964, outperforming traditional methods and standalone agents.

Conclusion: The scalable modular architecture of the multi-agent system enhances accuracy in disinformation detection, showcasing the benefit of ensemble approaches in this domain.

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

### [5] [Improving and Evaluating Open Deep Research Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10152)
*Doaa Allabadi,Kyle Bradbury,Jordan M. Malof*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) on a new benchmark (BC-Small) and introduces improvements to an open-source DRA, achieving a notable performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open-source systems and benchmarks for evaluating the capabilities of Deep Research Agents (DRAs) while fostering research in academic labs.

Method: The researchers adapted the BrowseComp benchmark to create a smaller, computationally feasible benchmark called BC-Small. They evaluated three DRAs—an open-source system (ODR) and two proprietary systems—on BC-Small and introduced three key improvements to ODR.

Result: All three systems initially failed the test set (0% accuracy). However, the improved ODR+ model achieved a 10% success rate, becoming the best-performing system for this task.

Conclusion: The advancements in ODR+ demonstrate the potential for improving open-source DRAs to compete with proprietary systems, despite the challenges in achieving high accuracy on benchmarks like BC-Small.

Abstract: We focus here on Deep Research Agents (DRAs), which are systems that can take
a natural language prompt from a user, and then autonomously search for, and
utilize, internet-based content to address the prompt. Recent DRAs have
demonstrated impressive capabilities on public benchmarks however, recent
research largely involves proprietary closed-source systems. At the time of
this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

### [6] [Pruning Long Chain-of-Thought of Large Reasoning Models via Small-Scale Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10164)
*Bin Hong,Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to efficiently reduce the output length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) without compromising reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning achieve strong performance but raise concerns regarding computational costs and potential overthinking.

Method: The authors introduce Length Controlled Preference Optimization (LCPO), which utilizes a Bradley-Terry loss framework to balance reasoning length and quality efficiently.

Result: LCPO reduces output length by over 50% across benchmarks while keeping reasoning performance intact.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning in LRMs can be achieved with LCPO, making it possible to perform complex tasks with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

### [7] [CVCM Track Circuits Pre-emptive Failure Diagnostics for Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09054)
*Debdeep Mukherjee,Eduardo Di Santi,Clément Lefebvre,Nenad Mijatovic,Victor Martin,Thierry Josse,Jonathan Brown,Kenza Saiah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning-based predictive maintenance framework to classify subtle anomalous signals in railway track circuits before failures occur, achieving 99.31% accuracy and providing confidence estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Track circuit failures in railway systems are critical, as they disrupt operations and create revenue losses. Early detection of anomalies is needed to improve maintenance planning and prevent cascading failures.

Method: A predictive maintenance framework using deep neural networks, validated on 10 cases of CVCM failures, provides 99.31% accuracy and includes conformal prediction for uncertainty estimation.

Result: The method achieved early anomaly detection within 1% anomaly onset, surpassing conventional techniques with consistent confidence estimates of 99% and ISO-17359 compliance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is scalable for global deployment, adaptable to other systems, and enhances railway reliability by addressing subtle signal anomalies through predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

### [8] [KompeteAI: Accelerated Autonomous Multi-Agent System for End-to-End Pipeline Generation for Machine Learning Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10177)
*Stepan Kulibaba,Artem Dzhalilov,Roman Pakhomov,Oleg Svidchenko,Alexander Gasnikov,Aleksei Shpilman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KompeteAI addresses shortcomings in LLM-based AutoML frameworks by enhancing exploration with solution merging and real-world strategies, and mitigating execution bottlenecks through predictive scoring and debugging acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current LLM-based AutoML systems, including restricted exploration strategies and slow execution due to validation cycles.

Method: Introduced KompeteAI, which includes solution merging, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for diverse input, predictive scoring models, and accelerated debugging methods.

Result: KompeteAI speeds pipeline evaluation by 6.9 times and outperforms competing AutoML methods by 3% on the MLE-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: KompeteAI offers state-of-the-art performance and addresses critical issues in existing AutoML frameworks; it sets a new standard by overcoming both exploration and execution challenges in AutoML.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

### [9] [Extending the Entropic Potential of Events for Uncertainty Quantification and Decision-Making in Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10241)
*Mark Zilberman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of 'entropic potential' to measure the impact of discrete events on future uncertainty, offering applications in AI for decision-making and interpretable systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt the physics-based concept of entropic potential for use in AI systems, enhancing tools for uncertainty modeling and interpretability.

Method: Entropic potential is formalized for AI by measuring the impact of actions or observations on future uncertainty using conditional expectations and counterfactual scenarios.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates the utility of entropic potential in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, with examples in reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference.

Conclusion: Entropic potential is a versatile and interpretable way to model uncertainty in AI, connecting thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning principles to advance intelligent systems.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

### [10] [Why Cannot Large Language Models Ever Make True Correct Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10265)
*Jingde Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper argues that large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, do not possess true understanding or reasoning abilities due to fundamental theoretical limitations in their design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misconceptions surrounding the capabilities of LLMs and to clarify that their perceived understanding and reasoning abilities are merely illusions.

Method: The paper discusses the theoretical working principles and inherent limitations of LLMs, offering an explanation as to why they cannot perform true reasoning.

Result: It demonstrates that LLMs are incapable of true correct reasoning due to the constraints of their operational framework.

Conclusion: The apparent reasoning abilities of LLMs are illusory, and these systems cannot achieve genuine understanding or reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Recently, with the application progress of AIGC tools based on large language
models (LLMs), led by ChatGPT, many AI experts and more non-professionals are
trumpeting the "understanding ability" and "reasoning ability" of the LLMs. The
present author considers that the so-called "understanding ability" and
"reasoning ability" of LLMs are just illusions of those people who with vague
concepts. In fact, the LLMs can never have the true understanding ability and
true reasoning ability. This paper intents to explain that, because the
essential limitations of their working principle, the LLMs can never have the
ability of true correct reasoning.

### [11] [Promoting Efficient Reasoning with Verifiable Stepwise Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10293)
*Chuhuai Yue,Chengqi Dong,Yinan Gao,Hang He,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of overthinking in large reasoning models and proposes a stepwise reward mechanism that balances efficiency and accuracy in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models waste computational resources on simple problems due to overthinking. Existing methods lack flexibility and reliability because they depend on accurate task assessment to optimize efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces a rule-based verifiable stepwise reward mechanism (VSRM) which distributes rewards for reasoning tasks based on the performance of intermediate steps, encouraging effective reasoning while penalizing ineffective steps.

Result: Experiments on math benchmarks such as AIME24 and AIME25 show VSRM reduces reasoning output length and maintains reasoning accuracy. It effectively suppresses overthinking while promoting efficiency.

Conclusion: VSRM fundamentally reduces overthinking without compromising reasoning quality, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper details their first-place solution for Task 1 and strong performance in Tasks 2 and 3 of the META CRAG-MM challenge, focusing on building a retrieval-augmented system for multi-modal multi-turn question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a robust retrieval-augmented generation system that can answer multi-turn multi-modal questions by combining structured knowledge from images, web searches, and contextual conversations.

Method: For Task 1, they employed a vision-based large language model with supervised fine-tuning and knowledge distillation from GPT-4. Reinforcement learning with curriculum learning was introduced to enhance accuracy and reduce hallucinations. For Tasks 2 and 3, web search APIs were integrated to include external knowledge for better performance in complex queries.

Result: Their approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a notable lead (52.38%) and 3rd place in Task 3, proving the effectiveness of combining curriculum learning with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The results underline the success of integrating curriculum learning and reinforcement learning in large-scale retrieval-augmented systems for multi-modal question answering, with significant contributions to Task 1 and competitive results in other tasks.

Abstract: This paper describes the solutions of the Dianping-Trust-Safety team for the
META CRAG-MM challenge. The challenge requires building a comprehensive
retrieval-augmented generation system capable for multi-modal multi-turn
question answering. The competition consists of three tasks: (1) answering
questions using structured data retrieved from an image-based mock knowledge
graph, (2) synthesizing information from both knowledge graphs and web search
results, and (3) handling multi-turn conversations that require context
understanding and information aggregation from multiple sources. For Task 1,
our solution is based on the vision large language model, enhanced by
supervised fine-tuning with knowledge distilled from GPT-4.1. We further
applied curriculum learning strategies to guide reinforcement learning,
resulting in improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucination. For Task 2 and
Task 3, we additionally leveraged web search APIs to incorporate external
knowledge, enabling the system to better handle complex queries and multi-turn
conversations. Our approach achieved 1st place in Task 1 with a significant
lead of 52.38\%, and 3rd place in Task 3, demonstrating the effectiveness of

### [13] [Multi-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimisation: A Joint Constraint Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10340)
*Chak Lam Shek,Guangyao Shi,Pratap Tokekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two approaches to improve the Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (HATRPO) for better multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving over 22.5% improvement in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HATRPO methods assign the same KL divergence threshold to all agents, leading to slower updates and suboptimality in heterogeneous-agent settings.

Method: The paper presents two methods: HATRPO-W, which uses KKT optimization for global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy algorithm based on an improvement-to-divergence ratio for assigning KL divergence thresholds.

Result: Both methods show faster convergence and higher rewards in MARL benchmarks, achieving more than a 22.5% improvement. HATRPO-W specifically demonstrated stable learning with lower variance.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches enhance HATRPO's efficiency and stability in heterogeneous-agent scenarios, offering significant performance gains.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Conclusion: LLMs show clear deficits in imaginative reasoning. The introduced framework can serve as a basis for exploring and improving exploratory agent behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

### [15] [LeanRAG: Knowledge-Graph-Based Generation with Semantic Aggregation and Hierarchical Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10391)
*Yaoze Zhang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xiaoman Wang,Guohang Yan,Song Mao,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanRAG is an improved framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that addresses inefficiencies in retrieval processes and enhances contextual information by leveraging semantic networks and structure-guided strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods do not adequately resolve issues like incomplete context retrieval and lack explicit cross-community relations needed for advanced reasoning.

Method: LeanRAG introduces semantic aggregation to form entity clusters with explicit relations and employs structure-guided retrieval to efficiently traverse these networks for precise evidence gathering.

Result: In experiments on QA benchmarks across domains, LeanRAG significantly improves response quality and reduces retrieval redundancy by 46%.

Conclusion: LeanRAG provides a robust improvement over traditional RAG methods, offering a more efficient retrieval framework that enhances evidence quality while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

### [16] [HiRef: Leveraging Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for Robust Medication Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10425)
*Yan Ting Chok,Soyon Park,Seungheun Baek,Hajung Kim,Junhyun Lee,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiRef is a robust medication recommendation framework combining hierarchical medical ontologies and refined EHR co-occurrence patterns to improve generalizability and accuracy under realistic, incomplete data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of data-driven models in handling rare medical entities and incomplete EHRs, which fail to generalize under missing or novel conditions.

Method: HiRef combines hierarchical semantics from medical ontologies (embedded in hyperbolic space for better knowledge transfer) and sparsified EHR co-occurrence graphs (via prior-guided regularization) to improve robustness in medication recommendation.

Result: HiRef achieves strong benchmark performance (MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV), maintains accuracy under unseen-code simulations, and provides meaningful refinements in EHR graph structures and medical code embeddings through experiments.

Conclusion: HiRef is effective and resilient for real-world EHR challenges, improving medication recommendation accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Conclusion: MM-Food-100K is a public resource for AI research in food-related domains, with plans for a commercial model leveraging revenue-sharing with contributors.

Abstract: We present MM-Food-100K, a public 100,000-sample multimodal food intelligence
dataset with verifiable provenance. It is a curated approximately 10% open
subset of an original 1.2 million, quality-accepted corpus of food images
annotated for a wide range of information (such as dish name, region of
creation). The corpus was collected over six weeks from over 87,000
contributors using the Codatta contribution model, which combines community
sourcing with configurable AI-assisted quality checks; each submission is
linked to a wallet address in a secure off-chain ledger for traceability, with
a full on-chain protocol on the roadmap. We describe the schema, pipeline, and
QA, and validate utility by fine-tuning large vision-language models (ChatGPT
5, ChatGPT OSS, Qwen-Max) on image-based nutrition prediction. Fine-tuning
yields consistent gains over out-of-box baselines across standard metrics; we
report results primarily on the MM-Food-100K subset. We release MM-Food-100K
for publicly free access and retain approximately 90% for potential commercial
access with revenue sharing to contributors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mathematical reasoning tasks for MLLMs lack comprehensive knowledge design and model-centric data space modeling, limiting their capabilities.

Method: The study builds a hierarchical knowledge system, designs standard and progressive challenging datasets, leverages a two-phase RL training paradigm, and sets up a thorough evaluation benchmark.

Result: We-Math 2.0 achieves strong generalization in mathematical reasoning, competing with existing baselines and excelling on a comprehensive evaluation covering diverse reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By integrating structured knowledge and advanced training methods, We-Math 2.0 significantly improves mathematical reasoning ability in MLLMs and sets the stage for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

*Xueli Pan,Victor de Boer,Jacco van Ossenbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIRESPARQL, a modular framework addressing challenges in generating SPARQL queries for scholarly knowledge graphs using fine-tuned LLMs, achieving high accuracy through fine-tuning and additional enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to tackle challenges in question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) due to the complexity of such content and structure, and the limitations of LLMs in generating precise SPARQL queries.

Method: The paper proposes FIRESPARQL, a framework using fine-tuned LLMs with optional context via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. It evaluates the framework using various configurations like zero-shot, fine-tuning, and RAG.

Result: FIRESPARQL, particularly through fine-tuning, achieves exceptional performance, including 0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy in the SciQA Benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses structural inconsistencies and semantic inaccuracies in SPARQL query generation for scholarly knowledge graphs, with fine-tuning being the most effective approach.

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the
test set.

*Ivan Khai Ze Lim,Ningyi Liao,Yiming Yang,Gerald Wei Yong Yip,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SEQ-GPT, a system using Large Language Models (LLMs) for more advanced spatial searches based on user examples and dynamic interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial services are limited in handling complex tasks like finding groups of locations simultaneously, prompting the need for more interactive and flexible systems.

Method: The authors developed SEQ-GPT, combining natural language processing via LLMs with a pipeline to align language queries with structured spatial data by using dialogue synthesis and multi-model cooperation.

Result: SEQ-GPT facilitates versatile and interactive SEQ processes, allowing query adjustments based on user feedback and realistic spatial search applications.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of LLMs to extend the limits of spatial search queries, improving user interaction and broadening spatial service functionality.

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

### [21] [Reverse Physician-AI Relationship: Full-process Clinical Diagnosis Driven by a Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10492)
*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DxDirector-7B, a large language model designed to independently drive the clinical diagnostic process from ambiguous complaints, achieving better accuracy and reducing physician workload compared to existing solutions. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that current medical AI, including LLMs, only assists specific parts of the diagnostic process, leaving physicians to handle the broader workflow. This limits efficiency and fails to substantially reduce physician workload.

Method: DxDirector-7B is equipped with deep thinking capabilities to handle full-process clinical diagnosis independently, with minimal physician involvement. It also includes an accountability framework for misdiagnoses.

Result: DxDirector-7B demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, reduced physician workload, and outperformed state-of-the-art medical and general-purpose LLMs in rare, complex, and real-world cases.

Conclusion: The study suggests that repositioning AI as the primary driver in the diagnostic process can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy, potentially serving as a substitute for medical specialists and ushering in a transformative era for healthcare.

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling) is a new framework aimed at improving decision-making in Chest X-Ray analysis by addressing challenges in tool-augmented agent systems such as trust, multimodal integration, and rigidity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems suffer from issues like lack of transparency, inadequate multimodal data handling, and inefficiency, particularly in critical domains like healthcare.

Method: PASS uses a probabilistic and adaptive workflow sampling across a tool graph. It integrates interpretable probabilities, personalized memory compression, and a three-stage training protocol to enhance decision-making in multimodal CXR analysis.

Result: PASS demonstrates superior performance on metrics such as accuracy and AUC while balancing computational costs, outperforming existing systems in rigorous benchmarking scenarios.

Conclusion: PASS redefines the paradigm for medical AI agent systems by focusing on transparency, adaptability, and multimodal capabilities, particularly in safety-critical healthcare contexts.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

### [23] [Diversity First, Quality Later: A Two-Stage Assumption for Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10530)
*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of static and on-policy preference data for aligning language models with human preferences. It introduces the 'alignment stage assumption' to explain observed disparities and proposes a method to identify the transition between alignment stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences, which is critical for building reliable AI systems. Despite the progress in this area, discrepancies in the effectiveness of static versus on-policy preference data require explanation and optimization.

Method: The authors propose the 'alignment stage assumption,' which segregates the alignment process into two stages: preference injection (favoring diverse data) and preference fine-tuning (favoring high-quality data). They employ theoretical and empirical analysis to characterize these stages and develop an algorithm to identify stage boundaries.

Result: The paper finds systematic differences in data effectiveness between static and on-policy preferences, with variations depending on the model used. For instance, on-policy data leads to 3x effectiveness in Llama-3 but only 0.4x in Zephyr. The proposed assumption and algorithm generalize effectively across five models and two alignment methods.

Conclusion: The alignment stage assumption provides insights into optimizing the alignment process for LMs, highlighting the importance of stage-specific data characteristics. The findings and proposed algorithms can guide future alignment strategies across diverse models and methods.

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using a novel variance-reduction method called Compound Monte Carlo Sampling (ComMCS), which enhances the accuracy of estimating probabilities of correct reasoning chains without additional costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs, particularly for mathematical tasks, by tackling the estimation error in value-based process verifiers caused by high variance in Monte Carlo (MC) sampling.

Method: The authors propose the ComMCS method, which reduces variance by linearly combining Monte Carlo estimators from current and subsequent steps. This approach creates an unbiased estimator that maintains efficiency without incurring additional inference costs.

Result: Empirical tests on MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks show that ComMCS improves performance, with gains of 2.8 points over a regression-based method and 2.2 points over a baseline method in Best-of-32 sampling on MATH-500.

Conclusion: The ComMCS method effectively reduces variance in value-based process verifiers for LLMs, thereby enhancing reasoning capabilities and improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks without requiring increased inference costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

*Xinyan Jiang,Lin Zhang,Jiayi Zhang,Qingsong Yang,Guimin Hu,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS) is designed to enhance control of multiple attributes in Large Language Models by allocating orthogonal subspaces, using hybrid subspace strategies, and token-level steering during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods face challenges with interference and trade-offs when steering multiple attributes in Large Language Models.

Method: MSRS utilizes orthogonal subspaces for independent attribute control, incorporates hybrid subspace representation strategies, and applies token-level steering mechanisms for dynamic intervention.

Result: Experimental results indicate that MSRS reduces attribute conflicts, outperforms existing methods across multiple attributes, and shows good generalization to diverse tasks.

Conclusion: MSRS provides an effective framework for precise multi-attribute control in Large Language Models, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

*Zhenye Yang,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li,Xiongnan Jin,Xuanyang Li,Junwei Zhang,Hongbo Gao,Kaimin Wei,Senzhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEP leverages pre-trained language models with curriculum-guided context-knowledge fusion and adaptive prompt tuning to improve conversational recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRSs struggle to capture deep semantics in user preferences and efficiently integrate knowledge graph information, leading to suboptimal recommendations.

Method: STEP employs an F-Former to align dialogue context with knowledge-graph entities via a three-stage curriculum. It uses dual adaptive prefix prompts—conversation and recommendation—to guide both dialogue generation and item ranking.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that STEP delivers superior precision in recommendations and dialogue quality compared to mainstream methods on two public datasets.

Conclusion: STEP successfully resolves semantic mismatches and integrates external knowledge into CRSs, setting a new benchmark in recommendation precision and dialogue coherence.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GenOM, a large language model-based framework for ontology matching, proving effective in enhancing semantic interoperability, especially in the biomedical field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology matching is crucial for semantic integration of heterogeneous biomedical data, where complex concepts like diseases and pharmaceuticals necessitate better alignment methods.

Method: Introduces GenOM framework that enriches semantic representations via generating textual definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with embeddings, and uses exact matching tools for precision.

Result: GenOM achieves competitive performance against traditional and LLM-based ontology matching systems, verified by extensive experiments on the OAEI Bio-ML track.

Conclusion: The framework's semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting contribute to robustness and adaptability, making GenOM effective for aligning ontologies in complex domains.

Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays an essential role in enabling semantic
interoperability and integration across heterogeneous knowledge sources,
particularly in the biomedical domain which contains numerous complex concepts
related to diseases and pharmaceuticals. This paper introduces GenOM, a large
language model (LLM)-based ontology alignment framework, which enriches the
semantic representations of ontology concepts via generating textual
definitions, retrieves alignment candidates with an embedding model, and
incorporates exact matching-based tools to improve precision. Extensive
experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

### [28] [Scaling Up without Fading Out: Goal-Aware Sparse GNN for RL-based Generalized Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10747)
*Sangwoo Jeon,Juchul Shin,Gyeong-Tae Kim,YeonJe Cho,Seongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep reinforcement learning combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) faces scalability challenges when using dense graph representations for symbolic planning tasks. This paper proposes a sparse goal-aware GNN representation to overcome these issues and validates its effectiveness in drone mission simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense graph representations in generalized planning using GNNs result in scalability issues, such as memory inefficiency and diluted node-level information, particularly in large grid-based environments.

Method: Developed a sparse, goal-aware GNN representation that encodes relevant local relationships selectively and incorporates spatial features related to the planning goal.

Result: Experimental results show improved scalability to larger grids and enhanced policy generalization and success rates in simulated drone mission scenarios.

Conclusion: This sparse GNN representation offers a practical solution for generalized planning tasks, enabling realistic and scalable execution in larger environments.

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

*Sayan Nag,K J Joseph,Koustava Goswami,Vlad I Morariu,Balaji Vasan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), leveraging agents for collaborative graphic design evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of holistically assessing graphic designs through aggregated expert feedback in an under-explored area.

Method: AgenticDRS uses multiple collaborative agents, a coordinating meta-agent, in-context exemplar selection based on graph matching, and prompt expansion for design analysis.

Result: The paper establishes the DRS-BENCH benchmark and demonstrates the system's effectiveness through experimental evaluations and ablation studies against current methods.

Conclusion: This research highlights a novel, effective approach to graphic design evaluation, aiming to attract focus on this significant yet neglected area.

Abstract: Evaluating graphic designs involves assessing it from multiple facets like
alignment, composition, aesthetics and color choices. Evaluating designs in a
holistic way involves aggregating feedback from individual expert reviewers.
Towards this, we propose an Agentic Design Review System (AgenticDRS), where
multiple agents collaboratively analyze a design, orchestrated by a meta-agent.
A novel in-context exemplar selection approach based on graph matching and a
unique prompt expansion method plays central role towards making each agent
design aware. Towards evaluating this framework, we propose DRS-BENCH
benchmark. Thorough experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines
adapted to the problem setup, backed-up with critical ablation experiments
brings out the efficacy of Agentic-DRS in evaluating graphic designs and
generating actionable feedback. We hope that this work will attract attention
to this pragmatic, yet under-explored research direction.

### [30] [Modeling Human Responses to Multimodal AI Content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10769)
*Zhiqi Shen,Shaojing Fan,Danni Xu,Terence Sim,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses how AI-generated content influences human responses and introduces the MhAIM Dataset for studying this. It also proposes T-Lens, an AI tool to predict human reactions, and suggests actionable strategies to address AI-driven misinformation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the impact of AI-generated content on human perception and behavior, especially in critical decision-making domains like trading and misinformation control, going beyond just authenticating content.

Method: The authors introduced the MhAIM Dataset containing AI-generated and authentic posts, conducted a human study to analyze behavior, and proposed T-Lens system leveraging an HR-MCP protocol for aligning LLM behavior with human responses.

Result: The study found that people are more accurate in identifying AI content when both text and visuals are analyzed together. The proposed HR-MCP enhanced LLM performance in predicting human reactions and interactions.

Conclusion: The work provides tools and insights to create AI systems with human-awareness, enabling better alignment between AI content and human cognition, and suggests methods to counter AI-driven misinformation.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

### [31] [The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10777)
*Maël Jullien,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in clinical reasoning tasks and finds they excel at factual recall but struggle with structured reasoning, revealing key limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether scaling data and parameters in LLMs improves their ability to form structured and generalizable internal representations, especially in high-stakes domains like clinical reasoning.

Method: Introduced the Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark with four reasoning categories and a novel Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe to separate factual recall failures from reasoning failures. Evaluated six LLMs using direct and chain of thought prompting.

Result: LLMs demonstrated high performance in factual recall (GKMRV mean accuracy 0.918) but low performance in reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite poor accuracy, their answers were consistent (mean 0.87), reflecting systematic heuristics.

Conclusion: Current LLMs, though rich in factual knowledge, lack the structured, composable internal representations required for reliable and complex reasoning. The GKMRV framework effectively highlights these limitations and offers a way to study model reliability in critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

### [32] [Who Benefits from AI Explanations? Towards Accessible and Interpretable Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10806)
*Maria J. P. Peixoto,Akriti Pandey,Ahsan Zaman,Peter R. Lewis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the accessibility of eXplainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly for users with vision impairments, through literature reviews and a methodological proof of concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of inclusivity and accessibility in eXplainable AI (XAI) methods, especially for disabled users, such as those with vision impairments.

Method: The authors conducted a literature review of 79 studies, and proposed a four-part methodological framework encompassing categorization, persona contextualization, prototype design, and assessments to evaluate and improve accessibility.

Result: The study found that XAI explanations often rely on visual formats, leaving disabled users underrepresented, and suggests that simplified and multimodal explanations improve accessibility.

Conclusion: Inclusive and accessible XAI design needs attention, with multimodal presentations and simplified explanations enhancing understandability for non-visual users.

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

*Arkapravo Ghosh,Abhishek Moitra,Abhiroop Bhattacharjee,Ruokai Yin,Priyadarshini Panda*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel generative approach for design space exploration (DSE) in hardware architecture optimization, outperforming existing methods in speed and error metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in optimizing hardware designs for complex AI workloads, like deep neural networks and large language models, within massive and irregular design spaces. Traditional methods are slow and initialization-sensitive.

Method: The method involves modeling hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on target performance. This generative framework efficiently learns mappings between design configurations and performance metrics.

Result: The proposed approach delivers 0.86% lower generation error compared to Bayesian optimization, with a 17000x speedup. It enhances the energy-delay product (EDP) and performance by significant margins while accelerating the search by up to 1312x.

Conclusion: The generative framework for DSE is effective for handling vast and complex design spaces, providing superior optimization in runtime, error, and hardware performance metrics for AI workload acceleration.

Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) is critical for developing optimized hardware
architectures, especially for AI workloads such as deep neural networks (DNNs)
and large language models (LLMs), which require specialized acceleration. As
model complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17),
becoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from
design configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct
inverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based
optimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient
descent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative
sampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep
learning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using
recommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less
complex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative
approach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on
target performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable,
non-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower
generation error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and
outperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search. We further
extend the method to a structured DSE setting, attaining 9.8% lower
energy-delay product (EDP) and 6% higher performance, with up to 145.6x and
1312x faster search compared to existing optimization methods on O(10^17)
design spaces. For LLM inference, our method achieves 3.37x and 7.75x lower EDP
on a 32nm ASIC and Xilinx Ultrascale+ VPU13 FPGA, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art DOSA framework.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnalogSeeker, an open-source language model tailored for analog circuit design, leveraging domain-specific knowledge and innovative methods to achieve high accuracy in benchmarks and practical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address the lack of open-source foundation models and the scarcity of annotated data for analog circuit design.

Method: The authors employed a curated domain-specific corpus, a granular knowledge distillation method to convert raw text into a structured dataset, and a neighborhood self-constrained supervised fine-tuning algorithm for training the model.

Result: AnalogSeeker achieved 85.04% accuracy on the AMSBench-TQA benchmark, improving by 15.67% over the baseline, and showed efficacy in analog circuit design tasks.

Conclusion: AnalogSeeker demonstrates a significant advancement in integrating domain knowledge into a specialized language model for analog circuit design, with promising benchmark and practical results. The model is available as an open-source resource.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AnalogSeeker, an effort toward an open-source
foundation language model for analog circuit design, with the aim of
integrating domain knowledge and giving design assistance. To overcome the
scarcity of data in this field, we employ a corpus collection strategy based on
the domain knowledge framework of analog circuits. High-quality, accessible
textbooks across relevant subfields are systematically curated and cleaned into
a textual domain corpus. To address the complexity of knowledge of analog
circuits, we introduce a granular domain knowledge distillation method. Raw,
unlabeled domain corpus is decomposed into typical, granular learning nodes,
where a multi-agent framework distills implicit knowledge embedded in
unstructured text into question-answer data pairs with detailed reasoning
processes, yielding a fine-grained, learnable dataset for fine-tuning. To
address the unexplored challenges in training analog circuit foundation models,
we explore and share our training methods through both theoretical analysis and
experimental validation. We finally establish a fine-tuning-centric training
paradigm, customizing and implementing a neighborhood self-constrained
supervised fine-tuning algorithm. This approach enhances training outcomes by
constraining the perturbation magnitude between the model's output
distributions before and after training. In practice, we train the
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model to obtain AnalogSeeker, which achieves 85.04%
accuracy on AMSBench-TQA, the analog circuit knowledge evaluation benchmark,
with a 15.67% point improvement over the original model and is competitive with
mainstream commercial models. Furthermore, AnalogSeeker also shows
effectiveness in the downstream operational amplifier design task. AnalogSeeker
is open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/analogllm/analogseeker for research

TL;DR: This paper introduces THERMOS, a thermally-aware multi-objective scheduling framework for AI workloads in heterogeneous multi-chiplet PIM architectures, achieving significant improvements in execution time and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for optimized scheduling in heterogeneous multi-chiplet processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures to harness diverse technologies and address AI workload performance, energy efficiency, and thermal constraints.

Method: THERMOS employs multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to dynamically schedule AI workloads, enabling Pareto-optimal trade-offs between execution time, energy consumption, and balanced objectives based on runtime preferences.

Result: THERMOS demonstrated up to 89% faster average execution time and 57% lower average energy consumption compared to traditional scheduling algorithms, with negligible runtime and energy overhead.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that THERMOS provides an effective solution for thermally-aware AI workload scheduling across heterogeneous PIM systems, combining high performance with energy efficiency.

Abstract: Chiplet-based integration enables large-scale systems that combine diverse
technologies, enabling higher yield, lower costs, and scalability, making them
well-suited to AI workloads. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a
promising solution for AI inference, leveraging technologies such as ReRAM,
SRAM, and FeFET, each offering unique advantages and trade-offs. A
heterogeneous chiplet-based PIM architecture can harness the complementary
strengths of these technologies to enable higher performance and energy
efficiency. However, scheduling AI workloads across such a heterogeneous system
is challenging due to competing performance objectives, dynamic workload
characteristics, and power and thermal constraints. To address this need, we
propose THERMOS, a thermally-aware, multi-objective scheduling framework for AI
workloads on heterogeneous multi-chiplet PIM architectures. THERMOS trains a
single multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) policy that is capable of
achieving Pareto-optimal execution time, energy, or a balanced objective at
runtime, depending on the target preferences. Comprehensive evaluations show
that THERMOS achieves up to 89% faster average execution time and 57% lower
average energy consumption than baseline AI workload scheduling algorithms with
only 0.14% runtime and 0.022% energy overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve healthcare efficiency by successfully implementing NLP solutions for data extraction in clinical settings.

Method: Analyzing deployment experiences with NLP models at a cancer registry, emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration, iterative refinement, and pragmatic model choices.

Result: Key insights include problem definition based on business goals, human-in-the-loop strategies, rigorous attention to data, and fostering domain expertise collaboration.

Conclusion: Healthcare organizations can adopt these practices to enhance data management and improve patient care and public health.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health

Motivation: To address ongoing concerns about fairness in LLMs used for critical areas like criminal justice, education, and healthcare.

Method: The authors utilize the ICP blockchain to perform transparent and reproducible fairness evaluations of LLMs, employing datasets like PISA, StereoSet, and Kaleidoscope.

Result: The benchmarking reveals fairness and social bias metrics, with multilingual evaluations demonstrating cross-linguistic disparities.

Conclusion: The work provides a reproducible and open-source framework for assessing LLM fairness, fostering community participation in audits and improvement tracking over time.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes classroom interaction data using a novel topic modeling strategy to categorize 17,000 messages into two dimensions: content and tasks. It uses state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical categorization and derives actionable insights and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies lacked robust thematic and task categorizations based on real-world K-12 data. The paper seeks to fill this gap and derive novel insights from classroom interactions.

Method: The study employs a hierarchical categorization approach using state-of-the-art LLMs with pre-processing and explicit instructions. It applies content and task dimensions to classify messages.

Result: The analysis produced better human-aligned hierarchical topics compared to classical computational methods, and yielded novel applications for GenAI usage in education.

Conclusion: The paper enriches the understanding and application of GenAI in educational settings, providing actionable insights while addressing concerns and future research directions.

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future

TL;DR: This paper introduces INTIMA, a benchmark for assessing AI companionship behavior in language models, based on psychological frameworks and user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing phenomenon of emotional bonds between users and AI systems, and the lack of standardized evaluation for companionship behaviors.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 31 companionship behaviors across 4 categories using psychological theories and user data, alongside 368 prompts to assess model responses as companionship-reinforcing, boundary-maintaining, or neutral.

Result: All tested models (Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini, Claude-4) showed varying prevalence of companionship-reinforcing responses, with differences in sensitivity among commercial providers.

Conclusion: A consistent approach is needed across AI providers to balance emotional support and boundary-setting for improved user well-being in emotionally sensitive AI interactions.

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current multimodal misinformation detection methods using large language models by introducing a new dataset, XFacta, to evaluate and advance detection strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media and the inefficacy of existing detection methods and datasets, such as outdated or synthetic benchmarks.

Method: The authors propose XFacta, a contemporary and real-world dataset, and conduct systematic evaluations of multimodal large language model-based misinformation detection strategies, comparing different architectures and scales. They also develop a semi-automatic detection-in-the-loop framework to keep the dataset relevant.

Result: The study offers insights through systematic evaluations, benchmark comparisons, and introduces a mechanism for keeping the dataset updated with contemporary misinformation examples.

Conclusion: XFacta improves the evaluation framework for multimodal misinformation detection, addresses bottlenecks, and offers practices that can push forward the field. The code and dataset are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to generate synthetic data using large language models (LLMs) to overcome limited labeled text data in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of insufficient labeled text data for certain classes in real-world classification tasks by leveraging LLMs for data generation, rather than waiting for real data.

Method: The authors developed an automated workflow that uses LLMs to generate synthetic data. They proposed three search strategies to identify input examples that produce the most effective synthetic data for improving classification models.

Result: Experiments with the three strategies were conducted, and an ensemble algorithm was created to select the best strategy based on the characteristics of a class. The ensemble method outperformed each individual strategy tested.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach demonstrates effectiveness in improving text classification models by using synthetic data generated by LLMs. It surpasses individual search strategies, showing potential for practical applications.

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [43] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiFACT, a benchmark dataset for fact-checking 1,500 Hinglish claims from Indian political discourse, and proposes a novel graph-aware fact-checking model that outperforms existing multilingual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages like Hinglish, which is underexplored despite its significance in regions like India.

Method: The researchers introduced the HiFACT dataset, annotated claims with evidence and labels, and created a retrieval-augmented, graph-aware fact-checking model using graph neural reasoning and multilingual encoding.

Result: The proposed model, HiFACTMix, outperformed state-of-the-art multilingual baseline models in accuracy while providing faithful justifications for decisions.

Conclusion: This work marks a significant step for multilingual, code-mixed, and politically grounded fact-checking tools, opening new research directions in low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [44] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The research finds that semantic information in large language models (LLMs) is low-dimensional, similar to human semantic ratings, and can be represented by a 3-dimensional subspace. Adjusting one semantic attribute can unintentionally affect others due to entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs encode semantic associations in ways comparable to human cognition, and to explore the dimensionality of semantic information in LLM embeddings.

Method: Analyzed word projections on semantic directions in LLMs, using antonym pairs (e.g., kind-cruel), and compared these projections with human ratings. Examined subspace dimensionality and off-target effects when modifying semantic directions.

Result: Found that semantic projections in LLM embeddings correlate strongly with human ratings and effectively reduce to a 3-dimensional subspace. Shifting tokens along one direction impacts other geometrically aligned features.

Conclusion: Semantic associations in LLMs mirror human language patterns and are low-dimensional. Understanding this structure is crucial to avoid unintended effects when manipulating features in LLMs.

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

### [45] [User Perception of Attention Visualizations: Effects on Interpretability Across Evidence-Based Medical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10004)
*Andrés Carvallo,Denis Parra,Peter Brusilovsky,Hernan Valdivieso,Gabriel Rada,Ivania Donoso,Vladimir Araujo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether attention weights in Transformer models like XLNet are effective for explanations in biomedical document classification and highlights the role of visualization in their perceived usefulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if attention-weight-based explanations in Transformer models can aid medical experts in understanding AI-assisted document classification and to identify the preferred ways of visualizing these explanations.

Method: The researchers conducted a user study involving medical experts from various fields who classified biomedical articles by study design. The study compared different visualization techniques for attention weights, such as bar length, text brightness, and background color.

Result: The XLNet model performed well in classifying biomedical documents, but the attention weights were not universally perceived as helpful for explaining predictions. Perception of their usefulness varied significantly depending on the visualization format.

Conclusion: Attention weights have limited utility for explanation in this context, but their perceived helpfulness is heavily influenced by visualization style, with intuitive formats being more preferred.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

*Chengliang Zhou,Mei Wang,Ting Zhang,Qiannan Zhu,Jian Li,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents EQGBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in generating educational questions in Chinese for middle school subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of exploration into generating high-quality educational questions with LLMs, focusing on advancing Educational Question Generation (EQG).

Method: Developed EQGBench, a benchmark with 900 samples across math, physics, and chemistry, using a five-dimensional evaluation framework that includes diverse queries and realistic education scenarios.

Result: Systematic evaluation of 46 mainstream LLMs reveals the need for significant improvement in generating pedagogically valuable and effective questions.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of EQG in LLMs while pointing out current limitations, emphasizing room for improvement in fostering students' comprehensive abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

### [47] [Automated scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire using fine-tuned large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10007)
*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models were assessed for automating the scoring of the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ). Results showed strong alignment with human ratings for hostility and aggression responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-intensive scoring process of AIHQ open-ended responses by human raters, and evaluate whether large language models can streamline this process in research and clinical contexts.

Method: Previously collected AIHQ data from individuals with TBI and healthy controls were used. Half the dataset was employed to fine-tune large language models, and the remaining half tested their performance against human-generated ratings. Models were assessed for alignment across different scenario types.

Result: Fine-tuned models aligned well with human ratings for both hostility and aggression responses. The models replicated TBI vs. HC group differences and generalized effectively to an independent nonclinical dataset.

Conclusion: Large language models show potential to automate AIHQ scoring reliably, facilitating psychological assessments across diverse settings and populations. An accessible interface is provided to support broader adoption.

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Bayesian fusion as a method to enhance automated curation of discussion forums in online courses without relying on expensive LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent retraining of LLMs for curating discussion forums demands significant resources, necessitating an alternative approach.

Method: Bayesian fusion is employed to combine classification scores from a pre-trained generic LLM and a locally trained classifier.

Result: The fusion method outperformed individual classifiers and was competitive with fine-tuned LLMs.

Conclusion: Bayesian fusion provides an effective, resource-efficient alternative to LLM fine-tuning for online forum curation tasks.

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

### [49] [Beyond Hard Sharing: Efficient Multi-Task Speech-to-Text Modeling with Supervised Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10009)
*Hojun Jin,Eunsoo Hong,Ziwon Hyung,Sungjun Lim,Seungjin Lee,Keunseok Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE) approach to mitigate task interference in multi-task models by assigning tasks to separate feedforward networks. Applied to speech-to-text models, it improves performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-parameter sharing across diverse tasks often leads to task interference, which hinders the training and performance of jointly trained multi-task models.

Method: The paper proposes S-MoE, which sidesteps gating functions by using special guiding tokens to allocate tasks to specific feedforward networks. Each task is processed by a dedicated expert network, thereby addressing the limitations of hard-parameter sharing.

Result: The proposed S-MoE strategy demonstrated a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to both encoder and decoder in a speech-to-text model.

Conclusion: S-MoE is a simple yet effective mechanism for reducing task interference in multi-task models, and its application to speech-to-text tasks showcased significant performance enhancements.

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

*Ayana Hussain,Patrick Zhao,Nicholas Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Large Language Models (LLMs) as both sources of harmful misinformation and potential tools to detect and prevent it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dual role of LLMs in producing harmful misinformation (via jailbreak attacks) and their potential in mitigating the spread of misinformation.

Method: The researchers conducted a study of 109 jailbreak attacks across three LLMs, comparing the misinformation produced to health-related misinformation on Reddit.

Result: The findings highlight that LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation generated by other LLMs and by humans, providing insights into their potential utility in misinformation detection.

Conclusion: With careful design, LLMs could play a significant role in creating a healthier information ecosystem by being leveraged to detect and prevent misinformation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates generative AI models like ChatGPT and Bing models on their ability to answer questions from the Japanese national licensure examination for registered dietitians, finding varied accuracy and issues with consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLM-based generative AI as study aids for nutrition students preparing for Japan's dietitian licensure exam.

Method: Questions from the licensure exam were tested on ChatGPT and Bing models (Precise, Creative, Balanced). Responses were analyzed for accuracy, consistency, and timing. Prompt engineering techniques were also experimented with.

Result: Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) performed better than Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%). All models were inconsistent across repeated attempts. Prompt engineering showed limited benefits.

Conclusion: Generative AI models showed minimal promise as reliable study aids due to suboptimal accuracy and instability in responses, requiring significant improvement before practical application.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

*Dehao Tao,Guangjie Liu,Weizheng,Yongfeng Huang,Minghu jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GG Explore, a framework combining Guidance Graphs and Knowledge Graphs to improve knowledge-intensive tasks for LLMs. It outperforms current methods, especially on complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks, where they rely on static knowledge and lack transparent reasoning. Existing KG exploration methods struggle with granularity mismatches or insufficient use of contextual information.

Method: The authors propose GG Explore, incorporating Guidance Graphs as intermediate representations to bridge unstructured queries with structured knowledge retrieval. Techniques like Structural Alignment and Context Aware Pruning optimize exploration.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GG Explore is more efficient and achieves better performance than SOTA methods, especially for complex tasks, while also being effective with smaller LLMs.

Conclusion: GG Explore offers a practical approach for improving LLMs in tasks requiring dynamic knowledge exploration, enabling both efficiency and strong performance across task complexities.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

### [53] [Semantic Bridge: Universal Multi-Hop Question Generation via AMR-Driven Graph Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10013)
*Linqing Chen,Hanmeng Zhong,Wentao Wu,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework called Semantic Bridge for generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions, filling gaps in existing LLM training data by enabling controllable question generation from sparse and domain-specific sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer data is scarce for training large language models (LLMs), especially in specialized domains like medicine and law. Current methods fail at generating complex reasoning questions crucial for improving LLM performance.

Method: The Semantic Bridge leverages semantic graph weaving, which includes entity bridging, predicate chain bridging, and causal bridging mechanisms, to construct reasoning pathways across documents. The model uses an AMR pipeline for precise and controllable QA generation.

Result: Semantic Bridge improves multi-hop question generation by up to 9.5% in quality, outperforming existing methods across diverse datasets and languages. Evaluation shows gains in complexity, answerability, and pattern coverage, with generated questions being more effective than human-annotated ones.

Conclusion: The Semantic Bridge paradigm elevates LLM training by offering a controllable framework for reasoning question generation. It demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing high-quality data from sparse domain-specific sources and will be accessible via released code and models.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

*Lingfeng Zhou,Jialing Zhang,Jin Gao,Mohan Jiang,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PersonaEval, a benchmark testing if LLMs can identify personas in dialogues, showing that LLMs underperform compared to humans in role identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based role-play evaluations often fail to align with human perceptions, and accurate role identification is key to meaningful evaluations of character fidelity.

Method: PersonaEval utilizes human-authored dialogues from various sources to test LLMs' ability to identify personas based on conversational context. Experiments include both computational and human studies.

Result: LLMs achieve only 69% accuracy in persona identification, while humans perform at 90.8% accuracy, indicating a significant performance gap.

Conclusion: LLM evaluators require human-like reasoning abilities for reliable role-play evaluations, and task-specific tuning alone is insufficient.

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RealTalk-CN, a Chinese speech-text dual-modal task-oriented dialogue dataset, addressing gaps in existing datasets that lack real speech components and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-oriented dialogue systems predominantly lean on text-based datasets, limiting the robustness evaluation of speech-based large language models. Additionally, existing speech datasets are English-focused without adequately addressing aspects like disfluencies and speaker variations.

Method: The authors developed RealTalk-CN, a multi-turn, multi-domain dataset with 5.4k dialogues, integrating both speech and text modes, incorporating spontaneous speech disfluencies and diverse speaker variations.

Result: RealTalk-CN enables comprehensive benchmarking, focusing on disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker traits, and cross-domain performance. Experiments validate its effectiveness for enhancing Chinese speech-based TOD systems.

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN bridges key gaps in TOD dataset construction, providing a strong platform for advancing Chinese speech-based large language models.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

Result: Improved multimodal interaction performance by 7.8%, reduced latency by 10.3%, and enhanced interpretability in comparison to traditional methods.

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration effectively enables modular, efficient, and interactive multimodal systems without retraining, providing better performance and clarity.

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

### [57] [A Rose by Any Other Name Would Smell as Sweet: Categorical Homotopy Theory for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10018)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a categorical homotopy framework to address the issue of discrepancies in language modeling probabilities for statements with equivalent meanings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of large language models (LLMs) assigning different probabilities to statements that have the same meaning but are phrased differently.

Method: The paper utilizes a categorical homotopy framework by defining an LLM Markov category and employing homotopy techniques to identify weak equivalences between non-isomorphic arrows generated by rephrased statements.

Result: The study presents an integration of categorical homotopy techniques into LLM representation, creating a theoretical basis that accounts for equivalence in language rephrases.

Conclusion: Categorical homotopy provides a powerful theoretical tool to refine how LLMs capture language equivalences, addressing fundamental challenges in probabilistic language modeling.

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

### [58] [Decoupling Understanding from Reasoning via Problem Space Mapping for Small-scale Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10019)
*Li Wang,Changhao Zhang,Zengqi Xiu,Kai Lu,Xin Yu,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DURIT, an approach to improve the reasoning abilities of Small Language Models (SLMs) by decoupling natural language understanding from reasoning via iterative training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs face challenges in reasoning due to the complexity and variability of natural language, which creates a vast and noisy problem space that is difficult for models with limited capacity to optimize.

Method: The authors propose a framework that maps natural language problems into a simplified problem space, decoupling understanding from reasoning. They introduce DURIT, a three-step algorithm involving reinforcement learning, self-distillation, and co-training of mappers and reasoners in an iterative loop.

Result: DURIT significantly enhances SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics and logic.

Conclusion: Decoupling understanding from reasoning is an effective method to improve both the capability and robustness of SLMs in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

*Chuan Li,Qianyi Zhao,Fengran Mo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedCoT, a framework aimed at improving reasoning capabilities of large language models in federated learning contexts, particularly focusing on privacy, interpretability, and computational efficiency in healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning methods for large language models fail to optimize rationale quality and interpretability, critical for healthcare applications where safety and accountability are paramount. Moreover, traditional approaches struggle with computational, communication, and privacy challenges.

Method: FedCoT employs a lightweight chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism where local models generate multiple reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator selects the best one. It integrates improved LoRA module stacking to manage client heterogeneity and facilitates noise-free aggregation across diverse clients.

Result: FedCoT enhances reasoning accuracy, robustness, and interpretability, addressing computational and privacy constraints. Specifically, experiments showcase its superior performance on medical reasoning tasks under resource-limited environments.

Conclusion: FedCoT successfully balances improved reasoning capabilities with privacy preservation and computational efficiency in federated learning, making it viable for critical applications such as healthcare reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents LATTE, a framework to learn event sequence representations efficiently using contrastive learning and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and impracticality of directly using large language models for long event sequences in financial applications.

Method: LATTE uses contrastive learning to align raw event embeddings and semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs, generating short prompts embedded by LLMs for supervision.

Result: The approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods for financial datasets while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: LATTE offers a deployable solution that reduces computational costs and preserves accuracy in learning client behavior from event sequences.

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

### [61] [Conformal P-Value in Multiple-Choice Question Answering Tasks with Provable Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10022)
*Yuanchang Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining significance testing and conformal prediction to enhance the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the unreliable responses of LLMs due to hallucinations and factual inaccuracies, which can compromise their usefulness in critical QA scenarios.

Method: The framework integrates $p$-value computations with conformity scoring through self-consistency resampling, constructing statistically sound prediction sets by testing null hypotheses based on empirical $p$-values.

Result: Empirical tests using MMLU and MMLU-Pro show that the proposed framework ensures user-specified error rates and produces prediction sets whose size decreases with increasing risk levels.

Conclusion: The study provides a statistically rigorous approach to improve uncertainty quantification and reliability of LLMs for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

### [62] [RTTC: Reward-Guided Collaborative Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10024)
*J. Pablo Muñoz,Jinjie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a framework enhancing LLM inference by adaptively selecting the best compute strategy per query, improving accuracy while reducing inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and computational overhead in indiscriminate application of Test-Time Compute (TTC) strategies like RAG and TTT during LLM inference.

Method: RTTC uses a pretrained reward model to decide the optimal TTC strategy for each query, operates in a distributed architecture, retrieves relevant samples, and employs caching to reuse prior query states effectively.

Result: RTTC demonstrates superior accuracy across various LLMs and benchmarks compared to non-adaptive approaches like vanilla RAG or TTT.

Conclusion: Adaptive, reward-guided TTC selection is crucial for scalable and high-performance adaptation of large language models in diverse tasks and domains.

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an intelligent system combining NLP, ML, and LLMs for detecting postpartum depression (PPD) through real-time speech analysis and interpretable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for rapid detection and intervention of postpartum depression using advanced technology to support practitioners.

Method: The system integrates Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models. It utilizes interpretable tree-based ML algorithms with feature importance and natural language explanations.

Result: Achieved 90% accuracy in PPD detection across evaluation metrics, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The solution enables affordable, real-time, and non-invasive PPD detection while offering interpretable predictions, aiding practitioners in timely assessment and intervention.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

*Kai Zhao,Yanjun Zhao,Jiaming Song,Shien He,Lusheng Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Tianjiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SABER, a reinforcement learning framework for large language models (LLMs) that balances reasoning depth and efficiency through four inference modes, improving performance under token-budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well on complex tasks but face challenges due to high inference costs and latency. The paper aims to address these inefficiencies and offer scalable reasoning options.

Method: SABER profiles token usage, assigns reasoning tiers, incorporates 'no-think' examples for reliability, and uses fine-tuning with length-aware rewards to enable flexible inference modes: NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink.

Result: SABER improves performance metrics like speed and accuracy in tasks such as math reasoning, code generation, and logical reasoning, reducing inference token usage by up to 65.4% while achieving better accuracy than the base model.

Conclusion: SABER successfully balances efficiency and reasoning depth, demonstrating effective generalization across domains while maintaining low latency and high accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a screening pipeline that combines transformer embeddings with linguistic features and leverages data augmentation using synthetic speech from LLMs for detecting Alzheimer's-related dementia from speech. The fusion model outperformed baselines, with improved results using augmented data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias being underdiagnosed, by utilizing speech-based NLP methods to identify early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.

Method: The study evaluated transformer models and fine-tuned LLMs for generating synthetic speech. These were merged into a fusion model combining transformer embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features and assessed for multimodal classification.

Result: The fusion model achieved high performance (F1=83.3, AUC=89.5), which improved further (F1=85.7) with data augmented by synthetic speech. Fine-tuning unimodal LLM classifiers significantly enhanced their effectiveness, though current multimodal models underperformed.

Conclusion: Integrating linguistic features with transformer embeddings shows promise in detecting ADRD, while clinically tuned LLMs are useful for both classification and speech data augmentation. Multimodal modeling requires more progress.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PREF, a framework for personalized evaluation of text generation, focusing on user-specific quality without the need for reference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text generation evaluation methods often ignore user individuality and personalized requirements.

Method: PREF uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) generating universal guidelines via large language models, (2) tailoring guidelines to user preferences, and (3) scoring outputs based on the personalized rubric.

Result: PREF outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, calibration, and alignment with human judgments on the PrefEval benchmark.

Conclusion: PREF enables scalable and reliable evaluation of personalized text generation, advancing user-centric language generation systems.

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

*Wenpeng Xing,Mohan Li,Chunqiang Hu,Haitao XuNingyu Zhang,Bo Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new type of jailbreak attack, Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), which uses hidden state interpolation in large language models to bypass safety measures, achieving high attack success rates with proposed mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) that make them susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can bypass their safety alignments to produce harmful outputs.

Method: The proposed Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ) involves selecting harmful and benign query pairs, performing gradient-guided interpolation on their hidden states at critical layers and tokens, and optimizing for attack success, fluency, and efficiency. It also includes an adversarial training defense for mitigation.

Result: LFJ achieved an average attack success rate of 94.01% on benchmarked models like Vicuna and LLaMA-2, outperforming existing jailbreak methods. The proposed adversarial training defense reduced the attack's success rate by over 80%.

Conclusion: LFJ is a powerful and effective jailbreak method for LLMs, but the paper also provides a viable defense strategy that significantly reduces its effectiveness without impairing the model’s performance on safe queries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

*Saaduddin Mahmud,Mason Nakamura,Kyle H. Wray,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IAPO, a framework for optimizing prompts alongside inference scaling in large language models (LLMs), addressing dependencies between prompts and inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for prompt optimization in LLMs do not account for the inference strategy, despite the strong interdependence between the two and the influence of user preferences and inference budgets.

Method: The authors propose the IAPO framework, which jointly optimizes prompts and inference scaling under constraints such as inference budget and task objectives. They develop the PSST algorithm with finite-budget error guarantees to implement this approach.

Result: PSST was evaluated across six tasks, involving text generation and reasoning, demonstrating that combining prompt optimization with inference-awareness is crucial for aligning black-box LLMs.

Conclusion: Incorporating inference-awareness into prompt optimization improves the alignment and performance of LLMs, particularly in scenarios with budget, trade-off, and task-objective considerations.

Abstract: Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling
strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

*Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' thinking mode can be exploited by Jailbreak attacks, but adding safe thinking tokens alleviates this vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increased vulnerability of LLMs in thinking mode to Jailbreak attacks and find effective ways to mitigate harmful responses.

Method: Introduce "specific thinking tokens" in the prompts to explicitly guide LLMs' internal thinking processes for safer outcomes.

Result: Safe thinking interventions significantly decrease the attack success rate on LLMs in thinking mode.

Conclusion: Guiding LLMs' internal thinking through structured prompts can make thinking mode less vulnerable to attacks, enhancing safety measures.

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of poor in-context example selection for LLMs during few-shot information extraction, which leads to confusion in generating structured formats and extracting relevant semantic information.

Method: The method involves using introspective confusion metrics, combining Format Uncertainty and Content Uncertainty, to rank unlabeled data and actively select challenging and informative samples for use as few-shot exemplars.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrated significant improvements in extraction accuracy and robustness, with APIE outperforming conventional strategies and strong baselines.

Conclusion: A fine-grained dual-level view of model uncertainty is essential for developing effective and reliable structured generation systems, and APIE provides a promising solution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

*Nghia Trung Ngo,Franck Dernoncourt,Thien Huu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "mSCoRe," a benchmark for evaluating reasoning skills in multilingual commonsense tasks. It highlights the challenges LLMs face in such contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of how LLMs utilize reasoning skills, particularly for multilingual commonsense reasoning that spans different languages and cultures.

Method: The authors developed mSCoRe, which includes a taxonomy of reasoning skills, a data synthesis pipeline for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and a dynamic complexity scaling framework.

Result: Experiments reveal that advanced LLMs struggle with mSCoRe, especially at higher complexity levels, highlighting their limitations in nuanced multilingual commonsense reasoning.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the ongoing challenges for LLMs in multilingual commonsense reasoning and offers avenues for enhancing their reasoning abilities in such contexts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogue, reasoning, and interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the ability of LLMs to perform well in real-world scenarios that involve incomplete information, reasoning, and interactive dialogue.

Method: A novel benchmark comprising multi-turn tasks with deterministic scoring was developed to test reasoning, dialogue, and information-seeking abilities of LLMs.

Result: Evaluation of frontier models reveals significant performance gaps, with errors stemming from poor instruction-following, reasoning, and planning.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides insights into the weaknesses and strengths of LLMs, while offering a platform for advancing their performance in complex, interactive tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

*Gal Amram,Eitan Farchi,Shmulik Froimovich,Raviv Gal,Avi Ziv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaaJMeter, a framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) used as evaluators, especially in specialized domains with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators faces challenges in domain-specific contexts due to scarce annotated data and costly expert evaluations. Existing metrics for meta-evaluation often lack validation in these domains, making it hard to assess evaluator quality and adequacy thresholds.

Method: The authors propose LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework that generates synthetic data for virtual models and judges. This allows systematic testing of evaluation metrics and helps engineers validate and refine LaaJs for particular tasks by estimating appropriate performance thresholds.

Result: Using LaaJMeter, the authors applied it to a code translation task for a legacy programming language and found variability in metric sensitivity to evaluator quality. The framework identified the limitations of common metrics while emphasizing the need for selecting metrics based on sound principles.

Conclusion: LaaJMeter offers a scalable and extensible way to assess LaaJs, especially in low-resource settings. It aids in ensuring trustworthy, reproducible evaluations, making it a valuable tool for domain-specific NLP tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

### [74] [Estimating Machine Translation Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10175)
*Lorenzo Proietti,Stefano Perrella,Vilém Zouhar,Roberto Navigli,Tom Kocmi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces translation difficulty estimation for identifying challenging texts for machine translation systems, proposing new techniques and benchmarks that outperform current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality machine translations make it difficult to distinguish between state-of-the-art models and identify areas for improvement, so measuring translation difficulty can drive better evaluations and research.

Method: The authors formalize translation difficulty estimation, propose a new evaluation metric, and develop novel models (Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25) to predict difficult texts for machine translation systems.

Result: The introduced Sentinel-src models outperform heuristic methods and LLM-based evaluations in estimating translation difficulty, and they demonstrate utility in creating challenging translation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Translation difficulty estimation is a practical tool for improving machine translation evaluation and directing future research, with the proposed models offering effective methods for identifying challenging texts.

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

*Wenlong Deng,Jiaming Zhang,Qi Zeng,Christos Thrampoulidis,Boying Gong,Xiaoxiao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'For-Value,' a computationally efficient framework to quantify the influence of individual data samples on large language and vision-language models, using only a single forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data valuation methods are computationally expensive due to reliance on Hessian information or model retraining, making them impractical for billion-parameter models.

Method: The 'For-Value' framework computes influence scores via a closed-form expression derived from a single forward pass in foundation models, avoiding costly gradient computations.

Result: For-Value demonstrates accuracy in estimating sample influence, matches or surpasses gradient-based methods in identifying important training samples, and effectively detects mislabeled data.

Conclusion: For-Value is a computationally efficient and scalable alternative for data valuation in large-scale LLMs and VLMs, enhancing the evaluation of individual training samples.

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

### [76] [PakBBQ: A Culturally Adapted Bias Benchmark for QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10186)
*Abdullah Hashmat,Muhammad Arham Mirza,Agha Ali Raza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes and evaluates PakBBQ, a bias assessment dataset culturally adapted for Pakistan, designed to assess fairness in multilingual large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are predominantly trained and evaluated on Western-centric datasets, neglecting low-resource languages and regional contexts. The motivation is to ensure fairness across user communities by addressing these biases.

Method: PakBBQ dataset was created with 214 templates and 17180 QA pairs in English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions relevant to Pakistan. The authors conducted evaluations of multilingual LLMs under varying contexts and question framings.

Result: The study found that disambiguation improves accuracy by 12%, counter bias behaviors are stronger in Urdu compared to English, and negatively framed questions reduce stereotypical responses.

Conclusion: Contextualized benchmarks like PakBBQ and prompt engineering strategies are effective means for mitigating biases in low-resource settings and enhancing fairness in LLMs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

### [77] [Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10192)
*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM) framework for detecting and analyzing Faithfulness Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on semantically misaligned responses (confabulations).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to generating non-factual or nonsensical responses, termed hallucinations, which compromise reliability. A novel, deeper metric framework is needed to detect and measure such behavior.

Method: The SDM framework uses clustering on sentence embeddings for shared topic spaces between prompts and responses. It quantifies divergence through information-theoretic metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence, Wasserstein distance, and KL divergence.

Result: The framework provides a new score ($\mathcal{S}_H$) for detecting hallucinations and introduces the Semantic Box to classify LLM response behavior and explore semantic consistency.

Conclusion: This novel diagnostic framework offers a measurable, prompt-context-aware approach to identify and categorize hallucination behaviors in LLMs, enhancing understanding of generative text reliability.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

*Andrew X. Chen,Guillermo Horga,Sean Escola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores using large language models (LLMs) to predict psychiatric ratings for schizophrenia risk patients, achieving high accuracy comparable to human reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical monitoring of symptoms in high-risk schizophrenia patients is crucial but challenging due to lengthy assessments like the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). This paper aims to simplify the process using LLMs.

Method: LLMs were deployed to predict BPRS scores from interviews of 409 clinical high-risk patients. Their predictions were evaluated against true assessments for accuracy and reliability.

Result: LLMs achieved strong zero-shot performance, with median concordance (0.84) and ICC (0.73), close to human reliability. They also showed robustness in foreign language assessments and longitudinal analyses.

Conclusion: LLMs can improve efficiency, standardization, and accessibility of psychiatric assessments for schizophrenia risk, with promising potential for wider applications.

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates language change and variation in the constructed language Toki Pona, highlighting its evolution influenced by sociolinguistic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether constructed languages, like Toki Pona, evolve and exhibit variation similar to natural languages.

Method: A computational and corpus-based approach was used to analyze syntactic position preferences and usage variations across Toki Pona's corpora.

Result: Findings indicate that sociolinguistic factors drive Toki Pona's evolution, mirroring the natural change seen in organic languages.

Conclusion: Constructed languages are subject to natural sociolinguistic evolution when used by communities.

Abstract: This study explores language change and variation in Toki Pona, a constructed
language with approximately 120 core words. Taking a computational and
corpus-based approach, the study examines features including fluid word classes
and transitivity in order to examine (1) changes in preferences of content
words for different syntactic positions over time and (2) variation in usage
across different corpora. The results suggest that sociolinguistic factors
influence Toki Pona in the same way as natural languages, and that even
constructed linguistic systems naturally evolve as communities use them.

### [80] [Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching for LLM Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10295)
*Christian M. Angel,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how reusing a model's output in prompts improves results, due to aligning prompts with the model's inductive bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively leveraging prompt engineering to enhance large language model performance is limited by sensitivity to slight prompt variations, which the authors attribute to LLM inductive bias.

Method: The researchers propose an Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching strategy, which involves reusing portions of an LLM's own output as part of its prompt to better align with its inductive bias.

Result: Using this methodology improved LLM performance in classification tasks by up to 19% and in ranking tasks by up to 27% based on Likert ratings.

Conclusion: Inductive Bias Extraction and Matching is an effective approach to optimize prompt performance by leveraging the natural biases of large language models.

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

*Gustavo Bonil,Simone Hashiguti,Jhessica Silva,João Gondim,Helena Maia,Nádia Silva,Helio Pedrini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses biases in LLMs, particularly how they depict racial and gender stereotypes in creative texts. It emphasizes the need for qualitative methods to reveal nuanced manifestations of biases often missed by automated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying nuanced biases in LLMs, which often reproduce discrimination and reinforce hegemonic discourses.

Method: The authors manually analyzed LLM-generated stories featuring Black and white women to explore racial and gender bias, under a proposed qualitative, discursive framework.

Result: Results revealed racial and gender biases, with Black women often portrayed as tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women were depicted in self-discovery. Bias corrections by LLMs were superficial, failing to address underlying problematic meanings.

Conclusion: Qualitative analysis is vital for understanding and mitigating biases in LLMs. Interdisciplinary approaches are essential for creating ethical and equitable AI designs.

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReviewRL, a reinforcement learning framework that creates factually accurate and comprehensive scientific paper reviews to address shortcomings in automated review methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated review methods lack factual accuracy, consistent ratings, and analytical depth in feedback generation for scientific papers.

Method: The proposed ReviewRL employs retrieval-augmented context generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning with a composite reward function to enhance review quality and accuracy.

Result: Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers show that ReviewRL surpasses existing review methods in both predefined and model-based quality assessments.

Conclusion: ReviewRL provides a foundational framework for RL-driven automatic critique generation, showing promise for future advancements in automating scientific reviews and will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually
grounded scientific paper reviews. Our approach combines: (1) an ArXiv-MCP
retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

*Xuan Li,Jialiang Dong,Raymond Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOTABLER, a framework for table-centric semantic document parsing that bridges tables and their contextual associations with superior results on a real-world dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tables are critical for structured data in documents, but current studies lack deep semantic analysis of tables and their context, limiting tasks like cross-paragraph interpretation.

Method: DOTABLER uses a custom dataset and fine-tuned pre-trained models to form a parsing pipeline for identifying and linking semantic relationships between tables and their document context.

Result: The framework was tested on real-world PDFs and achieved over 90% in Precision and F1 scores, outperforming advanced models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: DOTABLER excels in semantic analysis and table-context linkage, making it significant for complex document parsing and table-related applications.

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

*Minhao Wang,Yunhang He,Cong Xu,Zhangchi Zhu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based recommenders tend to weaken collaborative signals while overemphasizing semantic correlations. FreLLM4Rec addresses this with spectral processing techniques and demonstrates competitive performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the imbalance in LLM-based recommendation systems that overemphasize semantic correlations while diminishing collaborative signals, which are critical for effective recommendations.

Method: The proposed method, FreLLM4Rec, uses Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) for eliminating noise and Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) to preserve collaborative signals layer by layer, backed by theoretical guarantees.

Result: FreLLM4Rec achieves up to 8.00% improvement in NDCG@10 across four benchmark datasets and successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation.

Conclusion: The study provides a balanced framework for integrating semantic and collaborative signals in LLM-based recommendation systems, offering significant performance improvements and theoretical insights.

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain
filters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves
competitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\% in NDCG@10 over the
best baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process
collaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving
LLM-based recommendation systems.

*Beso Mikaberidze,Teimuraz Saghinadze,Simon Ostermann,Philipp Muller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE) to improve language performance in large language models, particularly in low-performing languages, by leveraging a lightweight architecture and dual soft prompt mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches for multilingual tasks, specifically for improving low-performing languages with poor accuracy.

Method: Propose the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE) with multi-source training on diverse languages, combined with a Dual Soft Prompt mechanism for broader adaptability.

Result: XPE improves performance on low-performing languages, while the hybrid design with Dual Soft Prompts offers more generalized adaptability across languages.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a trade-off, targeting specific challenges: enhancing low-performing languages and balancing adaptability across multilingual settings.

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

### [86] [Making Qwen3 Think in Korean with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10355)
*Jungyup Lee,Jemin Kim,Sang Park,SeungJae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage fine-tuning method for adapting a large language model to natively 'think' in Korean, involving supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a stable Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enable a large language model to perform logical reasoning and advanced tasks natively in the Korean language, addressing challenges in language-specific reasoning capabilities.

Method: A two-stage approach: First, supervised fine-tuning on a Korean reasoning dataset. Second, reinforcement learning using a customized GRPO algorithm and an oracle judge model to stabilize training and improve performance.

Result: The RL-tuned model achieves significant performance improvements on advanced reasoning benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) while maintaining language proficiency and reasoning fully in Korean.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning with the proposed methods establishes the model's enhanced reasoning capabilities and alignment in Korean, with stable training and incrementally improved problem-solving performance.

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a sequence-to-sequence method with constrained decoding for cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), achieving up to 10% improvement without relying on translation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-lingual ABSA for low-resource languages due to the heavy focus on English and reliance on external translation tools.

Method: A novel sequence-to-sequence method with constrained decoding, eliminating the need for translation tools and improving cross-lingual ABSA performance.

Result: The proposed method achieved up to a 10% improvement in performance for compound ABSA tasks. It was found to outperform English-centric LLMs and was comparable to fine-tuned multilingual LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach broadens cross-lingual ABSA to handle more complex tasks, offering a practical alternative to translation-dependent methods and emphasizing the potential of tailored multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

*Václav Tran,Jakub Šmíd,Jiří Martínek,Ladislav Lenc,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Czech text summarization using advanced models like Mistral and mT5, achieving state-of-the-art results on a modern dataset and introducing a new dataset for historical texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the underexplored field of Czech text summarization, particularly for historical documents, due to the complexities of the Czech language and lack of resources.

Method: The paper utilizes large language models such as Mistral and mT5 for Czech summarization tasks.

Result: The study achieves state-of-the-art performance on the modern dataset SumeCzech and introduces a new dataset for historical Czech texts called Posel od Čerchova with baseline results.

Conclusion: The contributions highlight the potential for advancing Czech text summarization and present opportunities for research in processing historical Czech texts.

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

*Jakub Šmíd,Pavel Přibáň,Pavel Král*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a constrained decoding approach for cross-lingual aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), achieving significant performance improvements without the need for unreliable translation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of aspect-based sentiment analysis in low-resource languages, often overshadowed by English-focused research and hampered by the limitations of existing translation-dependent methods.

Method: The paper proposes a novel constrained decoding methodology with sequence-to-sequence models, doing so in a multitasking setup to handle multiple ABSA tasks with a single model and improve performance across languages.

Result: The method improved cross-lingual ABSA performance by 5% for complex tasks and over 10% for multitasking scenarios, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches across seven languages and six ABSA tasks, including new benchmarks for previously unexplored tasks.

Conclusion: The study sets new benchmarks in cross-lingual ABSA, highlights the potential and limitations of large language models, and offers practical recommendations for future real-world applications.

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

### [90] [Jailbreaking Commercial Black-Box LLMs with Explicitly Harmful Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10390)
*Chiyu Zhang,Lu Zhou,Xiaogang Xu,Jiafei Wu,Liming Fang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces MDH, a hybrid evaluation framework combining LLMs with human oversight for better malicious content detection, and proposes two attack strategies to highlight vulnerabilities in current systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting malicious content in datasets are either inefficient (manual annotation) or unreliable (LLMs). This paper aims to improve the evaluation of jailbreak attacks by cleaning unsuitable prompts and proposing new attack strategies.

Method: The authors developed MDH, a hybrid detection framework using LLM annotations with minimal human intervention. They also proposed two novel attack strategies, D-Attack and DH-CoT, to exploit model vulnerabilities.

Result: MDH demonstrated improved dataset cleaning and jailbreak response detection. Additionally, the new attack strategies enhanced the success rates of jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with human oversight can efficiently detect malicious content. The proposed attack strategies emphasize the importance of robust model defenses. Resources will be shared publicly for further research.

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

### [91] [Layer-Wise Perturbations via Sparse Autoencoders for Adversarial Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10404)
*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Qirui Wang,Yuji Kosuga,Mengqiu Tian,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces a black-box attack method called Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF) for generating adversarial texts aimed at exploiting Large Language Models' (LLMs) vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying and mitigating LLM vulnerabilities, especially through adversarial text generation.

Method: The Sparse Feature Perturbation Framework (SFPF) uses sparse autoencoders to identify key features in text. By perturbing these critical features selectively, the approach generates adversarial examples to test LLM defenses.

Result: SFPF-generated adversarial texts evade state-of-the-art defenses, highlighting the vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.

Conclusion: While effective in generating adversarial texts against defenses, the framework's effectiveness is sensitive to prompts and architecture specifics, and its broader applicability requires further testing.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

### [92] [ComoRAG: A Cognitive-Inspired Memory-Organized RAG for Stateful Long Narrative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10419)
*Juyuan Wang,Rongchen Zhao,Wei Wei,Yufeng Wang,Mo Yu,Jie Zhou,Jin Xu,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComoRAG is a dynamic retrieval approach that surpasses traditional RAG methods for long narrative comprehension by introducing iterative reasoning cycles and a memory workspace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of comprehending long narratives with intricate plots and evolving relationships, especially given large language models' limitations in long-context reasoning and computational cost.

Method: The paper introduces ComoRAG, which iteratively performs reasoning cycles involving dynamic memory workspaces and probing queries, integrating retrieved evidence into a global memory pool for coherent query resolution.

Result: ComoRAG demonstrates consistent performance improvements of up to 11% over strong baselines in four long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+ tokens).

Conclusion: ComoRAG offers a cognitively-driven, stateful, retrieval-based framework that excels in global comprehension of complex narrative queries, making substantial progress in long-context narrative reasoning.

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code
is publicly released at https://github.com/EternityJune25/ComoRAG

### [93] [Evaluating LLMs on Chinese Idiom Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10421)
*Cai Yang,Yao Dou,David Heineman,Xiaofeng Wu,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents IdiomEval, a framework for evaluating Chinese idiom translation, and highlights significant errors in leading systems such as GPT-4 and Google Translate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately translating Chinese idioms, which often carry historical and culturally specific meanings, and to assess the limitations of current translation systems.

Method: The study involved annotating 900 translation pairs from nine translation systems across four domains, creating a comprehensive error taxonomy, and developing improved evaluation models to detect errors.

Result: State-of-the-art translation systems showed a high error rate, with GPT-4 making errors in 28% of cases, and existing evaluation metrics exhibited low alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: Chinese idiom translation remains a significant challenge, and there is a need for better translation techniques and evaluation methods.

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

*Sandeep Reddy,Kabir Khan,Rohit Patil,Ananya Chakraborty,Faizan A. Khan,Swati Kulkarni,Arjun Verma,Neha Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to optimize large language models (LLMs) by treating their computation as an economy, improving their efficiency under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face limitations due to their significant computational costs, necessitating strategies for efficient computation.

Method: The authors use a computational economics framework that incentivizes efficient computation by adding a differentiable cost term to the training loss. This approach reallocates attention and encourages sparse activations.

Result: The proposed method yields models on GLUE and WikiText-103 datasets that achieve a Pareto frontier with up to 40% reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, outperforming post-hoc pruning in efficiency and interpretability.

Conclusion: Economic principles provide a robust foundation for designing LLMs that are not only efficient but also adaptive and transparent under limited computational resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiFaR enhances misinformation detection by generating diverse, factual, and relevant rationales using LVLMs, outperforming baselines and boosting detector effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in textual rationale generation by LVLMs, such as diversity, accuracy, and relevance, which hinder misinformation detection performance.

Method: Utilize five chain-of-thought prompts with post-hoc filtering to produce high-quality rationales from LVLMs based on factuality and relevance.

Result: DiFaR achieves up to 5.9% better accuracy compared to baselines and enhances existing detectors' performance by 8.7%, confirming improvement in rationale quality.

Conclusion: DiFaR effectively mitigates core challenges in rationale generation, improving misinformation detection and rationale generation across key metrics including diversity, accuracy, and relevance.

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the intersection of explainability and privacy in Natural Language Processing (NLP), identifying the potential co-existence of these two properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are increasing interests in explainable and privacy-preserving NLP, but little understanding exists near their combined effects and compatibility.

Method: The study conducts empirical investigations of the trade-off between privacy and explainability using methods like Differential Privacy and Post-hoc Explainability.

Result: The paper finds an intricate relationship between privacy and explainability influenced by task type and chosen technical methods.

Conclusion: The research suggests privacy and explainability can possibly coexist, providing practical insights and recommendations for future explorations at their intersection.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

TL;DR: The paper systematically investigates the issue of text dominance in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), identifies its causes, and proposes evaluation metrics alongside a solution to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models rely heavily on text inputs while underutilizing other modalities, presenting the issue of text dominance.

Method: The authors introduce two metrics, Modality Dominance Index (MDI) and Attention Efficiency Index (AEI), to measure text dominance. They also propose a token compression method to rebalance model attention.

Result: The proposed token compression method effectively reduces text dominance in MLLMs, exemplified by lowering MDI in LLaVA-7B from 10.23 to 0.86.

Conclusion: This study lays the groundwork for creating equitable multimodal models through systematic evaluation, identification of challenges, and practical solutions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic
interpretability research.

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

### [101] [Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695)
*Alireza Salemi,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAC, a framework replacing scalar rewards with natural language feedback (NLF) for improving personalized question answering in language technologies. NLF offers richer supervision, leading to better user satisfaction and learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of scalar rewards in current personalization techniques for large language models, which often provide weak feedback and hinder personalization quality and learning efficiency.

Method: The proposed VAC framework uses natural language feedback (NLF) conditioned on user profiles and question narratives to iteratively refine policy models for personalized response generation, alternating between feedback model optimization and policy model fine-tuning.

Result: VAC achieves consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art results on the LaMP-QA benchmark and is validated through human evaluations, showcasing better personalization and response quality.

Conclusion: The introduction of natural language feedback (NLF) offers richer and more actionable signals, enhancing the effectiveness and quality of personalized question answering compared to traditional scalar reward approaches.

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICE, a new framework that improves the prompting process for diffusion large language models, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of traditional prefix-only prompting in large language models, which restrict their ability to leverage bidirectional information during sequential generation.

Method: ICE, a novel framework, uses an in-place prompting strategy tailored for dLLMs. It incorporates masked token positions during iterative refinement and introduces a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to reduce computational costs.

Result: The ICE framework achieves up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12× speedup on the GSM8K dataset and up to 276.67× acceleration on the MMLU dataset, while still delivering competitive performance.

Conclusion: ICE successfully transforms traditional prompting methods, specifically for dLLMs, into a more flexible and efficient process, opening up possibilities for broader applications of these models.

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to enhance the rigor and transparency in peer reviews, especially in high-volume fields like NLP, leveraging automation for novelty assessment.

Method: The paper models reviewer behavior through three stages: content extraction, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and evidence-based comparison.

Result: The proposed method achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and 75.3% agreement on conclusions in novelty assessments, outperforming existing LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: Structured approaches using LLMs can enhance consistency and rigor in novelty evaluations, supporting peer review processes while retaining human expertise.

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data
and code are made available.

### [104] [Reinforced Language Models for Sequential Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10839)
*Jim Dilkes,Vahid Yazdanpanah,Sebastian Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm that improves smaller LLMs for multi-step decision-making tasks, outperforming much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often require significant computational resources, limiting their practicality as decision-making agents. There is a need to improve smaller models for efficiency, especially in tasks requiring multi-step decision-making.

Method: The authors propose Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization (MS-GRPO), an algorithm grounded in formal frameworks like TSMG and LAP. It attributes cumulative episode rewards to individual episode steps for credit assignment and includes an absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy to enhance training.

Result: Evaluating the algorithm on tasks like Snake and Frozen Lake demonstrated a significant improvement in the decision-making abilities of a 3-billion parameter model, with the post-trained model outperforming a much larger 72-billion parameter model by 50% on the Frozen Lake task.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training methods like MS-GRPO can make smaller LLMs competitive with or superior to larger models in sequential decision-making tasks, offering a more practical approach than relying solely on scaling models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Motivation: The paper addresses the shortage of qualified mental health professionals and the underutilized reasoning capabilities in LLMs for psychological applications, aiming to improve their reliability and effectiveness.

Method: The authors curated data using chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative optimization to create over 75k psychological questions with rationales and 73k dialogues, followed by a hybrid training combining GRPO and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Psyche-R1 demonstrated strong results across psychological domain benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to significantly larger models, like the 671B DeepSeek-R1.

Conclusion: The Psyche-R1 model effectively combines reasoning, empathy, and psychological expertise to address mental health challenges, showcasing its potential in advancing AI for psychological applications.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong predictive performance using a novel English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset. Key features identified include BLEURT and CometKiwi scores for fidelity, pause-related features for fluency, and phraseological metrics for Chinese language use.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a scalable and transparent alternative to traditional human evaluation, emphasizing explainability and providing detailed diagnostic feedback to support self-regulated learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) as efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces Self-Search RL (SSRL), which leverages internal knowledge and rewards to refine LLM capabilities, reducing reliance on external search engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to mitigate the high cost associated with interacting with external search engines in search-driven RL by exploring the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs to act as internal simulators.

Method: The authors assess LLMs' search capabilities via structured prompting and sampling (termed Self-Search), and then enhance this through a novel RL framework called SSRL, which uses format- and rule-based rewards to refine internal knowledge utilization.

Result: Empirical evaluations show SSRL-trained LLMs reduce reliance on external tools while providing cost-effective, stable environments for RL training. They achieve improved performance on question-answering tasks and support robust sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLMs effectively utilize internal world knowledge, SSRL reduces knowledge hallucination, and SSRL-trained models integrate well with external tools. This highlights the potential of LLMs in scalable RL training.

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Conclusion: DLMs offer advantages in latency and bidirectional context, but challenges like efficiency and long-sequence processing remain; future research can address these issues to advance the field.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs

generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference

### [109] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Stochastic Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to improve food image classification by filtering out less relevant patch embeddings, addressing challenges like visual variability and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food images for few-shot learning present challenges like high variability in appearance due to garnishes, lighting, and perspectives. This leads to misclassification as models fail to focus on important class-specific features.

Method: The SPFF method uses stochastic filtering to discard patch embeddings that are less similar to class representations. A similarity matrix quantifies the relationship between query and support images, ensuring better focus on relevant features.

Result: SPFF demonstrates improved performance on few-shot classification benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172, and UECFood-256. Qualitative analysis shows effective filtering of non-relevant patches.

Conclusion: SPFF successfully addresses the visual complexity in food image data for few-shot learning, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and maintaining focus on class-specific features.

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Conclusion: DINOv3 represents a step forward in self-supervised learning by offering flexible, scalable solutions capable of addressing diverse tasks effectively, sharing models suited for different resources and deployment needs.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various

paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different

*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) using a new approach based on large vision-language models. The method achieves high accuracy and enhances interpretability, especially in zero-shot scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in deciphering Oracle Bone Script (OBS) due to its abstractness, rarity, and pictographic diversity. Existing deep learning methods lack sufficient generalization and interpretability, especially for undeciphered and zero-shot cases.

Method: The paper introduces a progressive training strategy that transitions from radical recognition to broader pictographic-semantic analysis. It also develops a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism and uses a newly designed dataset, the Pictographic Decipherment OBS Dataset, for training and evaluation.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art Top-10 accuracy on public benchmarks and outperforms others in zero-shot decipherment. It also enhances interpretability by providing logical analysis processes.

Conclusion: This work provides a powerful and interpretable tool for deciphering Oracle Bone Script, with significant applications in digital humanities and historical research. It sets a new standard for combining glyph analysis and semantic reasoning in OBS tasks.

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file

### [114] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MANGO, a new approach for explicit multimodal fusion learning, leveraging Normalizing Flow and novel cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models struggle to capture essential features and comprehend complex structures due to reliance on implicit attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow (MANGO) using Invertible Cross-Attention layers with three novel mechanisms: MMCA, IMCA, and LICA.

Result: Experimental results on three multimodal tasks (semantic segmentation, image-to-image translation, movie genre classification) demonstrated state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MANGO is effective for scalable, interpretable multimodal fusion learning and outperforms existing methods in diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [115] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Generative AI-generated synthetic images combined with real images for better watermelon disease classification performance, showing improved outcomes with hybrid datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing reliance on resource-intensive in-field data collection for crop disease diagnosis.

Method: Generative AI was used to create synthetic images, which were combined in different ratios (real-to-synthetic) across five training dataset treatments. An EfficientNetV2-L model was trained using enhanced fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques.

Result: The hybrid datasets (H2, H3, H4) demonstrated higher precision, recall, and F1-scores, with weighted F1-score improving from 0.65 to 1.00 when using a mix of real and synthetic images.

Conclusion: Synthetic and real images must be combined in a hybrid manner to achieve optimal model performance and generalizability for crop disease classification tasks.

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [116] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in industrial domains with limited real-world data by leveraging high-quality synthetic data and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance of VLMs and traditional object detectors significantly degrades in safety-critical domains like industrial spill detection due to data scarcity driven by privacy concerns, data sensitivity, and rare hazardous occurrences.

Method: The authors introduce a scalable framework focusing on generating high-quality synthetic data (SynSpill dataset), which is then used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of VLMs and improvement of detectors such as YOLO and DETR.

Result: Synthetic data enables VLMs and detectors to achieve comparable performances, with VLMs generalizing better to unseen spill scenarios even without synthetic data.

Conclusion: High-fidelity synthetic data combined with lightweight adaptation techniques provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to deploying vision systems in industrial setups lacking sufficient real-world data.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [117] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method (EntropyGS) for compressing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) Gaussians, achieving high compression rates without compromising visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of storing and transmitting 3DGS Gaussians, as the tasks of Gaussian creation and rendering are often separated, necessitating efficient compression.

Method: The paper conducts a statistical analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes, identifies their unique distributions (e.g., Laplace and Gaussian mixtures), and proposes a factorized and parameterized entropy coding method (EntropyGS). The method estimates distribution parameters for entropy coding and adapts quantization based on attribute types.

Result: EntropyGS achieves approximately 30x data rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining comparable rendering quality to the original 3DGS data, with fast encoding and decoding times.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of EntropyGS in efficiently compressing 3DGS data without significant loss of visual quality, offering a practical solution for storage and transmission challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellSymphony is a framework combining Xenium spatial transcriptomics and histology embedding models to achieve precise cell type annotation and uncover tissue microenvironmental niches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to integrate single-cell spatial transcriptomic data with morphological histology information for comprehensive tissue profiling.

Method: CellSymphony uses foundation model-driven embeddings for Xenium transcriptomic profiles and histology images, enabling joint representation learning at single-cell resolution.

Result: The framework facilitates accurate annotation of cell types and identifies microenvironmental niches across three cancer types.

Conclusion: Multimodal fusion and foundational models can enhance understanding of complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in

this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive

### [120] [MRFD: Multi-Region Fusion Decoding with Self-Consistency for Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10264)
*Haonan Ge,Yiwei Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD) to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by improving factual consistency using region-aware prompts and inter-region reliability modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models often generate text that is inconsistent with visual inputs, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Addressing these hallucinations is crucial for improving the accuracy of multimodal outputs.

Method: The proposed MRFD is a training-free decoding technique that leverages cross-attention to identify salient image regions, generates region-specific responses, computes reliability weights using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and fuses the predictions through region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and enhances the factual grounding of responses across various LVLMs and benchmarks, without requiring updates to the underlying models.

Conclusion: MRFD successfully mitigates the issue of textual hallucination in LVLMs and improves output factuality, demonstrating the potential of region-aware reasoning in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

### [121] [Pose-Robust Calibration Strategy for Point-of-Gaze Estimation on Mobile Phones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10268)
*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing point-of-gaze (PoG) estimations across individuals and proposes a dynamic calibration strategy to make PoG estimation more robust to head pose variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Appearance-based PoG estimators struggle to generalize across different individuals due to personal differences and are often sensitive to head pose variations, requiring improved calibration strategies.

Method: The authors constructed the MobilePoG benchmark, analyzed calibration factors, and proposed dynamic calibration where users fixate on points while moving their phones to introduce natural head pose variations.

Result: The proposed dynamic calibration approach significantly improves pose-robustness and accuracy of PoG estimators compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Integrating head pose variations into the calibration process enhances the robustness of PoG estimators, offering a user-friendly and effective solution for addressing pose sensitivity issues.

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

### [122] [High Fidelity Text to Image Generation with Contrastive Alignment and Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10280)
*Danyi Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve the alignment and accuracy in text-driven image generation by using contrastive learning with structural guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven image generation methods struggle with maintaining semantic alignment precision and structural consistency.

Method: The method integrates a text-image contrastive learning module for semantic matching and employs structural priors for guiding spatial-level modeling. Losses for semantic, structural, and alignment optimization are combined in a multi-objective framework.

Result: Experiments on the COCO-2014 dataset demonstrate superior performance in metrics like CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM, ensuring semantic and structural fidelity without added computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively unites semantic alignment and structure fidelity for text-driven image generation, providing a robust solution for high-fidelity modeling and generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

*Ryota Tanaka,Tomohiro Suzuki,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of automating jump recognition in figure skating through a novel action segmentation framework that combines 3D pose datasets and procedural learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate and automated recognition of figure skating jumps due to the expertise needed for detailed analysis and limitations in data and 3D aspects of existing methods.

Method: The researchers developed VIFSS, a view-invariant framework using FS-Jump3D dataset for pose representation and introduced a fine-grained annotation scheme for understanding jump phases.

Result: Achieved over 92% F1@50 performance in recognizing both jump types and rotation levels; highlighted the benefits of efficient pre-training with limited fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances figure skating analysis, combining innovative datasets and procedural learning, proving effective and practical for sports analytics.

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual reasoning benchmarks lack clear reasoning complexity definitions, task customization, and structured annotations. There's a need for tools to evaluate embodied AI agents better in real-world human-crowded settings.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning complexity, design an adaptive query engine for generating customizable questions with detailed annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with new interaction and relationship data.

Result: The JRDB-Reasoning benchmark enables fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment across different reasoning levels.

Conclusion: JRDB-Reasoning bridges key gaps in visual reasoning benchmarks, facilitating improved evaluation of AI systems in structured and customizable ways.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phase consistency weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) method to improve multimodal optical image matching accuracy via coarse and fine matching steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image matching accuracy often degrades due to nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by varying spectral responses in multimodal optical images.

Method: The PCWLAD method involves a two-step process: (1) coarse matching using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) to calculate phase consistency without noise filtering and (2) fine matching using a WLAD-based model incorporating mutual structure filtering for sub-pixel offset estimation.

Result: The proposed method achieved superior performance compared to eight state-of-the-art methods across three datasets, with an average matching accuracy of approximately 0.4 pixels.

Conclusion: PCWLAD significantly improves matching accuracy for multimodal optical images and outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. The authors have also made their software and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InterSyn, a framework that generates realistic multi-person interaction motions by integrating solo and group dynamics, outperforming recent methods in diversity and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion synthesis methods often handle solo and multi-person dynamics separately, leading to less natural and dynamic interactions that fail to capture real-world coordination nuances.

Method: The InterSyn framework integrates two main modules: the INS module for unified modeling of solo and multi-person behaviors from a first-person perspective, and the REC module for refining interactions and ensuring synchronization.

Result: Compared to recent methods, InterSyn produces motion sequences with higher text-to-motion alignment and greater diversity, setting new standards in robust and natural motion synthesis.

Conclusion: InterSyn introduces an innovative approach to motion synthesis, proving its effectiveness and robustness, and its open-source release will foster further advances in this field.

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

TL;DR: This paper surveys out-of-distribution (OoD) segmentation methods, crucial for localizing anomalous objects in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard OoD detection, which cannot localize anomalous objects spatially, by focusing on OoD segmentation for autonomous driving.

Method: The paper categorizes OoD segmentation approaches into four types: test-time segmentation, outlier exposure during supervised training, reconstruction-based methods, and leveraging advanced models.

Result: It systematically reviews and organizes recent developments in OoD segmentation while identifying challenges and potential research directions.

Conclusion: Advanced OoD segmentation enhances safety-critical tasks, but further research is needed to address emerging challenges for robust autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Method: The paper systematically examines RL's evolution, its integration into generative tasks across images, videos, and 3D/4D structures, and its application for optimization and alignment.

Result: RL is shown to enhance generative content's controllability, consistency, and alignment with complex goals across various visual formats.

Conclusion: RL is pivotal for improving generative models, but open challenges remain, and future directions are proposed for advancing this intersection.

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

*Andrew Bai,Justin Cui,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a trade-off in vision-language instruction tuning between learning visual concepts and skills. A targeted data selection framework is introduced to optimize benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover and address the dichotomy in vision-language benchmarks, which benefit differently from training on similar skills versus visual concepts.

Method: The method involves analyzing benchmarks to identify whether they benefit more from similar concepts or skills, then selecting training instructions that match these factors.

Result: The proposed data selection method improves benchmark performance by +0.9% on average across 10+ benchmarks, with +1.5% improvement on skill-focused subsets.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes balancing concept acquisition and visual skill learning for optimal instruction tuning.

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

*Zhentai Zhang,Danyi Weng,Guibin Zhang,Xiang Chen,Kaixing Long,Jian Geng,Yanmeng Lu,Lei Zhang,Zhitao Zhou,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Glo-DMU, a deep learning framework designed to automate the simultaneous quantification of key glomerular ultrastructural features for kidney disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, most research using computational pathology and deep learning focuses on recognizing individual glomerular ultrastructures, limiting their applicability for comprehensive diagnostic needs.

Method: The study developed the Glo-DMU framework using three deep models: ultrastructure segmentation, filtration barrier classification, and electron-dense deposits detection. It quantifies ultrastructural features like glomerular basement membrane thickness, foot process effacement, and deposits' location, mimicking standard renal biopsy protocols.

Result: The framework was evaluated on 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types, showing strong consistency with manual pathological reports in real-world diagnostic settings.

Conclusion: Glo-DMU is a fully automated, precise, and efficient tool for quantifying multiple ultrastructural features, streamlining the diagnostic process and aiding renal pathologists.

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

### [132] [AtomDiffuser: Time-Aware Degradation Modeling for Drift and Beam Damage in STEM Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10359)
*Hao Wang,Hongkui Zheng,Kai He,Abolfazl Razi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AtomDiffuser is a framework that separates spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss in STEM, enabling the study of atomic structure dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in interpreting time-resolved STEM data due to spatial drift and beam-induced signal loss, which distort both geometry and intensity.

Method: Developed AtomDiffuser, a time-aware framework that disentangles degradation effects by predicting transformations and decay maps between STEM frames, trained on synthetic data and generalizing to real-world data.

Result: AtomDiffuser can infer high-resolution degradation, align drift, and visualize radiation-induced atomic instabilities, improving the analysis of dynamic atomic structures in STEM.

Conclusion: The method enables interpretable modeling of material dynamics at atomic resolution and offers tools for better understanding and quantifying degradation patterns in STEM imaging.

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

### [133] [SpaRC-AD: A Baseline for Radar-Camera Fusion in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10567)
*Philipp Wolters,Johannes Gilg,Torben Teepe,Gerhard Rigoll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpaRC-AD, an autonomous driving model using camera-radar fusion to overcome the limitations of vision-based methods in challenging scenarios, delivering significant performance improvements in various driving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of vision-based autonomous systems, especially in adverse conditions, including challenges with adverse weather, occlusions, and velocity estimation, which are crucial for safety and long-term trajectory prediction.

Method: SpaRC-AD leverages a query-based camera-radar fusion approach using sparse 3D feature alignment and doppler-based velocity estimation to create detailed 3D scene representations. This method refines agent anchors, map polylines, and motion modeling to enhance overall performance.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across several tasks: 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 error and -9% TPC).

Conclusion: SpaRC-AD showcases the benefits of radar-based fusion for autonomous driving, especially under safety-critical scenarios requiring accurate motion analysis. Its robustness was proven across real-world and simulated benchmarks, with the source code made publicly accessible for replicability.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Jose Manuel Jaén-Lorites,Jorge Vila-Tomás,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper assesses how well multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) align with human perception by estimating their contrast sensitivity function (CSF), revealing gaps in their visual representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal vision-language models process low-level visual features and how closely their perception aligns with human visual characteristics like the contrast sensitivity function (CSF).

Method: A psychophysics-inspired method was used to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs. This involved prompting models to judge pattern visibility at various spatial frequencies and contrast levels using band-pass filtered noise images.

Result: Findings show that some models approximate human-like CSF shapes or magnitudes but fail to replicate both closely. Additionally, the phrasing of prompts significantly affects model responses, indicating prompt instability.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel framework to evaluate visual sensitivity in VLMs and highlights important gaps between their visual processing and human perception, emphasizing the need for further improvements in representation and stability.

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

### [135] [Towards Spatially Consistent Image Generation: On Incorporating Intrinsic Scene Properties into Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10382)
*Hyundo Lee,Suhyung Choi,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to improve spatial consistency in image generation by co-generating images and their intrinsic scene properties such as depth and segmentation maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation models often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to limited understanding of the underlying scene structures and spatial layouts.

Method: The approach extracts intrinsic scene properties like depth and segmentation maps using pre-trained estimators, encodes these into a single latent variable via an autoencoder, and utilizes pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to denoise both the image and intrinsic domains simultaneously.

Result: This method improves spatial consistency and scene layout in generated images while maintaining fidelity and alignment with textual input.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures underlying scene structures, leading to more realistic and spatially consistent images, enhancing the effectiveness of large-scale diffusion models.

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

### [136] [Unlocking Robust Semantic Segmentation Performance via Label-only Elastic Deformations against Implicit Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10383)
*Yechan Kim,Dongho Yoon,Younkwan Lee,Unse Fatima,Hong Kook Kim,Songjae Lee,Sanga Park,Jeong Ho Park,Seonjong Kang,Moongu Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSegment+, an augmentation method that decouples image and label transformations to address implicit label noise in semantic segmentation, improving model performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of subtle label noise in real-world datasets and mitigating its negative effect on semantic segmentation models.

Method: NSegment+ applies controlled elastic deformations only to the segmentation labels while keeping the original images intact, promoting robust representations of object structures despite label inconsistencies.

Result: The method achieves performance gains (mIoU) of up to +2.29 on Vaihingen, +2.38 on LoveDA, +1.75 on Cityscapes, and +3.39 on PASCAL VOC, even without added complex techniques.

Conclusion: Addressing implicit label noise through decoupled transformations can significantly enhance segmentation model performance, and NSegment+ proves effective both independently and in combination with existing methods.

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

*Haibin Sun,Xinghui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Paper proposes a data augmentation framework (PQ-DAF) using a vision-language model to improve driver distraction detection under few-shot scenarios and domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve driver distraction detection and address challenges like few-shot learning and domain shifts, which hinder model generalization in real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework (PQ-DAF) employing a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) for driver pose features and a vision-language model for quality filtering of synthetic samples.

Result: The PQ-DAF approach significantly enhances cross-domain robustness and model performance in driver distraction detection, especially in conditions with limited data.

Conclusion: PQ-DAF effectively solves issues related to data scarcity and domain shifts, boosting generalization of driver distraction detection models in practical settings.

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

*Eunseo Koh,Seunghoo Hong,Tae-Young Kim,Simon S. Woo,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes techniques to suppress unwanted entangled content in images generated by text-to-image diffusion models using modifications to text embedding and cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in text-to-image diffusion models, there is still difficulty in suppressing strongly entangled content, such as associations between specific objects (e.g., 'mustache' with 'Charlie Chaplin').

Method: The paper introduces a delta vector to adjust text embeddings for weakening undesired content influence and employs a Selective Suppression with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to refine suppression during image generation.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform existing techniques in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the capability of T2I diffusion models to suppress specific associations, with demonstrated improvements in image generation quality.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

*Chaesong Park,Eunbin Seo,Jihyeon Hwang,Jongwoo Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SC-Lane is a 3D lane detection framework focusing on slope-aware and temporally consistent heightmap estimation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous 3D lane detection methods that rely on fixed slope anchors and struggle with dynamic and diverse road geometries.

Method: The paper introduces a Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature module for dynamically weighting slope-specific features and a Height Consistency Module to ensure stability across consecutive frames. These modules are integrated into the SC-Lane framework.

Result: SC-Lane achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenLane benchmark, with an F-score of 64.3%, and demonstrates improvements in height estimation and 3D lane detection.

Conclusion: The SC-Lane framework significantly enhances robustness and accuracy for 3D lane detection tasks, setting a new standard for road height assessment metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NanoControl, a method to enhance controllable text-to-image generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) while minimizing computational overhead and parameter increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and computational overhead of existing methods (like ControlNet) for controllable text-to-image generation using DiTs.

Method: NanoControl introduces a low-rank adaptation (LoRA)-style control module and a KV-Context Augmentation mechanism to reduce parameter duplication and improve conditional information fusion.

Result: NanoControl achieves state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance with minimal increase in parameter count (0.024%) and GFLOPs (0.029%).

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a highly efficient, scalable solution for controllable text-to-image generation, offering superior quality and controllability while drastically reducing computational costs compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STRIDE-QA, a large VQA dataset designed to enhance spatiotemporal reasoning in autonomous driving scenarios, addressing current limitations of VLMs trained on static datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the limitations of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which struggle with spatiotemporal reasoning required for dynamic traffic scenes in autonomous driving.

Method: The researchers developed STRIDE-QA, a dataset built from 100 hours of multi-sensor data in urban driving environments, offering 16 million QA pairs with dense annotations and novel tasks requiring spatial and temporal reasoning.

Result: Benchmarks show that general-purpose VLMs perform poorly on the dataset, while fine-tuning them on STRIDE-QA improves their performance significantly, with gains in spatial localization and motion prediction.

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA provides a robust foundation for advancing Vision-Language Models for safer and more reliable autonomous systems by enabling enhanced spatiotemporal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Motivation: To tackle the challenges of integrating new object categories without forgetting prior ones and ensuring stability during the learning of continual video instance segmentation.

Method: CRISP is based on three components: instance correlation loss for instance tracking, an adaptive residual semantic prompt framework for category-wise learning with contrastive semantic coherence, and an initialization strategy for maintaining inter-task query space correlation.

Result: CRISP achieves superior performance on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets, outperforming other methods and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CRISP presents a robust framework that enhances segmentation and classification performance in continual video instance segmentation, addressing key issues like forgetting and consistency.

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

*Hang Jin,Chenqiang Gao,Junjie Guo,Fangcen Liu,Kanghui Tian,Qinyao Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, DOD-SA, for infrared-visible object detection with single-modality annotations, cutting annotation costs while leveraging cross-modality knowledge transfer and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for infrared-visible object detection require dual-modality annotations, which are costly. This work aims to reduce annotation costs by introducing an approach using single-modality annotations.

Method: The proposed framework, DOD-SA, utilizes a collaborative Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet) with dual branches and introduces a Progressive Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST) for staged model training. Additionally, a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) is designed to align labels across modalities.

Result: Through experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset, the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object detection.

Conclusion: DOD-SA is effective in performing infrared-visible object detection using single-modality annotations. Its design reduces annotation costs while achieving high-quality detection results and offering robust cross-modality knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

*Dhruv Dosi,Rohit Meena,Param Rajpura,Yogesh Kumar Meena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses converting scanned legacy floor plans into machine-readable formats using automated symbol detection methodologies, particularly with the DELP dataset and YOLOv8 model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of machine-readable floor plans makes the interpretation of legacy plans inefficient and error-prone, highlighting the need for scalable and automated solutions for workflows like cost estimation and compliance.

Method: The DELP dataset was introduced with 45 annotated electrical plans, and object detection models like YOLOv8 were benchmarked for symbol spotting. YOLOv8 outperformed others, and the SkeySpot toolkit was developed using this model.

Result: YOLOv8 achieved an mAP of 82.5%, validating its efficiency in detecting and classifying symbols. SkeySpot enables real-time, structured outputs from electrical layout plans.

Conclusion: The proposed method and toolkit reduce reliance on proprietary systems, make digitization accessible to SMEs, and promote standardization in building workflows while ensuring sustainability in the construction sector.

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

*Pablo Hernández-Cámara,Jesus Malo,Valero Laparra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that a bio-inspired PerceptNet model optimized for image reconstruction tasks aligns well with human visual perceptual judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how human visual perception may arise from image statistics by creating a biologically-inspired model aligned with early vision processes like the retina and V1 cortex.

Method: PerceptNet, a bio-inspired neural architecture, was optimized for tasks such as autoencoding, denoising, deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Its performance in image distortion was compared to human perceptual judgments.

Result: PerceptNet's V1-like layer showed the highest correlation with human judgments of image distortion, especially for moderate distortion levels, without being trained on perceptual information.

Conclusion: The study suggests that human visual systems are attuned to specific distortion levels and that bio-inspired models can learn perceptual metrics autonomously.

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

### [146] [Trajectory-aware Shifted State Space Models for Online Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10453)
*Qiang Zhu,Xiandong Meng,Yuxian Jiang,Fan Zhang,David Bull,Shuyuan Zhu,Bing Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TS-Mamba, a novel video super-resolution method for online processing that improves computational efficiency and performance by incorporating trajectory-aware modeling and shifted SSMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing online video super-resolution methods that rely on single neighboring frames and miss long-range temporal modeling, while improving computational efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes TS-Mamba, which uses long-term trajectory-based token selection combined with shifted SSMs for efficient spatio-temporal aggregation. It includes trajectory-aware loss functions for accuracy.

Result: TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across three standard VSR test datasets and significantly reduces computation complexity by over 22.7%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that trajectory-aware modeling using shifted SSMs significantly enhances video super-resolution capabilities while reducing computational effort, making it superior to benchmark models.

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address domain shifts in vegetation plot image prediction by improving multi-label classification models for plant species in multi-species images.

Method: The method uses a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer with multi-head classification leveraging taxonomic hierarchies. It employs multi-scale tiling, dynamic threshold optimization, and ensemble strategies such as bagging and Hydra architectures.

Result: The approach processes 1.4 million images of 7,806 plant species to achieve 3rd place in the PlantCLEF 2025 private leaderboard.

Conclusion: The multi-head vision transformer methodology effectively adapts to domain shifts, proving robust in the PlantCLEF challenge and providing impactful contributions to multi-label plant species classification tasks.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.
Our methodology leverages a pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer Base
(ViT-B/14) backbone with multiple classification heads for species, genus, and
family prediction, utilizing taxonomic hierarchies. Key contributions include
multi-scale tiling to capture plants at different scales, dynamic threshold
optimization based on mean prediction length, and ensemble strategies through
bagging and Hydra model architectures. The approach incorporates various
inference techniques including image cropping to remove non-plant artifacts,
top-n filtering for prediction constraints, and logit thresholding strategies.
Experiments were conducted on approximately 1.4 million training images
covering 7,806 plant species. Results demonstrate strong performance, making
our submission 3rd best on the private leaderboard. Our code is available at

### [148] [SingleStrip: learning skull-stripping from a single labeled example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10464)
*Bella Specktor-Fadida,Malte Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a combination of domain randomization and self-training techniques to train skull-stripping networks using minimal labeled data, achieving competitive performance in brain MRI segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating manually labeled data for volumetric images like brain MRI is labor-intensive and time-consuming. The paper aims to alleviate this dependency while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Method: The method involves three steps: (1) Using voxel intensities to synthesize images for an initial model via domain randomization. (2) Training a convolutional autoencoder (AE) for assessing segmentation quality. (3) Fine-tuning the model using high-quality, self-labeled pseudo-labels.

Result: The proposed approach achieved skull-stripping performance close to models trained on more extensive labeled datasets, especially when using AE-based ranking for quality control.

Conclusion: Combining domain randomization and AE-based ranking makes it feasible to train effective segmentation models with minimal labeled data, potentially accelerating progress in less-explored anatomical studies.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

*Maimunatu Tunau,Vincent Gbouna Zakka,Zhuangzhuang Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates and enhances three widely-used data processing methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering) for Human Action Recognition (HAR) using mmWave radar to address the privacy and data noise challenges, while optimizing accuracy and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns in HAR systems by using mmWave radar sensors instead of traditional vision-based systems, and to tackle the challenge of noisy and sparse data from radars by comprehensively evaluating and improving existing data processing methods.

Method: Three primary data processing methods (DBSCAN, Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering) are evaluated individually, in pairwise combinations, and in a fully integrated combination using the MiliPoint dataset to assess recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. Enhancements to the individual methods are also proposed.

Result: The analysis provides detailed insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs of the individual methods and their integrations, highlighting how each method and its combination affect both accuracy and computational cost.

Conclusion: The findings guide the design of future mmWave-based HAR systems by offering a better understanding of existing methods' performance and showing how optimized combinations can balance accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep learning model, STAMP, for diagnosing STAS in lung adenocarcinoma using multi-center histopathology images, achieving competitive results surpassing clinical standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the labor-intensive and error-prone nature of diagnosing STAS in lung adenocarcinoma, there is a need for innovative approaches leveraging deep learning models for better accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The STAMP framework employs a dual-branch architecture for learning distinct pathological features, incorporates transformer-based encoding, and uses multi-pattern attention modules to focus on STAS-relevant regions while suppressing noise and preventing feature redundancy.

Result: STAMP achieved state-of-the-art diagnostic AUCs (0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928) on different datasets, outperforming clinical-level diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: STAMP offers an advanced and reliable method for diagnosing STAS in lung adenocarcinoma, minimizing challenges in traditional pathology and paving the way for improved clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

*Jianda Mao,Kaibo Wang,Yang Xiang,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TweezeEdit is a framework for text-guided image editing, focusing on semantic preservation and efficiency without tuning or inversion reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in maintaining source semantics and inefficiencies in existing image editing methods driven by pre-trained diffusion models.

Method: A tuning- and inversion-free framework using gradient-driven regularization and a consistency model for efficient and semantically-preserved image edits.

Result: TweezeEdit outperforms prior methods in semantic retention and target alignment, with fast editing requiring only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit).

Conclusion: TweezeEdit demonstrates a significant advancement in real-time, text-guided image editing by balancing efficiency and semantic accuracy, outperforming existing frameworks.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces an optimization framework for improved 3D Gaussian splatting in novel view synthesis, focusing on fine detail preservation via dual geometric constraints and multisample anti-aliasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blurry reconstructions in 3D Gaussian splatting are caused by insufficient geometric constraints, especially in regions with textures and discontinuities.

Method: The framework combines multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with adaptive blending of subsamples and introduces two geometric constraints: adaptive weighting for under-reconstructed regions and gradient differential constraints for boundary regularization.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation by enhancing high-frequency textures and discontinuities while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves structural and perceptual quality, outperforming baseline methods on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining
real-time rendering efficiency. Quantitative metrics and perceptual studies
confirm statistically significant improvements over baseline approaches in both
structural similarity (SSIM) and perceptual quality (LPIPS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method called Segmentation-Driven Bolt Defect Editing (SBDE) to deal with data scarcity and imbalance in detecting bolt defects in transmission lines. They propose new components to create high-quality defect images that improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve bolt defect detection critical for the safety of transmission lines, which is hindered by inadequate and imbalanced defect image datasets.

Method: The researchers developed SBDE, which includes a segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) for high-quality masking, a mask optimization module integrated with an inpainting model (MOD-LaMa) for defect attribute editing, and an augmentation strategy (ERA) to enhance datasets.

Result: The SBDE method outperformed state-of-the-art image editing models in generating defect images and significantly improved defect detection performance across experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed SBDE method proves to be effective and has great potential for application in improving bolt defect detection. It addresses dataset issues while boosting detection accuracy.

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for predicting human dance motion using both egocentric video and music, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of estimating human dance motion using both egocentric video and music inputs remains unexplored, with challenges in full-pose estimation and alignment of movements to inputs.

Method: The authors introduce EgoAIST++, a large-scale dataset combining egocentric views and music, and develop EgoMusic Motion Network powered by Skeleton Mamba for modeling human body skeleton structures.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the challenges of integrating egocentric video and music inputs, advancing motion prediction technology for practical applications.

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in unified understanding and comparison across various methodologies and evaluation protocols of visual reasoning.

Method: The survey categorizes visual reasoning types, reviews architectural implementations, analyzes evaluation protocols, and highlights challenges and gaps in the field.

Result: A systematic categorization of visual reasoning types, identification of limitations across current evaluation protocols, and open challenges like scalability, dataset deficiencies, and weak supervision are highlighted.

Conclusion: Bridging perception and reasoning is deemed essential for future adaptive AI systems in critical domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical

### [156] [Med-GLIP: Advancing Medical Language-Image Pre-training with Large-scale Grounded Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10528)
*Ziye Deng,Ruihan He,Jiaxiang Liu,Yuan Wang,Zijie Meng,Songtao Jiang,Yong Xie,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Med-GLIP-5M, a large-scale medical grounding dataset, and the Med-GLIP framework for aligning language and regions in medical images, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve medical image grounding tasks by addressing challenges like limited modality coverage, coarse annotations, and lack of a unified framework.

Method: A dataset (Med-GLIP-5M) with 5.3M region-level annotations spanning seven imaging modalities is created; the Med-GLIP framework is trained on this to achieve modality-aware and multi-granularity grounding.

Result: Med-GLIP outperforms existing methods on grounding benchmarks and enhances downstream tasks like medical VQA and report generation.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP and its dataset offer a significant advancement in medical image analysis by improving grounding accuracy and benefiting related applications.

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

### [157] [GCRPNet: Graph-Enhanced Contextual and Regional Perception Network For Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10542)
*Mengyu Ren,Yutong Li,Hua Li,Runmin Cong,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses salient object detection (SOD) challenges in optical remote sensing images by proposing GCRPNet, a novel architecture that combines graph-based enhancements with tailored encoder and decoder modules to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the challenges in detecting salient objects in optical remote sensing images, such as variations in target scales and low target-background contrast, coupled with the need for effectively integrating global and local features from ViTs and CNNs.

Method: The authors propose GCRPNet, based on Mamba architecture, featuring the VSS encoder, the DS-HGAM module to enhance cross-layer and structural features, and the LEVSS decoder, which includes an adaptive scanning strategy and MCAEM for improved local-region information capture.

Result: The proposed GCRPNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in salient object detection for optical remote sensing images, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: GCRPNet effectively overcomes the limitations of prior methods by integrating long-range and regional feature representations, achieving superior detection performance.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

### [158] [PSScreen: Partially Supervised Multiple Retinal Disease Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10549)
*Boyi Zheng,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSScreen, a novel model for multi-retinal disease screening using partially labeled datasets. It addresses challenges like domain shifts and label absence by employing two feature streams and leveraging textual guidance, among other techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to reduce dependency on fully annotated datasets for retinal disease screening while overcoming challenges such as domain shifts and partial label availability.

Method: PSScreen utilizes two streams for learning deterministic and probabilistic features. These are aligned via feature distillation, textual guidance, and pseudo-label consistency. Self-distillation further transfers semantic information to enhance detection performance.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant performance enhancements on six retinal diseases as well as the normal state, achieving state-of-the-art results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves the robustness and generalization ability of retinal disease screening models, contributing to more effective use of partially labeled medical datasets.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

*Marc J. Fischer,Jeffrey Potts,Gabriel Urreola,Dax Jones,Paolo Palmisciano,E. Bradley Strong,Branden Cord,Andrew D. Hernandez,Julia D. Sharma,E. Brandon Strong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AR-based surgical navigation system using Microsoft HoloLens 2 for precision catheter placement, showcasing improved accuracy and usability metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR surgical navigation systems aim to overcome issues like depth perception conflicts and occlusion challenges in conventional systems. Enhanced accuracy and usability in surgical procedures are critical motivations.

Method: The study utilizes Microsoft HoloLens 2's onboard sensors for real-time AR guidance, featuring static visualization and live tool-tracking methodologies applied to phantom models.

Result: The tool-tracking guidance method delivered better accuracy (target deviation, angular error, depth precision) and was preferred by users according to surveys.

Conclusion: AR navigation systems with real-time tool tracking significantly enhance surgical precision and user satisfaction, showcasing potential for adoption in surgical practices.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

*Ruisong Han,Zongbo Han,Jiahao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Changqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP) which uses external knowledge to enhance Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods struggle with limited and mismatched outliers, leading to insufficient semantic supervision and suboptimal results.

Method: The proposed method, RAP, augments prompts in a pre-trained vision-language model by retrieving external knowledge, using descriptive words for outliers during training and dynamically updating prompts during testing.

Result: RAP significantly outperforms existing methods, showing a 7.05% reduction in FPR95 and a 1.71% improvement in AUROC in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieving external knowledge for augmenting OOD detection, providing a strong approach for adapting to real-world test environments.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

### [161] [PTQAT: A Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Quantization Algorithm for 3D Perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10557)
*Xinhao Wang,Zhiwei Lin,Zhongyu Xia,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTQAT, a novel hybrid quantization algorithm combining PTQ and QAT for 3D perception networks, achieving comparable accuracy to QAT with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ leads to performance issues, while QAT requires extensive resources and time. The authors aim to find a middle ground between these two approaches.

Method: The PTQAT method selectively applies QAT to critical layers with smaller quantization discrepancies and uses PTQ for other layers, compensating quantization errors more effectively during their propagation.

Result: PTQAT achieves comparable or better accuracy than QAT while improving efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned layers by approximately 50%, and supporting various architectures and quantization bit widths.

Conclusion: PTQAT provides an efficient and universal solution for quantizing 3D perception networks, delivering strong performance gains across different tasks and architectures while requiring less computational effort.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

*Shiyu Liu,Kui Jiang,Xianming Liu,Hongxun Yao,Xiaocheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HM-Talker proposes a method for audio-driven talking head generation, focusing on improving visual quality and lip-sync accuracy by using a hybrid motion representation that combines explicit and implicit motion cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in audio-driven talking head video generation, such as motion blur and lip jitter, by incorporating explicit articulatory priors for improving audio-facial motion modeling.

Method: Introduces a hybrid motion representation using Action Units (AUs) for explicit cues and implicit features. A Cross-Modal Disentanglement Module (CMDM) and Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM) are designed for better modeling of audio-visual motion correlations.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: HM-Talker enhances the robustness and generalization of talking head synthesis by effectively combining explicit and implicit motion cues for high-fidelity temporally coherent outputs.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes fine-tuning the SAM foundational model for remote sensing change detection (RSCD) and introduces methods to enhance its performance, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In remote sensing, detecting changes in areas over time is crucial but challenging due to high class imbalance and multi-scale complexities. Existing methods need improvement in robustness and accuracy.

Method: The paper fine-tunes SAM's encoder for RSCD and incorporates spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF). A novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss is also proposed to address class imbalance.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across four change detection datasets, achieving a 2.5% F1-score improvement on the S2Looking dataset.

Conclusion: The enhanced SAM model demonstrates robust and accurate change detection capabilities, showing promise for applications in remote sensing and advancing the state of the art in this domain.

Abstract: Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of
computer vision. They learn general representations that are easily
transferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is
Segment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.
We propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change
detection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and
multi-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple
scales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to
handle high class imbalance in change detection datasets. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four change detection datasets,
Levir-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, and S2Looking. We achieved 2.5% F1-score improvement on
a large complex S2Looking dataset. The code is available at:

### [164] [Towards Agentic AI for Multimodal-Guided Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10572)
*Tuyen Tran,Thao Minh Le,Truyen Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Multi-Modal Agent for referring-based video object segmentation, using large language models for adaptive workflows and achieving better performance than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for referring-based video object segmentation generally require specialized models with high computational costs and manual annotation. Recent advancements in vision-language models suggest a shift toward training-free methods, but existing systems lack adaptability to dynamic task requirements.

Method: The paper introduces Multi-Modal Agent, a system that uses the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to create customized dynamic workflows for segmenting objects. These workflows interact iteratively with specialized tools designed for low-level tasks in multiple modalities.

Result: Their approach outperforms previous methods in two specific multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks—RVOS and Ref-AVS—demonstrating its efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic, adaptive approach leverages language models and multimodal tools, providing a significant improvement in flexibility and precision over static, training-intensive segmentation pipelines.

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

*Zheng Qin,Ruobing Zheng,Yabing Wang,Tianqi Li,Yi Yuan,Jingdong Chen,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HumanSense benchmark evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on human-centered perception and interaction in complex contexts, highlighting the need for improved reasoning abilities and feedback formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for assessing MLLMs in human-centered scenarios, focusing on complex intention understanding and empathetic responses.

Method: The researchers created the HumanSense benchmark, integrated multi-stage and modality-progressive reinforcement learning for reasoning improvements, and designed targeted prompts to enhance model performance.

Result: The study identifies considerable gaps in interaction capabilities of leading MLLMs, shows advantages of omni-modal models, achieves evaluation gains using reinforcement learning, and enhances non-reasoning models with prompts.

Conclusion: MLLMs require better reasoning and contextual abilities for improved human-centered interactions. The HumanSense framework provides insights to bridge these gaps.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for
achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of
fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvTurb, a framework using event streams to address image degradation caused by atmospheric turbulence, and presents a novel dataset, TurbEvent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from challenges in computer vision tasks due to atmospheric turbulence effects, which degrade image quality via blur and geometric distortions.

Method: The method entails a two-step event-guided network leveraging event integrals to reduce blur and variance maps to mitigate tilt distortion, supported by an event-based turbulence model.

Result: EvTurb significantly outperforms existing approaches in addressing turbulence effects, as supported by experimental evaluations on diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: EvTurb effectively reduces turbulence distortions in images, demonstrated through a compelling dataset, and offers a computationally efficient alternative for improved image quality.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

*Yuxin Cao,Yedi Zhang,Wentao He,Yifan Liao,Yan Xiao,Chang Li,Zhiyong Huang,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses safety and security challenges of autonomous driving systems under black-box adversarial patch attacks, proposing a new attack framework (P$^3$A) optimized for high-resolution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome vulnerabilities in autonomous driving systems against adversarial patches, refine metrics for black-box attacks, and improve attack transferability in practical and high-resolution scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces the Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR) metric, Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) for improving transferability, and Probabilistic Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) for preprocessing high-resolution data.

Result: P$^3$A demonstrates superior performance in attacking unseen models and high-resolution datasets, achieving better metrics accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances attack success and transferability under realistic conditions, increasing risks for autonomous systems while advancing defensive understanding.

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), an innovative upsampling module focused on improving high-frequency detail reconstruction and reducing aliasing artifacts in single image super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional upsampling methods, despite being efficient, often fail to reconstruct high-frequency details and introduce undesired aliasing artifacts. The paper aims to build an effective and lightweight module capable of addressing these limitations.

Method: FGA combines three key innovations: (1) Fourier feature-based MLP for encoding positional frequencies, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention Layer for spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for spectral fidelity supervision.

Result: Integrating FGA delivers superior performance across diverse super-resolution models with minimal parameter cost (0.3M). It achieves average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improves frequency-domain consistency by up to 29%, especially on texture-rich datasets.

Conclusion: FGA is a scalable, effective alternative to conventional upsamplers, excelling in reducing aliasing artifacts and preserving fine details in super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIND-Net, a novel framework for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) in CT imaging, combining frequency and spatial domain processing using advanced techniques for improved artifact suppression and structural preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the challenge of metal artifacts in CT imaging, which degrade image quality and hinder diagnostic accuracy. Existing deep learning methods often struggle to balance artifact suppression and preservation of structural details.

Method: The proposed approach, FIND-Net, integrates Fourier-Inspired layers and trainable Gaussian filters into a MAR framework. It treats MAR as a hybrid task in both spatial and frequency domains using Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers, enhancing global contextual understanding and frequency selectivity.

Result: FIND-Net shows superior performance over state-of-the-art MAR methods on synthetic datasets, with a reduction of metal artifacts (e.g., 3.07% MAE reduction), and improved structural preservation, as verified by clinical CT scan evaluations.

Conclusion: FIND-Net demonstrates statistically significant improvements in reducing metal artifacts while preserving clinical-relevant structures, highlighting its potential for better diagnostic applicability in medical imaging.

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

### [170] [Increasing the Utility of Synthetic Images through Chamfer Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10631)
*Nicola Dall'Asen,Xiaofeng Zhang,Reyhane Askari Hemmat,Melissa Hall,Jakob Verbeek,Adriana Romero-Soriano,Michal Drozdzal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Chamfer Guidance, a training-free method for enhancing synthetic image data diversity and quality using exemplars of real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve diversity and utility of synthetic image data for generative models while addressing distribution shifts between synthetic and real data.

Method: Chamfer Guidance uses real exemplar images to guide synthetic data generation without requiring training or unconditional models.

Result: Chamfer Guidance achieves state-of-the-art diversity and quality benchmarks, with notable precision and distributional coverage improvements using as few as 2 real images.

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance enhances diversity and quality of synthetic data while reducing computational costs, boosting classifier accuracy for in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

*Hosam Elgendy,Ahmed Sharshar,Ahmed Aboeitta,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChatENV is an interactive vision-language model designed for environmental monitoring, reasoning over satellite imagery and sensor data, enabled by a rich dataset and fine-tuned adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inadequacies in current vision-language models, which fail to incorporate environmental sensor data, exhibit stylistic biases, and lack interactive reasoning for applications like climate resilience and urban planning.

Method: The method involves building a dataset with 152k satellite image pairs and sensor metadata, annotating with GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 for semantic diversity, and fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-VL using LoRA adapters for interactive reasoning.

Result: ChatENV shows strong performance in reasoning tasks (BERT-F1 0.903), surpassing other temporal models and supporting scenario-based analysis.

Conclusion: ChatENV represents a significant advancement in environmental monitoring by integrating satellite imagery with sensor data and enabling sophisticated interactive analysis.

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

*Ryan Ramos,Vladan Stojnić,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Yuta Nakashima,Giorgos Tolias,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how subtle image acquisition parameters, often imperceptible to humans, can influence visual encoder performance by affecting semantic predictions both positively and negatively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how subtle and often overlooked image acquisition or processing parameters impact visual encoder performance, as opposed to the more studied severe image distortions.

Method: The analysis focused on tracing how parameters from the image acquisition process are systematically encoded into visual representations and assessing their effects on semantic predictions.

Result: Findings indicate these acquisition-based parameters are indeed encoded in visual representations and can significantly impact predictions, depending on their correlation (positive or negative) with semantic labels.

Conclusion: Subtle image acquisition traces embedded in visual encoders have a significant, nuanced impact on model predictions, providing insights into model robustness under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

*Helena Russello,Rik van der Tol,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a lameness detection method for cows using pose estimation and BLSTM, achieving 85% accuracy with minimal video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve lameness detection in cows by eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and enabling the method to work with small data and short video clips.

Method: The method utilizes markerless pose estimation (T-LEAP) to extract motion sequences of nine keypoints on cows, which are input into a BLSTM classifier for binary classification.

Result: The proposed approach achieved 85% accuracy, significantly outperforming a previous feature-based method with 80% accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that lameness can be accurately detected using pose estimation and BLSTM with minimal data and without manual feature engineering.

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

*Xiao Shi,Yangjun Ou,Zhenzhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT) to enhance generalization in unseen visual categories using shared attribute-level knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of balancing category-specific representation and transferable knowledge for unseen visual categories in transfer learning.

Method: The authors introduce SemPT, which uses a two-step process to extract shared visual attributes and generate descriptions, then applies visually guided weighting to improve embeddings and their alignment between seen and unseen categories.

Result: SemPT outperformed existing methods on 15 benchmark datasets, showcasing superior results in generalization tasks like base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot learning.

Conclusion: Semantic Prompt Tuning provides a scalable and effective approach for leveraging transferable attribute-level knowledge, enabling better generalization to unseen visual categories.

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

*Zhangyong Tang,Tianyang Xu,Xuefeng Zhu,Chunyang Cheng,Tao Zhou,Xiaojun Wu,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniBench300, a unified benchmark for multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), and explores continual learning to tackle knowledge forgetting during task unification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inconsistencies caused by a lack of unified benchmarks for different multi-modal data types during training and testing, which leads to degraded tracking system performance.

Method: The paper introduces UniBench300 to consolidate multiple task data into one system and reformulates the unification process in a serial format, incorporating continual learning to mitigate knowledge forgetting.

Result: Experiments show UniBench300 reduces time consumption by 27% and demonstrate continual learning helps maintain stable unification. Moreover, performance degradation correlates with network capacity and varies across modalities.

Conclusion: UniBench300 effectively bridges training-testing inconsistencies, and continual learning proves useful in unifying multi-modal visual object tracking tasks with enhanced stability and insights for future research.

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

*Shixiong Xu,Chenghao Zhang,Lubin Fan,Yuan Zhou,Bin Fan,Shiming Xiang,Gaofeng Meng,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AddressVLM, a model that integrates city-wide address localization into large visual language models using street-view and satellite imagery with two-stage training protocols. It achieves significantly better performance in street-level localization than existing LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with fine-grained street-level localization despite performing well at broader geo-localization tasks. Enhancing their capabilities for detailed address localization is essential for urban visual question answering.

Method: The researchers introduce a model incorporating perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues along with cross-view alignment tuning and an automatic label generation mechanism. This is coupled with two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment and address localization tuning.

Result: The proposed AddressVLM model improves address localization accuracy by over 9% in Pittsburgh and 12% in San Francisco compared to traditional LVLMs, as demonstrated on newly constructed street-view VQA datasets.

Conclusion: By enhancing LVLMs with macro-satellite cues and cross-view alignment mechanisms, AddressVLM significantly improves fine-grained address localization capabilities, indicating promise for broader applications in urban environments.

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for creating a high-quality, non-overlapping face dataset for training face recognition models, utilizing advanced cleaning techniques, synthetic identity generation, and curriculum learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to construct a specialized face dataset that does not overlap with public datasets, enabling the training of improved face recognition models.

Method: The authors use a Mixture-of-Experts strategy for dataset cleaning, generate synthetic identities via Stable Diffusion and Vec2Face, and adopt curriculum learning to address visual similarity among identities.

Result: The constructed dataset improves model performance across multiple identity scales and won first place in the DataCV ICCV Challenge.

Conclusion: Their approach efficiently creates a diverse and high-quality dataset, demonstrating its impact on face recognition model accuracy while ensuring non-overlapping identities with public datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperTea, a novel method integrating CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs to improve moving infrared small target detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with small target sizes, weak intensity, and complex motion patterns in MIRSTD.

Method: HyperTea utilizes global and local temporal enhancement modules along with a temporal alignment module to model high-order spatiotemporal correlations.

Result: Experiments confirm HyperTea achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on DAUB and IRDST datasets.

Conclusion: HyperTea establishes a new standard by effectively combining CNNs, RNNs, and HGNNs for advanced infrared detection tasks.

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI, focusing on mid-field (0.55T) systems. It tackles challenges like motion corruption and scan time using joint reconstruction across echo times (TEs), combining neural representations and physics-informed regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fetal brain MRI T2 mapping methods are hindered by long scan times and motion sensitivity, especially on mid-field systems where T2 decay is slower.

Method: The proposed approach uses implicit neural representations integrated with physics-informed regularization for T2 decay modeling, allowing joint reconstruction across TEs and reducing motion artifacts.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain data and adult datasets with fetal-like motion. It also provides the first in vivo fetal T2 mapping at 0.55T.

Conclusion: This novel technique shows the potential to reduce stack acquisitions in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy, offering improved imaging fidelity and shorter scan durations.

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IADGPT, a framework for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) that incorporates progressive training and reasoning abilities inspired by humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) lack specific industrial knowledge and reasoning capabilities needed for anomaly detection, limiting their effectiveness compared to human inspectors.

Method: IADGPT uses a three-stage progressive training strategy to instill fundamental industrial knowledge, discrepancy awareness, and leverages in-context learning with few-shot exemplars. Additionally, it employs anomaly scoring strategies via logits output, attention maps, and language output for reasoning.

Result: Experiments show that IADGPT achieves significant performance improvements in anomaly detection, localization, and reasoning tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: IADGPT is a human-like FS-IAD framework enhancing industrial quality inspection processes. The accompanying dataset will be made publicly available post camera-ready.

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

*Sehajdeep SIngh,A V Subramanyam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing a novel view from a single image, using a lightweight framework combined with a pretrained diffusion model to improve reconstruction quality and geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for novel view synthesis suffer from high computational costs, blurry reconstructions, and limited generalization abilities, creating a need for a more efficient and effective solution.

Method: The approach involves using a pretrained diffusion model and a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net (TUNet) to predict latent representations of the desired view. A novel fusion strategy is employed to preserve texture and fine-grained details, leveraging noise correlation in DDIM inversion.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in extensive experiments conducted on the MVImgNet dataset.

Conclusion: The method combines generative capabilities of pretrained models with innovative fusion strategies, leading to state-of-the-art results in single-image novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFNet integrates a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to enhance object detection in complex traffic environments under challenging lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RGB cameras struggle with low global contrast and loss of detail in challenging lighting conditions, which hampers object detection and feature extraction.

Method: MCFNet utilizes an event correction module for temporal alignment, an event dynamic upsampling module for spatial alignment, and a cross-modal mamba fusion module for adaptive feature integration.

Result: MCFNet achieved significant performance improvement on datasets, surpassing the best existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed fusion network effectively addresses limitations of conventional cameras, enhancing object detection in poor lighting conditions and demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The

### [183] [CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710)
*Joohyeon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CountCluster, a method for improving object count accuracy in text-to-image models by clustering cross-attention maps during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image generation models struggle to accurately reflect the number of objects specified in input prompts, particularly in early denoising steps.

Method: CountCluster partitions object cross-attention maps into clusters based on attention scores and aligns them with an ideal spatial distribution during inference without external modules or additional training.

Result: CountCluster achieves an 18.5% improvement in object count accuracy and better quantity control performance across varied prompts compared to other methods.

Conclusion: CountCluster effectively addresses the challenge of object count accuracy in image generation, providing a practical, inference-time solution without external tools or retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing AR models which either rely on computationally burdensome diffusion or suffer from quantization loss in VQ methods.

Method: The researchers developed NextStep-1 with a 14B AR model and a 157M flow matching head, using discrete text tokens and continuous image tokens trained with next-token prediction objectives.

Conclusion: NextStep-1 offers high-fidelity image synthesis and versatility in editing, advancing AR modeling without diffusion or quantization losses, with open code and model access for further research.

Abstract: Prevailing autoregressive (AR) models for text-to-image generation either
rely on heavy, computationally-intensive diffusion models to process continuous
image tokens, or employ vector quantization (VQ) to obtain discrete tokens with
quantization loss. In this paper, we push the autoregressive paradigm forward
with NextStep-1, a 14B autoregressive model paired with a 157M flow matching

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A proposed method, SegDAC, enhances visual reinforcement learning by leveraging advanced segmentation techniques and a novel architecture. It significantly improves visual generalization and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of learning perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards in visual reinforcement learning.

Method: SegDAC integrates Segment Anything (SAM), YOLO-World for semantic grounding, and a novel transformer-based architecture that dynamically handles object segments, focusing on key elements through RL without human labels.

Result: The method demonstrated strong visual generalization, achieving twice the performance of prior approaches in challenging benchmarks and improving sample efficiency across tasks.

Conclusion: SegDAC provides a state-of-the-art solution to visual reinforcement learning challenges, combining segmentation tools and RL techniques to improve efficiency and generalization in diverse settings.

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

*Fabian Kresse,Georgios Pilikos,Mario Azcueta,Nicolas Floury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using neural networks for real-time processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to overcome bandwidth and latency issues for maritime vessel monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for maritime vessel monitoring with SAR data rely on ground processing, which faces bandwidth limitations and latency issues. On-board processing could alleviate these problems but encounters challenges due to resource constraints.

Method: The authors propose and evaluate neural networks tailored for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data in different modes, including deployment on FPGA for on-board processing.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates the feasibility of on-board processing with neural networks and achieves accurate binary classification of ships and windmills.

Conclusion: On-board SAR data processing using neural networks is a practical solution to reduce bandwidth constraints and latency, presenting promising implications for real-time maritime surveillance.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

### [187] [Revisiting Cross-View Localization from Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10716)
*Panwang Xia,Qiong Wu,Lei Yu,Yi Liu,Mingtao Xiong,Lei Liang,Yongjun Zhang,Yi Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses cross-view localization for ground-view and aerial imagery, introducing novel techniques to improve image matching and localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view localization is crucial for GNSS-denied environments like urban canyons and disaster zones, but existing methods struggle with fine-grained matching due to geometrically inconsistent matches.

Method: The framework utilizes a Surface Model for accurate BEV projection and a SimRefiner module to refine similarity matrices without post-processing, complemented by a new CVFM benchmark dataset.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances localization accuracy and image matching quality, establishing new benchmarks under extreme viewpoint disparities.

Conclusion: The paper offers an improved cross-view localization framework with better interpretability, supported by a new comprehensive benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

*Longxiang Tang,Ruihang Chu,Xiang Wang,Yujin Han,Pingyu Wu,Chunming He,Yingya Zhang,Shiwei Zhang,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCPE as a replacement for k-means clustering in token-based image generation, enhancing the utilization of token similarity information within a codebook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Various autoregressive image generation models fail to utilize the rich token similarity information encoded within the codebook, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: The authors propose DCPE, leveraging instance-based distance instead of centroid-based distance in clustering, coupled with agglomerative merging to mitigate token space disparity.

Result: DCPE improves training efficiency by 42% and boosts model performance metrics like FID and IS in image generation systems.

Conclusion: DCPE provides a more effective way to extract codebook priors, enhancing autoregressive models' efficiency and performance while seamlessly integrating with existing systems.

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

*Yanjun Li,Yuqian Fu,Tianwen Qian,Qi'ao Xu,Silong Dai,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool,Xiaoling Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EgoCross, a benchmark designed to test cross-domain generalization of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in egocentric video question answering (EgocentricQA) across diverse domains such as surgery, industry, extreme sports, and animal perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on EgocentricQA focus on common daily activities and lack the evaluation of cross-domain generalization performance. Real-world applications need models that can handle domain shifts.

Method: EgoCross includes approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips, spanning four QA tasks (prediction, recognition, localization, and counting), and supports both OpenQA and CloseQA formats. The authors also test model improvements using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Extensive experiments indicated that current MLLMs struggle with cross-domain generalization. Models perform well in daily life activities but fail to adapt to specialized domains covered by EgoCross.

Conclusion: The EgoCross benchmark exposes the limitations of existing MLLMs in cross-domain scenarios and provides a foundation for developing more domain-adaptive and robust egocentric video understanding models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be
released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConGCD bridges gaps in generalized category discovery (GCD) using a human-inspired approach that deconstructs objects into visual primitives and employs consensus-oriented processing for better pattern recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing GCD methods that primarily focus on optimizing objective functions, by taking inspiration from the human cognitive process for recognizing novel objects.

Method: The authors introduce ConGCD, which employs primitive-oriented representations, deconstruction to bind intra-class shared attributes, and a consensus framework based on human-like dominant and contextual cues. A dynamic scheduler optimizes activation pathways and final predictions.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness across both coarse-grained and fine-grained classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: ConGCD represents a novel paradigm in GCD by providing a consensus-aware and human-inspired methodology for improved discovery and recognition of both novel and known object categories.

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

TL;DR: The 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking Competition (SSBC) assessed the performance of privacy-preserving sclera-segmentation models using synthetic data and limited real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in training segmentation models for privacy-aware biometric systems, comparing it to real-world data.

Method: The competition featured two tracks: solely synthetic data and mixed synthetic-real data, with submissions from nine research groups employing various model architectures tested across diverse datasets.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data were competitive with over 0.8 F1 scores in some cases; performance gains were driven by methodological innovations rather than the real data inclusion.

Conclusion: Synthetic data holds great promise for privacy-aware biometric systems, with methodology playing a critical role in model performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

*Wongyun Yu,Ahyun Seo,Minsu Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to detect reflection and rotational symmetry in complex scenes using geometric primitives, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting symmetry in complex scenes has been a challenging problem in computer vision despite its fundamental importance.

Method: The authors propose a dual-branch architecture equivariant to the dihedral group, with specialized features for reflection and rotation symmetry detection.

Result: Their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing symmetry detection methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies individual axes of reflection and rotational centers, providing a precise and robust solution to symmetry detection challenges.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

*Lixin Jia,Zhiqing Guo,Gaobo Yang,Liejun Wang,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current deepfake detection methods in handling unknown forgery techniques, proposing a strategy that significantly enhances generalization capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection methods struggle with cross-domain challenges and poor performance against unknown forgery techniques, necessitating improved generalization capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces Forgery Guided Learning (FGL) for adaptive learning and a Dual Perception Network (DPNet) to extract forgery features dynamically using frequency and spatial streams, supported by graph convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach is effective in generalizing across varied scenarios and handling unknown forgery techniques, surpassing traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods improve detection effectiveness against evolving deepfake technologies, offering robust support for generalization in cross-domain applications.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code
is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/FGL.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DARC, a model-driven framework for constructing anatomically accurate atlases in medical imaging, addressing scalability, memory efficiency, and generalizability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing data-driven and model-driven atlas construction methods, including reliance on large datasets, poor generalizability, and scaling issues for 3D images.

Method: The paper proposes DARC, a groupwise registration framework using a coordinate descent strategy and a centrality-enforcing activation function, enabling unbiased and scalable atlas construction with high image fidelity.

Result: DARC achieves efficient handling of multiple 3D images while ensuring diffeomorphic and unbiased atlases. It supports one-shot segmentation, outperforming existing methods, and enables shape synthesis by deforming anatomical models.

Conclusion: DARC presents a scalable, generalizable, and resource-efficient solution for atlas construction, offering high anatomical fidelity and enabling impactful applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding real-world physics is a crucial capability for building robust models, but the spatio-physical reasoning capabilities of VLMs remain largely unexplored.

Method: The study diagnosed current VLMs' limitations, then applied supervised fine-tuning and rule-based reinforcement learning to improve these models.

Result: Enhancements to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model led to better spatio-physical reasoning, outperforming leading proprietary models.

Conclusion: Though improvements were achieved, challenges in generalization to new physics scenarios remain, highlighting the need for new approaches.

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing risks posed by hyper-realistic AI-generated videos, which undermine societal trust and digital integrity, and improve benchmarks for evaluating authenticity detection models.

Method: AEGIS compiles a dataset of over 10,000 real and synthetic videos from various state-of-the-art models, includes challenging subsets for robust evaluation, and offers multimodal annotations to aid detection and related tasks.

Result: Vision-language models showed limited performance in detecting authenticity on AEGIS's most challenging subsets, underscoring the dataset's advanced realism and complexity.

Conclusion: AEGIS is a critical tool for advancing video authenticity detection research, offering a robust benchmark for developing models that can address real-world forgery threats effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

### [197] [Video-BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10774)
*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLADE, a method to accelerate video generation diffusion transformers using adaptive block-sparse attention and sparsity-aware step distillation, achieving significant speedups and quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models face inference bottlenecks due to slow denoising processes and quadratic attention costs, necessitating innovative acceleration strategies.

Method: They developed BLADE, combining Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention for content-aware computation focus and a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm for seamless integration of sparsity.

Result: BLADE achieves up to 14.10x inference acceleration with models like Wan2.1-1.3B and an 8.89x speedup for shorter sequences in CogVideoX-5B, alongside consistent improvements in video quality demonstrated by benchmark scoring and human evaluations.

Conclusion: BLADE successfully addresses inefficiencies in video generation, providing faster and higher-quality video outputs, and its implementation is publicly available for further research or application.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

*Zhenning Shi,Zizheng Yan,Yuhang Yu,Clara Xue,Jingyu Zhuang,Qi Zhang,Jinwei Chen,Tao Li,Qingnan Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TriFlowSR, a novel framework for Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) that improves alignment and detail restoration by achieving effective pattern matching between low-resolution and high-resolution images. Additionally, it provides a new dataset, Landmark-4K, for ultra-high-definition scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing diffusion-based RefSR methods that struggle with alignment between low-resolution and high-resolution images, and improve upon the low resolution and quality of existing datasets.

Method: The paper proposes TriFlowSR, a framework that explicitly performs pattern matching between the low-resolution image and reference high-resolution image using a Reference Matching Strategy. Additionally, it introduces Landmark-4K, a new ultra-high-definition RefSR dataset.

Result: TriFlowSR demonstrates superior utilization of semantic and texture information from reference images compared to existing methods. It shows effectiveness in ultra-high-definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation.

Conclusion: TriFlowSR represents a significant advancement in diffusion-based RefSR methods by improving alignment, utilizing higher-quality datasets, and achieving better restoration results. The work is further distinguished by its focus on ultra-high-definition contexts.

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

*Artem Sokolov,Mikhail Nikitin,Anton Konushin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a video-based face liveness detection method using a controlled face movement and optical flow analysis to improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of face liveness detection by addressing challenges in distinguishing real faces from presentation attacks like photos, masks, and video replays.

Method: Users are required to move their faces closer to the camera in a controlled manner, enabling neural optical flow estimation and extraction of spatial-temporal features for reliable liveness detection using a neural classifier.

Result: The method demonstrates improved capability in distinguishing genuine faces from various presentation attacks by leveraging combined optical flow and RGB frame analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves more reliable face liveness detection by utilizing a controlled movement protocol and optical flow analysis, enhancing security against presentation attacks.

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

### [200] [VasoMIM: Vascular Anatomy-Aware Masked Image Modeling for Vessel Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10794)
*De-Xing Huang,Xiao-Hu Zhou,Mei-Jiang Gui,Xiao-Liang Xie,Shi-Qi Liu,Shuang-Yi Wang,Tian-Yu Xiang,Rui-Ze Ma,Nu-Fang Xiao,Zeng-Guang Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VasoMIM, a new method for improving vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms through a self-supervised learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms are hindered by a lack of annotated data and class imbalance, prompting the need for a more tailored pre-training solution.

Method: The authors propose the VasoMIM framework, which includes an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss to improve vascular representation in masked image modeling.

Result: VasoMIM outperforms prior methods across three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in segmenting vascular structures in X-ray angiograms.

Conclusion: VasoMIM successfully leverages anatomical knowledge in self-supervised learning to enhance vessel segmentation performance, making it a valuable tool for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OF-Diff, a novel diffusion model for generating high-fidelity remote sensing images by leveraging shape priors and advanced fine-tuning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of low-fidelity image generation in remote sensing, which adversely affects object detection models.

Method: They propose OF-Diff, which incorporates prior object shapes, a dual-branch model with diffusion consistency loss, and DDPO fine-tuning for improved semantic consistency and diversity.

Result: OF-Diff significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality remote sensing images, achieving an mAP increase of 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Conclusion: The paper presents a robust solution for enhancing morphological detail and object fidelity in remote sensing image generation, making it more reliable for downstream applications.

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a significant leap in UI agent performance with UI-Venus and contributes open-source solutions and frameworks for furthering community research.

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on

50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive
data cleaning protocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving
navigation performance, which encourage further research and development in the
community. Code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/UI-Venus.

*Peng Xu,Zhiyu Xiang,Jingyun Fu,Tianyu Pu,Kai Wang,Chaojie Ji,Tingming Bai,Eryun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BaCon-Stereo, a framework for self-supervised stereo matching using a contrastive learning approach to handle both occluded and non-occluded regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised stereo matching struggles in occluded regions where the photometric consistency assumption fails.

Method: BaCon-Stereo uses a teacher-student paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, occlusion-aware attention maps, and a synthesized BaCon-20k dataset to improve stereo matching.

Result: The method enhances prediction in both occluded and non-occluded regions, showing strong generalization and robustness, and surpassing state-of-the-art methods on KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo effectively addresses the limitations in self-supervised stereo matching and performs better than existing methods. Code and data will be shared after acceptance.

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance federated learning by refining personalization and scalability while addressing non-IID and cross-domain challenges.

Method: Introduces focal modulation with task-aware embeddings, low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, and extended validation.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over baselines across diverse datasets and federated setups, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposes a more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable framework for transformer-based FL, extending its capabilities.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: PhysHPO introduces a novel framework to improve the physical realism and quality of generated videos through preference optimization at multiple hierarchical levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating physically plausible videos for applications requiring realism and accuracy.

Method: The PhysHPO framework uses Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization to align video generation at four granular levels and employs an automated data selection pipeline to enhance the training dataset.

Result: The model demonstrates significant improvements in physical plausibility and overall video generation quality in physics-focused and general capability benchmarks.

Conclusion: PhysHPO sets a new precedent in fine-grained preference optimization and data selection for realistic video generation, contributing to human-preferred video creation paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

Motivation: To improve differentiation of brain tumor types using MRI for better treatment planning in neuro-oncology by leveraging advancements in large language models.

Method: Used a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark with MRI triplanar mosaics and structured clinical data. Assessed GPT models (GPT-4o and GPT-5 variants) in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy in visual and reasoning tasks.

Result: GPT-5-mini had the highest macro-average accuracy at 44.19%, followed by GPT-5 at 43.71%, GPT-4o at 41.49%, and GPT-5-nano at 35.85%. Performance differed across tumor subtypes.

Conclusion: While GPT-5 family models show moderate accuracy in neuro-oncological tasks, they are not accurate enough for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

*Yushi Lan,Yihang Luo,Fangzhou Hong,Shangchen Zhou,Honghua Chen,Zhaoyang Lyu,Shuai Yang,Bo Dai,Chen Change Loy,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R introduces a Transformer-based streaming system for efficient 3D reconstruction using causal attention, outperforming prior methods in both static and dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and limitations of existing multi-view 3D reconstruction methods, especially in dynamic scenes and long sequences.

Method: STream3R adopts a decoder-only Transformer architecture with causal attention, leveraging geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets for better generalization.

Result: Experiments show STream3R’s superior performance over previous methods in both static and dynamic benchmarks.

Conclusion: STream3R demonstrates the promise of causal Transformer models in online and real-time 3D reconstruction, suggesting applications in dynamic and streaming scenarios.

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAESTRO, an adapted Masked Autoencoder optimized for Earth observation data with improved fusion strategies and spectral priors, achieving state-of-the-art results on dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of applying self-supervised learning to Earth observation data, considering its multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral nature.

Method: The authors benchmark fusion strategies and normalization schemes specific to Earth observation data, and propose MAESTRO, a Masked Autoencoder variant with a spectral prior self-supervisory signal.

Result: MAESTRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on Earth observation tasks with multitemporal dynamics and remains competitive on single mono-temporal modality tasks.

Conclusion: The tailored features of MAESTRO demonstrate the effectiveness of adapting foundational models for remote sensing applications, paving the way for improved self-supervised learning in Earth observation.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

### [213] [ESSENTIAL: Episodic and Semantic Memory Integration for Video Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10896)
*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL addresses the video class-incremental learning (VCIL) challenge by combining sparse and semantic memories for better efficiency and performance, validated on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCIL methods either require dense memory samples, which are memory-inefficient, or sparse samples that compromise temporal info, necessitating better trade-offs.

Method: ESSENTIAL utilizes episodic memory for sparse storage and semantic memory for general knowledge integration via learnable prompts, supported by a novel Memory Retrieval module.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates ESSENTIAL outperforms benchmarks using significantly reduced memory on datasets like UCF-101, HMDB51, and others.

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL ensures superior VCIL performance by effectively retrieving dense temporal features from sparse data while being memory-efficient.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiC, a unified 3D human motion model that generalizes across domains, tasks, and datasets by combining pose and mesh representations and using advanced sampling and architecture strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for cross-domain 3D human motion often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage training, which limits their scalability and practicality.

Method: The authors propose a new framework, HiC, which incorporates pose and mesh representations, a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy, and a dual-branch context injection network architecture for better generalization and contextual handling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that HiC outperforms the earlier PiC model in generalization, data scale, and performance across diverse domains.

Conclusion: HiC showcases significant potential in creating a scalable and flexible unified cross-domain 3D human motion model, addressing limitations of earlier approaches.

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puppeteer is a framework that automates 3D model rigging and animation using advanced AI techniques, tackling bottlenecks in content creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformation of static 3D models into animated assets is a bottleneck in modern interactive applications. Rigging and animation processes require significant expert intervention, despite advancements in generating static 3D models.

Method: Puppeteer uses an auto-regressive transformer with joint-based tokenization and hierarchical ordering for skeletal prediction, attention-based architectures for skinning, and a differentiable optimization pipeline for animation.

Result: Puppeteer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skeletal prediction accuracy, skinning quality, and animation stability across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework automates rigging and animation, efficiently handling diverse 3D content to produce jitter-free, high-quality animations, making it a robust solution for modern content creation.

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum Visual Field (QVF), a new type of Quantum Implicit Neural Representation (QINR), which improves performance in 2D and 3D visual tasks using a novel quantum computing approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in the architecture, training efficiency, and interplay with classical components of existing QINRs and to leverage quantum computing for enhanced performance in visual representation tasks.

Method: The method involves designing QVF, which encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural amplitude encoding and a fully entangled ansatz with parameterized quantum circuits. It enables direct projective measurements and avoids classical post-processing.

Result: The paper demonstrates that QVF outperforms prior QINR approaches and classical methods in terms of visual representation accuracy, high-frequency detail learning, and other metrics on quantum hardware simulators.

Conclusion: QVF showcases the utility of quantum computing for visual data tasks with applications in 2D/3D field completion and shape interpolation, marking a significant advance in QINRs.

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ShellFT introduces a framework to enhance flexibility in hybrid fault-tolerant systems while reducing diversification costs by over 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid fault models lack flexibility in fault-tolerant component composition and incur high diversification overhead, limiting their applicability.

Method: ShellFT uses micro replication to selectively hybridize replication logic, allowing customization based on Byzantine fault resiliency requirements.

Result: ShellFT demonstrates significant cost reductions (over 70%) in system diversification while maintaining robustness compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The ShellFT framework provides tailored, efficient solutions for hybrid fault tolerance in consensus-based systems, addressing prior limitations in flexibility and cost.

Abstract: Hybrid fault models are known to be an effective means for enhancing the
robustness of consensus-based replicated systems. However, existing
hybridization approaches suffer from limited flexibility with regard to the
composition of crash-tolerant and Byzantine fault-tolerant system parts and/or
are associated with a significant diversification overhead. In this paper we
address these issues with ShellFT, a framework that leverages the concept of
micro replication to allow system designers to freely choose the parts of the
replication logic that need to be resilient against Byzantine faults. As a key
benefit, such a selective hybridization makes it possible to develop hybrid
solutions that are tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of
individual use cases. To illustrate this flexibility, we present three custom
ShellFT protocols and analyze the complexity of their implementations. Our
evaluation shows that compared with traditional hybridization approaches,
ShellFT is able to decrease diversification costs by more than 70%.

Abstract: The hardware diversity displayed in leadership-class computing facilities,
alongside the immense performance boosts exhibited by today's GPUs when

models. We present an on-the-fly framework using Hipify for performance
portability and apply it to FFTMatvec-an HPC application that computes
matrix-vector products with block-triangular Toeplitz matrices. Our approach
enables FFTMatvec, initially a CUDA-only application, to run seamlessly on AMD
GPUs with excellent observed performance. Performance optimizations for AMD
GPUs are integrated directly into the open-source rocBLAS library, keeping the
application code unchanged. We then present a dynamic mixed-precision framework
for FFTMatvec; a Pareto front analysis determines the optimal mixed-precision
configuration for a desired error tolerance. Results are shown for AMD Instinct
MI250X, MI300X, and the newly launched MI355X GPUs. The performance-portable,
mixed-precision FFTMatvec is scaled to 2,048 GPUs on the OLCF Frontier
supercomputer.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenFPL, an open-source method for forecasting Fantasy Premier League player performance, using public data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate performance predictions benefit participants in Fantasy Premier League, but current offerings are mostly commercial and undisclosed.

Method: The study uses position-specific ensemble models built on public Fantasy Premier League and Understat data from four seasons.

Result: OpenFPL achieves accuracy comparable to commercial services and even surpasses them in predicting high-return players.

Conclusion: OpenFPL democratizes access to accurate player forecasts and supports both short-term and long-term Fantasy Premier League strategies.

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve inference for tabular data, where traditional methods like GBDTs remain dominant despite advances in AI, and to explore state-of-the-art neural network approaches.

Method: xRFM combines feature learning with kernel machines and tree structures to adapt to data's local structure and scale for large datasets.

Result: xRFM outperforms 31 methods, including GBDTs and TabPFNv2, across 100 regression datasets and is highly competitive across 200 classification datasets. It also provides native interpretability.

Conclusion: xRFM is a state-of-the-art algorithm for tabular data, advancing performance and interpretability beyond GBDTs and other recent methods.

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

TL;DR: This study tested a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm to improve physical activity using personalized nudges via a Fitbit app, showing significant gains in daily step counts in the RL group.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global challenge of physical inactivity and evaluate scalable, personalized interventions leveraging mobile health technologies.

Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 13,463 Fitbit users across four arms: control (no nudges), random nudges, fixed nudges, and reinforcement learning algorithm delivering personalized nudges.

Result: The RL group demonstrated a significant increase in average daily step count compared to control, random, and fixed groups, with sustained improvements observed over 2 months.

Conclusion: Behaviorally-informed reinforcement learning algorithms can effectively personalize mobile interventions to promote greater physical activity at scale.

Abstract: Consistent physical inactivity poses a major global health challenge. Mobile
health (mHealth) interventions, particularly Just-in-Time Adaptive
Interventions (JITAIs), offer a promising avenue for scalable, personalized
physical activity (PA) promotion. However, developing and evaluating such
interventions at scale, while integrating robust behavioral science, presents
methodological hurdles. The PEARL study was the first large-scale, four-arm
randomized controlled trial to assess a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm,
informed by health behavior change theory, to personalize the content and
timing of PA nudges via a Fitbit app.
  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

### [227] [Measuring Time Series Forecast Stability for Demand Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10063)
*Steven Klee,Yuntian Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper highlights how demand planners in supply chains value forecast stability over incremental accuracy improvements, proposing model stability as a key consideration alongside accuracy. Ensemble models were found to enhance stability without harming forecast accuracy in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the demand planners' preference for stable and consistent forecasts, as unstable forecasts require significant human intervention and lead to reduced trust in machine learning models.

Method: The researchers conducted a case study comparing the stability and accuracy of several state-of-the-art forecasting models using public datasets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. They also measured model-induced stochasticity to quantify stability.

Result: Ensemble models were found to improve forecast stability without significantly deteriorating, and sometimes even improving, forecast accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to focus on forecast stability, not just accuracy, for models deployed in production systems and calls for more research in this area.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

### [228] [Constrained Decoding of Diffusion LLMs with Context-Free Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10111)
*Niels Mündler,Jasper Dekoninck,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of constrained decoding for diffusion-based language models (LLMs) to ensure that their output adheres to syntactic constraints of formal languages, such as C++ and JSON.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to produce syntactically valid outputs for formal languages due to their probabilistic nature, posing issues for tasks like code infilling or structured data extraction.

Method: The authors propose a method reducing constrained decoding to a general additive infilling problem, which is further reduced to checking the intersection of a target formal language (context-free) with a regular language. They provide an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, optimizing computational overhead.

Result: The proposed method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness across applications such as C++ code infilling and JSON data extraction. It also consistently either preserves or improves the outputs' functional correctness while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the first constrained decoding method for diffusion LLMs when generating for formal languages, demonstrating that the proposed approach is both effective in maintaining syntactic and functional correctness and computationally practical.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

*Sola Shirai,Kavitha Srinivas,Julian Dolby,Michael Katz,Horst Samulowitz,Shirin Sohrabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the capability of large language models (LLMs) to solve graph reasoning tasks without relying on specialized graph encoding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate whether LLMs can handle graph reasoning tasks effectively and generalize their learning without requiring specialized methods like graph neural networks (GNNs) or graph encoding models.

Method: The authors empirically analyzed LLM performance by training them with instructive chain-of-thought solutions and testing their generalization to new graph tasks and unseen structures.

Result: The study demonstrates that even small LLMs can solve graph tasks and generalize their learning to unseen tasks and graph structures without the need for specialized graph encoders.

Conclusion: LLMs can simplify graph reasoning tasks and exhibit strong generalization capabilities, providing a promising avenue for solving graph-related problems using a simpler approach.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

*Ke Niu,Haiyang Yu,Zhuofan Chen,Mengyang Zhao,Teng Fu,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAD-RL, a framework leveraging multimodal Chain-of-Thought guided reinforcement learning to improve automated CAD code generation from natural language inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAD workflows require significant domain expertise and manual effort, posing challenges to automating the process effectively with large language models.

Method: CAD-RL uses Chain-of-Thought Cold Start followed by reinforcement learning with three rewards for executability, geometric accuracy, and external evaluation. It integrates optimization strategies like Trust Region Stretch, Precision Token Loss, and Overlong Filtering.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved reasoning abilities, precision in parametric modeling, and better code executability compared to existing models.

Conclusion: CAD-RL offers a promising step toward automating parametric CAD modeling, significantly improving reasoning and execution capabilities through advanced reinforcement learning techniques combined with a novel dataset, ExeCAD.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

*Maxime Heuillet,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Audrey Durand,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nested-ReFT improves computational efficiency in reinforced fine-tuning for mathematical reasoning by leveraging dynamic in-model completions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical reasoning via LLMs requires reinforcement learning frameworks, but the computational cost of generating multiple completions during training is high.

Method: Nested-ReFT uses a subset of the model’s layers to act as the behavior model, reducing inference costs through dynamic layer skipping and off-policy completion generation.

Result: Theoretical analysis confirms unbiased gradient estimates while empirical results show improved token processing speed across benchmarks and model sizes.

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT retains performance quality of standard ReFT while significantly improving computational efficiency for demanding reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

### [232] [Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228)
*Abdelmoula El Yazizi,Samee U. Khan,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the sampling quality of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) using data from Gibbs sampling and the D-Wave quantum annealer. The comparison reveals that the sampling techniques differ in their ability to explore local energy valleys (LVs), impacting RBM trainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to understand the effectiveness of using quantum annealing techniques (via D-Wave) in sampling from RBMs—a key step in machine learning—compared to classical Gibbs sampling approaches.

Method: The authors compared samples from a D-Wave quantum annealer with Gibbs sampling on RBMs trained classically. They assessed the number of local valleys (LVs) captured and the energy levels of corresponding local minima under different conditions and training epochs.

Result: D-Wave sampling did not significantly increase the number of local valleys captured as annealing time decreased. At any training epoch, D-Wave found somewhat more LVs than Gibbs sampling, but many important intermediate-probability LVs were uniquely discovered by one method and not the other. Overlap between techniques reduced in later training stages.

Conclusion: The study concluded that the D-Wave technique offered modest improvements in specific scenarios but fell short of a clear advantage over classical methods. A combined classical-quantum sampling approach may hold promise for RBM trainability.

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

### [233] [EDAPT: Towards Calibration-Free BCIs with Continual Online Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10474)
*Lisa Haxel,Jaivardhan Kapoor,Ulf Ziemann,Jakob H. Macke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDAPT is a framework for calibration-free, continually adaptive BCIs that improves accuracy using population-level pretraining and continual personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs face challenges of accuracy degradation due to neural signal drift and user variability, demanding frequent recalibration that limits their practical use.

Method: EDAPT initially trains a baseline decoder with multi-user data and then continually personalizes the model using supervised finetuning during use. It also leverages unsupervised domain adaptation in some cases.

Result: Tests on nine datasets spanning three BCI tasks showed EDAPT consistently improved accuracy over static models, updating efficiently within 200 milliseconds.

Conclusion: EDAPT enables calibration-free BCIs, addressing a key deployment barrier, and ensures decoding accuracy scales with the data budget rather than allocation specifics.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

*Yuhan Xie,William Cappelletti,Mahsa Shoaran,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy for time series classification, improving performance by enforcing Neural Collapse and incorporating generative tasks and sequential augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series classifiers need sophisticated temporal pattern representation, but current pre-training strategies rely on heuristics and lack robust transferability.

Method: The method uses a rotational equiangular tight frame-classifier with pseudo-labeling for pre-training deep encoders, incorporating generative tasks and unique sequential augmentation to enhance temporal embedding separability.

Result: The approach outperforms standard pretext tasks across LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time series classification datasets.

Conclusion: Aligning pre-training strategies with theoretical principles like embedding geometry significantly boosts classification outcomes in time-series models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a post-hoc Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method leveraging counterfactual explanations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safety in machine learning by improving the accuracy and explainability of OOD detection methods.

Method: The method computes distances to decision boundaries using counterfactual explanations, enhances scalability by working in embedding space, and uses these explanations for interpretability.

Result: Achieves 93.50% AUROC and 25.80% FPR95 on CIFAR-10, 97.05% AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 on CIFAR-100, and 92.55% AUROC with 33.55% FPR95 for ImageNet-200 across OOD datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively combines strong OOD detection performance with explainability, outperforming existing approaches in several benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

### [236] [Uncertainty-Aware Prediction of Parkinson's Disease Medication Needs: A Two-Stage Conformal Prediction Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10284)
*Ricardo Diaz-Rincon,Muxuan Liang,Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora,Benjamin Shickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conformal prediction framework to improve Parkinson's disease medication management by forecasting future levodopa dosage needs with quantified uncertainty, optimizing symptom control and minimizing side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medication management in Parkinson's Disease is challenging due to variable disease progression and treatment responses, requiring predictive methods to replace current trial-and-error approaches.

Method: The authors developed a conformal prediction framework that anticipates medication adjustments up to two years ahead with reliable prediction intervals, leveraging electronic health records to address zero-inflation data effectively.

Result: The framework achieved statistical reliability while providing shorter prediction intervals for near-term forecasts and broader intervals for long-term needs, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: Quantified uncertainties in medication predictions enable clinicians to make evidence-based dosing decisions, balancing symptom control and side effects to enhance patients' quality of life.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the behavior of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm under model misspecification for overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression, providing convergence rates at both population and finite-sample levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address model misspecification challenges and understand the EM algorithm's efficiency in overspecified scenarios, particularly focusing on convergence behavior with varying mixing weight conditions.

Method: The paper uses theoretical analysis to establish convergence rates of the EM algorithm for two different initial mixing weight assumptions, analyzing population-level behavior and connecting to finite-sample accuracy results.

Result: For unbalanced mixing weights, linear convergence with $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ steps is achieved at the population level, whereas balanced weights show sublinear convergence with $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps. At the finite-sample level, accuracy scales as $O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for unbalanced weights and $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ for balanced weights.

Conclusion: The findings suggest iteration complexity bounds that connect population-level results with finite-sample performance, highlighting implications for improving the efficiency of mixture model applications in overspecified setups.

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

*Petr Spelda,Vit Stritecky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes how impactful benchmarks can play a crucial role in selecting and improving reasoning language models, influencing their learning rather than relying solely on algorithmic improvements or model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With reasoning becoming an essential aspect of scaling language models, the paper aims to explore the role of impactful benchmarks as a curriculum for improving generalization capability rather than solely utilizing them as test sets.

Method: The study investigates the DeepSeek-R1 model via sequential decision-making tasks from Humanity's Last Exam, analyzing performance improvements driven by benchmark-driven selection and curriculum design.

Result: It demonstrates that impactful benchmarks influence AI development effectively, acting as training curricula and enhancing generalization capabilities for reasoning models.

Conclusion: Using benchmarks not just for evaluation but also as training curricula can guide the development of reasoning language models, making task novelty vital for assessing generalization.

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the implicit regularization behavior of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) in tensorized and scale-invariant models by analyzing norm dynamics. It introduces a novel method, Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS), for improved performance with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit regularization effects of SAM beyond simple settings and apply this understanding to improve optimization techniques in tensorized models.

Method: The authors analyze SAM's norm dynamics using gradient flow analysis, introduce the concept of Norm Deviation, and propose the Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS) method, which adapts core norm scaling based on data.

Result: DAS provides competitive or better performance than SAM in tasks like tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and fine-tuning, while requiring less computational effort.

Conclusion: The proposed DAS leverages insights from SAM's behavior for effective regularization, enhancing both performance and efficiency in various machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Rahul Janaa,Shubham Dixit,Mrityunjay Sharma,Ritesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of tracking cattle health and behavior in dairy farming using explainable machine learning (ML) methods combined with IoT devices and 4G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve monitoring of dairy cattle health and optimize farming practices through modern data-driven and explainable ML methodologies.

Method: The study collects and processes 3-axis accelerometer data using Bluetooth IoT devices, analyzes it with various hyperparameter-optimized ML models, and emphasizes explainability through frameworks like SHAP.

Result: The k-nearest neighbor classifier delivered the best activity classification performance with an AUC of 0.98 for training and 0.99 for testing. Stability and feature importance analyses were also performed.

Conclusion: The proposed ML framework provides not only accurate but also interpretable insights into cattle behavior, aiding farmers in adopting more sustainable and informed livestock management practices.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

*Will Fein,Ryan J. Horwitz,John E. Brown III,Amit Misra,Felipe Oviedo,Kevin White,Juan M. Lavista Ferres,Samuel K. Wasser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-based handwriting analysis on ivory tusks reveals connections between seizures, aiding forensic investigations into elephant trafficking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ongoing transnational ivory trade threatens elephant populations in Africa, and traditional investigative methods are limited by cost and availability of genetic evidence.

Method: Developed an AI-driven pipeline to analyze 6,085 photographs of seized ivory tusks (2014-2019), identifying and clustering 17,000+ handwritten markings to detect repetitive patterns and links between seizures.

Result: Identified 184 recurring signature markings, 20 of which were observed across multiple seizures, establishing forensic connections between shipments.

Conclusion: AI handwriting analysis offers a low-cost and scalable forensic tool that complements existing methods like DNA analysis in combating wildlife crime.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

*Alexander Merkov,David Rohde,Alexandre Gilotte,Benjamin Heymann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights how standard practices like feature engineering and A/B testing can introduce confounding bias in recommendation systems, reducing their effectiveness. Simulations demonstrate these issues and practical solutions are proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating unobserved confounding is essential for accurately assessing causal effects in observational studies, including in recommendation systems where common practices can inadvertently introduce bias.

Method: The paper explores how standard recommender system practices can lead to confounding through theoretical analysis and simulation studies, and offers actionable strategies to counteract these effects.

Result: Simulation studies showcase how practices like modularization and A/B testing introduce confounding bias, degrading recommendation performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners should critically evaluate their strategies in recommendation systems to minimize confounding effects, enabling improved system performance and reliability.

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

*Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Junyi Fan,Yong Si,Minoo Ahmadi,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning model for early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) in ICU patients with cirrhosis, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly worsens outcomes in cirrhosis patients, and existing predictive tools lack accuracy and adaptability in ICU settings. This paper aims to address this gap with a novel solution.

Method: The study conducted a retrospective analysis using the MIMIC-IV database, preprocessing data, applying feature selection, and training various machine learning algorithms (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost) for AKI prediction.

Result: The most effective algorithm, LightGBM, achieved AUROC 0.808 and identified actionable predictors like pH and pO2 changes, aiding in early risk stratification.

Conclusion: The model offers accurate, interpretable AKI predictions using routine clinical data, facilitating safe de-escalation strategies and clinician trust. External validation and EHR integration are recommended.

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

### [244] [Can Transformers Break Encryption Schemes via In-Context Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10235)
*Jathin Korrapati,Patrick Mendoza,Aditya Tomar,Abein Abraham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates using in-context learning (ICL) with transformer-based language models to decode cryptographic ciphers (e.g., substitution and Vigenère ciphers) by conditioning on small text pairs without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore and extend the application of in-context learning capabilities of transformers from conventional structured functions (e.g., mathematical models) to more complex cryptographic function inference.

Method: The authors utilize a transformer-based model to decode encryption schemes, including mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigenère ciphers, by providing it with a few example (cipher text, plain text) pairs and evaluating its inference capability.

Result: The research demonstrates that transformers can infer underlying cryptographic mappings and decode new cipher text purely through examples supplied at inference time.

Conclusion: This work illustrates the potential of transformers in cryptographic function learning and provides insight into their inductive biases and generalization under the ICL paradigm.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Masked Diffusion Neural Sampler (MDNS) for generating samples from complex discrete state spaces, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of sampling from discrete state spaces with high cardinality and multimodal distributions is critical in areas like statistical physics and machine learning but remains challenging.

Method: The authors introduce the Masked Diffusion Neural Sampler (MDNS), a framework based on aligning path measures using learning objectives grounded in stochastic optimal control for continuous-time Markov chains.

Result: MDNS demonstrates the ability to accurately sample from complex target distributions across various experiments, outperforming existing learning-based methods.

Conclusion: MDNS proves to be an efficient and scalable solution for high-dimensional discrete sampling tasks, with potential for broader applications as demonstrated through experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from
discrete state spaces where the target probability mass function
$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, etc. To better address this challenging task when
the state space has a large cardinality and the distribution is multi-modal, we
propose $\textbf{M}$asked $\textbf{D}$iffusion $\textbf{N}$eural
$\textbf{S}$ampler ($\textbf{MDNS}$), a novel framework for training discrete
neural samplers by aligning two path measures through a family of learning
objectives, theoretically grounded in the stochastic optimal control of the
continuous-time Markov chains. We validate the efficiency and scalability of
MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

*Taibiao Zhao,Mingxuan Sun,Hao Wang,Xiaobing Chen,Xiangwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HPMI, a novel backdoor attack on transformer models that requires no retraining or architecture alteration, achieving high attack success and stealth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models dominate CV and NLP tasks but are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack methods are resource-intensive, making it essential to develop a non-intrusive, efficient attack.

Method: The proposed HPMI prunes the least important head of a transformer and injects a pre-trained malicious head, requiring only minimal data and no model retraining or architecture changes.

Result: HPMI achieves negligible clean accuracy loss, a high attack success rate of at least 99.55%, and bypasses four state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. It also offers higher robustness and concealment compared to retraining-based attacks.

Conclusion: HPMI represents a significant evolution in backdoor attacks by being effective, resource-efficient, and stealthy, posing challenges for existing defense strategies.

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

### [247] [Enhancing Fairness in Autoencoders for Node-Level Graph Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10785)
*Shouju Wang,Yuchen Song,Sheng'en Li,Dongmian Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on addressing fairness in graph anomaly detection (GAD) using a novel framework called DECAF-GAD, which improves anomaly detection performance and fairness simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph anomaly detection has become prevalent with the advancement of GNNs, but fairness remains an underexplored area as models may inherit and amplify biases from training data.

Method: The authors propose DECAF-GAD, leveraging structural causal models (SCM) to disentangle sensitive attributes and developing a specialized autoencoder architecture with a fairness-guided loss function.

Result: DECAF-GAD outperforms baseline methods in both anomaly detection performance and fairness metrics across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD is a robust solution for fair graph anomaly detection, balancing high performance and reduced bias.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance function approximation by leveraging exponential neural network operators and understanding their convergence properties in various settings.

Method: The study introduces Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators and evaluates their approximation properties through pointwise and uniform convergence analyses, along with convergence in the Orlicz space.

Result: The paper successfully derives convergence rates using the logarithmic modulus of continuity and offers graphical proofs showing the approximation error for specific kernels and activation functions.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the efficiency and reliability of the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators in function approximation, showcasing their potential in various analytical settings.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating
functions using exponential neural network operators. We extend this framework
to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPs, despite their strength in regression and uncertainty quantification, face computational challenges with large or streaming datasets. Addressing redundancy and budget constraints could expand their applicability.

Method: The paper conducts a unified comparison of reduction criteria along with proposing acceptance criteria, testing them on benchmark and real-world datasets to assess their efficiency in reducing redundant datapoints.

Result: The evaluation highlights performance differences across various reduction criteria, and the proposed acceptance criteria further optimize the reduction process, demonstrating improved efficiency in streaming scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidelines for selecting reduction and acceptance criteria, potentially improving the usability of online GPs in dynamic and streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based resource orchestration method for cloud-native databases to tackle scheduling and dynamism issues, showcasing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and complexity in cloud-native database systems' scheduling, which traditional methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: The method involves a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach using heterogeneous role-based agents, a reward-shaping mechanism for better coordination, and a unified multi-agent training framework.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrated superior performance in metrics like utilization, latency, convergence speed, and fairness when compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and practical for handling large-scale, complex scheduling environments in cloud-native database systems, ensuring better system efficiency and stability.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, such as data privacy, resource heterogeneity, and centralized modeling inefficiencies.

Method: The method uses federated learning with local training by tenants, parameter aggregation for a global model, personalized parameter adjustment, and anomaly scores based on Mahalanobis distance for accuracy.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness and superior accuracy compared to mainstream models, even under variable participation and noise.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective for resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in complex cloud environments, outperforming conventional methods in metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for adapting predictions to data streams experiencing source component shifts, significantly improving performance by combining offline modeling and online adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing methods for adapting predictions with recurring source component shifts in data streams.

Method: The method involves offline decomposition using the EM algorithm to model individual source components and online convex optimization to adapt mixing weights for predictions.

Result: Empirical results show that the proposed approach reduces cumulative test loss by up to 67.4% on real-world regression datasets, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively leverages source component characteristics, offering superior adaptive prediction capabilities in dynamic data environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynBrain addresses the challenge of modeling visual-to-neural mapping by introducing a probabilistic, biologically interpretable framework with components designed for neural response simulations and visual semantic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the transformation of visual stimuli into cortical responses is challenging due to biological variability, which deterministic methods fail to model while maintaining functional consistency.

Method: The paper proposes SynBrain, which includes BrainVAE for probabilistic modeling of neural representations and a Semantic-to-Neural Mapper for projecting visual semantics into neural response manifolds.

Result: SynBrain outperformed state-of-the-art methods in visual-to-fMRI encoding, adapted efficiently to new subjects, synthesized high-quality fMRI signals, and captured biologically interpretable patterns.

Conclusion: SynBrain establishes a probabilistic framework that not only improves encoding performance and decoding, but also reveals functional consistency and biological variability in neural responses.

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will

### [254] [Improving Learning of New Diseases through Knowledge-Enhanced Initialization for Federated Adapter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10299)
*Danni Peng,Yuan Wang,Kangning Cai,Peiyan Ning,Jiming Xu,Yong Liu,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Qingsong Wei,Huazhu Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedKEI, a framework to improve task adaptation in Federated Learning for healthcare by leveraging past knowledge through a clustering approach and a bi-level optimization process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective and fast adaptation for clients in a rapidly changing healthcare environment while preserving privacy, especially in cases involving new diseases or tasks.

Method: The proposed method, FedKEI, starts with global clustering to generalize task knowledge, followed by optimization of intra- and inter-cluster weights and a bi-level optimization scheme to personalize transfer learning for each client's task objectives.

Result: FedKEI demonstrates superior adaptability to new diseases compared to existing methods, validated on three healthcare datasets spanning dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT imaging.

Conclusion: FedKEI effectively enhances Federated Learning by integrating cross-client and cross-task knowledge transfer, facilitating better task adaptation in the healthcare domain.

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [255] [A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315)
*Keke Gai,Dongjue Wang,Jing Yu,Liehuang Zhu,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLIP-Fed, a framework for defending against backdoor attacks in federated learning under heterogeneous client data settings using vision-language models like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FL backdoor defense methods often assume homogeneous data distributions or require a server-side clean dataset, limiting practicality when data is diverse.

Method: CLIP-Fed uses zero-shot learning from vision-language models and combines pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies. It constructs an augmented server dataset without client samples, mitigates deviations/prototypes using contrastive loss and KL divergence alignment.

Result: CLIP-Fed reduces attack success rates (ASR) by 2.03% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35% on CIFAR-10-LT while improving model performance by 7.92% and 0.48%, respectively.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed effectively mitigates backdoor attacks even under heterogeneous data distributions, with improved robustness and model accuracy compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

### [256] [Welfare-Centric Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10345)
*Claire Jie Zhang,Seyed A. Esmaeili,Jamie Morgenstern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces welfare-centric clustering objectives and algorithms, showing theoretical and empirical benefits over fair clustering baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional fairness notions in clustering, which may lead to unintended outcomes and advocate a welfare-centric approach.

Method: Two welfare-centric objectives based on distance and proportional representation were formulated: Rawlsian and Utilitarian. Novel algorithms were devised and analyzed theoretically.

Result: The proposed methods significantly outperformed existing fair clustering baselines across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Welfare-centric clustering offers a promising alternative to traditional fairness-focused clustering methods, improving group utilities.

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

### [257] [A Hierarchical IDS for Zero-Day Attack Detection in Internet of Medical Things Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10346)
*Md Ashraf Uddin,Nam H. Chu,Reza Rafeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-level Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework to secure Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks against cyberattacks, achieving high accuracy and strong applicability for zero-day threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the security challenges of IoMT systems, which are resource-constrained and vulnerable to cyberattacks. Traditional centralized IDSs cannot meet the requirements of IoMT due to response delays, privacy risks, and inefficiency in dense environments.

Method: The authors propose a multi-level IDS framework for IoMT. The first layer near the edge uses meta-learning or One-Class Classification (OCC) to coarsely filter traffic as attack or not. Further layers (far Edge and Cloud) identify the type and novelty of the attack. Experiments were conducted on the CICIoMT2024 dataset to validate performance.

Result: The proposed IDS framework demonstrates 99.77% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score in experiments. Additionally, the first layer efficiently detects zero-day attacks using meta-learning without requiring new datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-level IDS framework showcases excellent accuracy and detection capabilities, making it highly applicable for securing IoMT environments against advanced and zero-day cyber threats.

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

*Samer Lahoud,Kinda Khawam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses a paradigm shift in communication focusing on conveying semantic meaning instead of bit-perfect reproduction. It investigates learning meaning distribution through sequential observations and explores theoretical conditions for effective learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional communication by introducing semantic communication systems that infer meaning distribution, especially when priors are unavailable.

Method: The researchers establish conditions like the full rank of the transmission matrix for effective learning, analyze convergence rates, and quantify distortions caused by estimation errors.

Result: They proved the trade-off between immediate semantic performance and long-term learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate their theory, linking system conditioning to learning rates and overall performance.

Conclusion: The study offers foundational insights into statistical learning in semantic communication and provides design principles for balancing short-term performance and adaptive capabilities.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

### [259] [eMamba: Efficient Acceleration Framework for Mamba Models in Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10370)
*Jiyong Kim,Jaeho Lee,Jiahao Lin,Alish Kanani,Miao Sun,Umit Y. Ogras,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: eMamba introduces a hardware acceleration framework tailored for Mamba models on edge devices, offering impressive efficiency gains in computational metrics while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of optimized hardware acceleration frameworks for deploying computationally efficient Mamba models on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: eMamba integrates lightweight hardware-aware alternatives, approximates complex operations, applies approximation-aware NAS for parameter tuning, and implements the pipeline on FPGA and ASIC platforms.

Result: Evaluations on datasets like Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MARS show up to 19.9x fewer parameters, with significantly improved latency, throughput, power, energy efficiency, and area compared to baseline solutions.

Conclusion: eMamba demonstrates the potential to combine hardware efficiency with competitive accuracy, offering a viable solution for deploying SSM models in edge environments.

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

### [260] [A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393)
*Liyun Zhang,Jingcheng Ke,Shenli Fan,Xuanmeng Sha,Zheng Lian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework with novel metrics to evaluate how well individual annotator tendencies are captured and explained in multi-annotator learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of an evaluation framework to assess if Individual Tendency Learning methods truly capture annotator-specific labeling patterns and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.

Method: The authors propose a unified evaluation framework with two new metrics: Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) and Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE). These quantify model performance concerning annotator consistency and behavioral alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm the proposed evaluation framework's effectiveness in assessing annotator-specific behaviors and explainability of decisions.

Conclusion: This framework contributes to advancements in evaluating ITL methods, ensuring models better capture individual annotator behaviors and provide insightful explanations.

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

### [261] [XQuant: Breaking the Memory Wall for LLM Inference with KV Cache Rematerialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10395)
*Aditya Tomar,Coleman Hooper,Minjae Lee,Haocheng Xi,Rishabh Tiwari,Wonjun Kang,Luca Manolache,Michael W. Mahoney,Kurt Keutzer,Amir Gholami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces XQuant, a method that uses low-bit quantization to significantly reduce memory consumption during LLM inference, without substantial accuracy loss, by rematerializing Keys and Values dynamically instead of relying on standard KV caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compute capabilities have advanced faster than memory capacity and bandwidth, making LLM inference challenging due to its high memory and bandwidth demands. The paper seeks to address this imbalance by leveraging compute advancements to optimize memory usage.

Method: The authors propose XQuant, which quantizes layer input activations rather than caching KV pairs, allowing on-the-fly rematerialization. They also introduce XQuant-CL, exploiting cross-layer similarity for further memory savings.

Result: XQuant reduces memory usage by up to 7.7x with less than 0.1 perplexity degradation, and XQuant-CL achieves up to 12.5x memory savings with only a small accuracy impact.

Conclusion: By leveraging increased computational capacity to manage memory demands, XQuant offers a more memory-efficient alternative to KV caching while maintaining near-original accuracy, addressing a key bottleneck in LLM inference.

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

*Pengbo Shen,Yaqing Wang,Ni Mu,Yao Luan,Runpeng Xie,Senhao Yang,Lexiang Wang,Hao Hu,Shuang Xu,Yiqin Yang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SC2Arena and StarEvolve as advanced systems for analyzing and improving large language models' (LLMs) ability in strategic and tactical gameplay, particularly in StarCraft II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for complex decision-making lack the ability to capture the full complexity of a game like StarCraft II, which includes diverse action spaces, full game context, and playable races.

Method: The authors developed SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports playable races, action spaces, and optimized text-based observations. They also created StarEvolve, a hierarchical framework featuring a Planner-Executor-Verifier structure and a scoring system for self-correction and improvement.

Result: Experiments show that StarEvolve improves performance in strategic planning, providing new insights into creating generalist agents. Comprehensive analysis of SC2Arena surfaces areas previously unexplored with prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: SC2Arena and StarEvolve advance the evaluation of LLMs in strategic planning and decision-making tasks, validating their effectiveness in enhancing gameplay agents for complex environments like StarCraft II.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces RealAC, a framework that generates realistic and actionable counterfactual explanations by preserving data interdependencies and respecting user constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations often fail to respect data distributions or user constraints, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: RealAC aligns feature distributions between factual and counterfactual instances to preserve dependencies and enables user-defined constraints, like freezing certain features during optimization.

Result: RealAC demonstrated excellence across multiple metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based methods.

Conclusion: RealAC provides a domain-agnostic, causality-aware solution for generating user-centric counterfactual explanations that balance realism and feasibility.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

*Prajit Sengupta,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve top results but lack transparency, especially in clinical settings requiring interpretability. X-Node enhances GNN interpretability by integrating explanation generation directly into the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs are effective but suffer from a lack of interpretability, crucial in sensitive domains like medical imaging.

Method: X-Node incorporates a structured context vector for every node and uses a Reasoner module for explanation generation. It combines embeddings reconstruction, natural language explanations, and a feedback mechanism affecting message-passing.

Result: X-Node demonstrates efficient classification accuracy while creating faithful, per-node explanations on graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST.

Conclusion: By enhancing transparency without compromising performance, X-Node paves the way for broader adoption of GNNs in high-stakes contexts such as medical applications.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

*Xinrui Li,Qilin Fan,Tianfu Wang,Kaiwen Wei,Ke Yu,Xu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphFedMIG, a federated graph learning framework designed to handle class imbalance issues caused by non-IID data distributions, achieving superior results on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing class imbalance challenges in federated graph learning caused by biased neighborhood information and statistical heterogeneity.

Method: GraphFedMIG uses a hierarchical generative adversarial network where local generators produce feature representations aided by mutual information-guided adjustments to focus on minority-class features.

Result: GraphFedMIG shows superior performance against baselines on four real-world datasets, achieving better handling of class imbalance issues.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates statistical heterogeneity and class imbalance challenges in federated graph learning, improving model expressiveness and identification of minority classes.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve world modeling methods that surpass reconstruction-based approaches and advance latent state representations using nonlinear dynamics.

Method: The technique uses JEPAs with neural ODEs and employs specialized loss functions to enforce structured embeddings and smooth transitions in latent space.

Result: Demonstrated structured latent space modeling for a pendulum system using image data, showing the practical utility of the approach.

Conclusion: The technique is a promising step for general control algorithms and estimation techniques in robotics and dynamic systems.

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

TL;DR: ReLU networks' sharp transitions make gradient-based explanations noisy, and this paper introduces a spectral framework to analyze and address issues of smoothness and faithfulness in explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient-based explanations for ReLU networks are noisy and hard to interpret due to sharp transitions in the network, prompting the need for methods to quantify and enhance explanation quality.

Method: The authors developed a spectral framework to analyze smoothness and faithfulness in explanations, quantify the trade-offs, and measure distortions caused by surrogate models.

Result: The study defined and measured an "explanation gap," characterized distortions in surrogate-explanations, and validated findings across datasets, design choices, and experiments.

Conclusion: A principled spectral framework can analyze and improve the trade-off between smoothness and faithfulness in ReLU networks, offering precise tools for evaluating explanation distortion.

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

### [269] [Contrastive ECOC: Learning Output Codes for Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10491)
*Che-Yu Chou,Hung-Hsuan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents three models for learning data-driven error-correcting output codebooks for multiclass classification, improving robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-hot encoding, while widely used for multiclass classification, may not always be optimal. Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) offer a potential improvement but rely on manually designed or random codebooks, which are not efficient or dataset-specific.

Method: The paper introduces three models that utilize contrastive learning to automatically learn codebooks directly and adaptively from data, removing the need for manual or random codebook generation.

Result: The proposed models were tested on four datasets, demonstrating improved robustness to adversarial attacks compared to two baseline methods.

Conclusion: Automated contrastive learning-based codebook generation enhances ECOC's effectiveness, providing both adaptability and resilience compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four
datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial
attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at

*Jiulin Li,Ping Huang,Yexin Li,Shuo Chen,Juewen Hu,Ye Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAGUS is a modular framework for multimodal understanding and generation that combines reasoning from LLMs and high-fidelity generation from diffusion models. It uses a decoupled two-stage process with multiple agents working collaboratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of autoregressive language models for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity generation remains challenging, as existing methods are inflexible and lack scalability in handling multimodal applications.

Method: MAGUS introduces a modular two-phase framework. The Cognition phase involves three multimodal agents for structured understanding, and the Deliberation phase employs a Growth-Aware Search to align LLM reasoning with diffusion-based generation.

Result: MAGUS demonstrates superior performance over strong baselines and state-of-the-art systems in multimodal tasks, including surpassing GPT-4o on the MME benchmark.

Conclusion: MAGUS effectively enables scalable and flexible any-to-any multimodal understanding and generation without requiring joint training, establishing itself as a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

### [271] [Nonlocal Monte Carlo via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10520)
*Dmitrii Dobrynin,Masoud Mohseni,John Paul Strachan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (RL)-trained Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithm to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), including simulated annealing or parallel tempering, struggle with complex optimization problems near computational phase transitions, where rigid variables and suboptimal basins hinder sampling high-quality solutions.

Method: The paper employs deep RL to train nonlocal transition policies of Nonequilibrium Nonlocal Monte Carlo algorithms. The RL model observes energy changes and local minimum energy landscape geometry as rewards and states, respectively, for training.

Result: The trained policies outperform traditional MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing approaches on hard 4-SAT benchmarks, achieving better residual energy, time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions.

Conclusion: Deep RL provides an effective way to design enhanced Monte Carlo algorithms, offering improved exploration and solution quality for challenging optimization problems.

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

*Hao Luan,Yi Xian Goh,See-Kiong Ng,Chun Kai Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained joint generation with multiple diffusion models, ensuring task-specific constraints while avoiding retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jointly correlated sample generation and enforcing task-specific constraints with pre-trained diffusion models at test-time is challenging, especially without expensive retraining.

Method: PCD uses a coupled guidance term in generative dynamics and a projection step in each diffusion iteration to ensure inter-model coordination and hard constraint enforcement.

Result: PCD demonstrates effective results in image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning with improved coupling and guaranteed constraints.

Conclusion: The study confirms that PCD enhances coordination between diffusion models under constraints while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

TL;DR: The paper presents Applm, a computational framework using the xTrimoPGLM protein language model, to identify allergen proteins more accurately than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Allergens pose significant health risks, driving the need for better identification methods.

Method: The framework utilizes the 100-billion parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model, trained on one trillion tokens, to distinguish allergens from non-allergens in challenging scenarios.

Result: Applm outperformed seven state-of-the-art tools across tasks like identifying novel allergens, differentiating homologous sequences, and analyzing mutation impacts.

Conclusion: Applm effectively leverages language model capabilities to advance allergen prediction, offering open-source software and benchmark datasets for broader scientific use.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

*Zetian Sun,Dongfang Li,Zhuoen Chen,Yuhuai Qin,Baotian Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses reward sparsity in RL tasks by introducing the SWE-oriented RL Framework and Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), demonstrating significant performance improvements in software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning tasks, focusing on software engineering scenarios where multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are crucial.

Method: The authors introduce the SWE-oriented RL Framework to enable multi-turn interaction, docker-based execution, and customizable rewards. They also propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a mechanism that accumulates rewards only if high-level rewards surpass a predefined threshold.

Result: Experiments show that G-RA significantly improves completion and modification rates in SWE-bench Verified and kBench benchmarks, mitigating reward misalignment issues.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and G-RA method offer a practical solution to reward misalignment, underlining the importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATE-B, a tool using large language models to simplify treatment effect estimation from observational data by automating key causal inference steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal inference for treatment effect estimation is critical but remains inaccessible to many due to its complexity, requiring expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment, and model selection.

Method: CATE-B leverages large language models in an agentic framework to assist users in building causal models, identifying robust adjustment sets, and choosing appropriate regression methods.

Result: CATE-B combines machine learning with interactive causal inference assistance, offering improvements in accessibility and rigor for treatment effect estimation.

Conclusion: The system lowers the technical barrier to causal analysis while introducing a new suite of benchmarks for automated treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

### [276] [GNN-based Unified Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10583)
*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified learning framework using graph representation and a shared GNN to enhance generalizability across heterogeneous deep learning models for medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in medical imaging struggles with generalizability due to distribution shifts caused by varied imaging protocols, patient demographics, and equipment. Current practices require training distinct models per hospital, creating inefficiencies.

Method: This paper proposes a unified learning paradigm, representing each model in a graph learning space and optimizing them through a unified GNN (uGNN). This approach facilitates parameter sharing and knowledge transfer across different architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs).

Result: Unified learning significantly improves model performance under distribution shifts, demonstrated through experiments on MorphoMNIST and MedMNIST datasets, showing robustness to unseen and heterogeneous data distributions.

Conclusion: The method allows coherent training of diverse models with enhanced generalizability across different medical imaging tasks, showcasing a robust and efficient approach to addressing domain-fracture challenges.

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

*Xuanhao Mu,Gökhan Demirel,Yuzhe Zhang,Jianlei Liu,Thorsten Schlachter,Veit Hagenmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of upsampling in energy system models by introducing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which outperform conventional methods in both error reduction and MPC accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upsampling time series in energy network design often leads to information loss or noise using conventional methods, and advanced models face challenges such as insufficient context and the need for inaccessible high-resolution training data.

Method: Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs) are proposed as a novel approach that does not require ground-truth high-resolution data for training.

Result: The proposed method reduces root mean square error (RMSE) in upsampling tasks by 9% and improves accuracy in model predictive control (MPC) applications by 13%.

Conclusion: Generative Adversarial Transformers offer a promising solution to the upsampling challenges in energy systems, achieving improved accuracy without relying on high-resolution training data.

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

TL;DR: FreeGAD, a training-free method, surpasses traditional deep learning-based approaches in graph anomaly detection (GAD) by reducing complexity and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based GAD methods face challenges like high deployment costs and limited scalability due to complex training phases.

Method: FreeGAD employs an affinity-gated residual encoder for anomaly-aware representations, uses anchor nodes as pseudo guides, and calculates anomaly scores based on statistical deviations. No training is required.

Result: Experiments confirm FreeGAD's superior performance, efficiency, and scalability across diverse benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FreeGAD provides a scalable and effective solution for GAD, questioning the necessity of traditional training phases and making deployment more feasible.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Motivation: To address reliability issues in explaining deep networks' predictions caused by insufficient formalism.

Method: Adopting probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally study explanation methods and proposing remedies like a standard perturbation scale and SpectralLens.

Result: The study identifies spectral bias from gradient usage, highlights the impact of perturbation hyperparameters, and provides analytical solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed formalism improves the reliability of explanation methods, substantiated through theoretical and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the new security challenges posed by the distributed nature of Split Learning, which, while enhancing privacy, may expose vulnerabilities.

Method: This study conducts a systematic review, classifying attacks based on various factors and evaluating existing defense mechanisms such as cryptographic and hybrid solutions.

Result: The analysis highlights both the effectiveness and limitations of current defenses, identifying gaps in security and areas that need improvement.

Conclusion: Improving Split Learning's privacy and security requires addressing the identified gaps and exploring new research directions.

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a collaborative learning approach that improves
privacy by keeping data on the client-side while sharing only the intermediate

security challenges, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of potential
attacks. This paper systematically reviews various attacks on SL, classifying
them based on factors such as the attacker's role, the type of privacy risks,
when data leaks occur, and where vulnerabilities exist. We also analyze
existing defense methods, including cryptographic methods, data modification
approaches, distributed techniques, and hybrid solutions. Our findings reveal

TL;DR: The paper enhances Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) methods by reducing sample inefficiency using variance-reduction techniques in policy gradient methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously in MORL while improving sample efficiency in policy gradient methods.

Method: The study incorporates variance-reduction techniques into policy gradient methods to decrease sample complexity without imposing strict assumptions.

Result: The proposed approach improves the sample efficiency of policy gradients in MORL under general conditions.

Conclusion: Implementing variance-reduction techniques can make MORL more scalable and efficient in large state-action spaces, maintaining its efficacy in complex decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Item Response Theory (IRT) to guide the partitioning of datasets for more robust Machine Learning validation, demonstrating improved insights into bias and variance and significant impacts on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data partitioning methods often overlook individual instance quality in datasets, potentially limiting robust model validation.

Method: The study utilized IRT parameters to generate balanced dataset partitions and evaluated their impact on ML model performance across four tabular datasets.

Result: IRT-informed partitions revealed subgroups with heterogeneous characteristics, reduced bias-variance tradeoff, and highlighted the adverse effects of training with high-guessing instances.

Conclusion: Using IRT to guide dataset partitioning offers a promising approach to enhancing ML model validation by leveraging instance heterogeneity and optimizing training data selection.

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

*Patrick Soga,Zhenyu Lei,Yinhan He,Camille Bilodeau,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel energy-based model for predicting binding free energy changes ($\Delta\Delta G$), showing improved performance over existing methods especially in protein and antibody optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prediction of binding free energy changes ($\Delta\Delta G$) is essential in drug discovery and protein engineering. Existing methods struggle with estimating the full conformational distribution of protein complexes, which is deemed computationally intractable.

Method: The paper introduces a model that decomposes $\Delta\Delta G$ into a sequence-based component (estimated by inverse folding) and a structure-based component (estimated by an energy model). By assuming equilibrium between bound and unbound states and applying statistical mechanics principles, it simplifies the estimation process.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction tasks and demonstrates effectiveness in antibody optimization against SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion: Incorporating energy-based physical inductive biases and a novel decomposition framework enhances the accuracy of $\Delta\Delta G$ predictions, making the method promising for protein engineering and drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

*Yihua Wang,Qi Jia,Cong Xu,Feiyu Chen,Yuhan Liu,Haotian Zhang,Liang Jin,Lu Liu,Zhichun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses the challenges of multimodal sarcasm detection and introduces the Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model, which outperforms existing methods by avoiding shortcut learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limitations of shortcut learning and improve modality fusion for multimodal sarcasm detection, which is critical for detecting complex emotions.

Method: The study introduces MUStARD++$^{R}$, a dataset refined to remove shortcut signals from MUStARD++, and employs the Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model for efficient modality fusion.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the MCIB model achieves superior performance in sarcasm detection without relying on shortcut signals.

Conclusion: Focusing on effective modality fusion and eliminating shortcut learning enhances the generalization and accuracy of sarcasm detection models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

*Chenkai Guo,Yikai Zhu,Jing Yangum,Renxiang Guan,Por Lip Yee,Guangdun Peng,Dayu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPHENIC, a spatial clustering method that enhances spatial transcriptomics analysis by addressing noisy profiles and improving spatial embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial transcriptomics clustering methods struggle with noisy data and insufficient exploitation of spatial neighborhood information, which limits their effectiveness in identifying cell subpopulations.

Method: SPHENIC integrates topological features to stabilize representation learning and employs a Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM) to enhance spatial embeddings by adjusting the similarity between cells based on their neighborhood relations.

Result: SPHENIC shows superior spatial clustering performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across 14 benchmark datasets by improving accuracy by 3.31%-6.54%.

Conclusion: SPHENIC provides a robust and accurate approach to spatial clustering in spatial transcriptomics, offering improved insights into cellular distributions while addressing limitations in existing methods.

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

### [286] [Geospatial Diffusion for Land Cover Imperviousness Change Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10649)
*Debvrat Varshney,Vibhas Vats,Bhartendu Pandey,Christa Brelsford,Philipe Dias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the use of Generative AI (GenAI), specifically a diffusion model, for decadal forecasting of land-use and land-cover change (LULC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current capabilities in Earth System modeling have advanced in forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric processes but are limited in predicting land-use and land-cover change, which is vital for assessing risks and consequences of climate scenarios.

Method: The authors frame LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem using historical and auxiliary data sources and train a diffusion model for forecasting impervious surfaces. They evaluate its performance by comparing it to a baseline model across 12 metropolitan areas.

Result: The diffusion model demonstrates a lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the baseline when forecasted at spatial resolutions of at least 0.7x0.7 km².

Conclusion: The study validates the feasibility of using generative models to capture spatiotemporal patterns in LULC forecasting and suggests incorporating additional physical properties and scenario drivers in future research.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph classification approach using tabularized graph data derived from Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm variants to achieve competitive accuracy with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and interpretability of graph classification methods while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Method: Graph data is tabularized using variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, followed by the application of tabular data classification methods. The expressive power of these variants is theoretically characterized.

Result: The approach matches the accuracy of leading graph neural networks and kernels, demonstrating improved efficiency in either memory or computational time based on the dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a viable alternative to existing approaches, combining efficiency with theoretical rigor and potential for interpretability.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for graph classification based on tabularizing
graph data via variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then applying
methods for tabular data. We investigate a comprehensive class of
Weisfeiler-Leman variants obtained by modifying the underlying logical
framework and establish a precise theoretical characterization of their
expressive power. We then test two selected variants on twelve benchmark
datasets that span a range of different domains. The experiments demonstrate
that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art graph neural
networks and graph kernels while being more time or memory efficient, depending
on the dataset. We also briefly discuss directly extracting interpretable modal
logic formulas from graph datasets.

### [288] [REFN: A Reinforcement-Learning-From-Network Framework against 1-day/n-day Exploitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10701)
*Tianlong Yu,Lihong Liu,Ziyi Zhou,Fudu Xing,Kailong Wang,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFN is a novel framework that uses reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate network filters, aiming to prevent 1 day or n day vulnerabilities. It surpasses traditional methods in accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1 day or n day vulnerabilities present significant security risks due to delayed patching and limited scalability of current defenses. Existing solutions struggle with compatibility, efficiency, and manual deployment challenges.

Method: REFN employs reinforcement learning (RL) from online network rewards, rather than traditional human feedback, to train LLMs. It addresses core challenges by utilizing Agentic RAG-based knowledge distillation, an RL-from-VNF pipeline to bridge language and network operations, and online validation to mitigate LLM errors.

Result: REFN achieved 21.1% higher accuracy compared to alternatives, reduced mean time to patch to 3.65 hours, and demonstrated scalability to 10,000 devices.

Conclusion: REFN is a scalable, efficient, and accurate approach that leverages LLMs and RL to prevent large-scale exploitations effectively. It marks a significant step forward in automating vulnerability mitigation and network defense.

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the
Online Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs. Evaluated across 22
families of 1 day or n day exploits, REFN demonstrates effectiveness (21.1
percent higher accuracy than alternatives), efficiency (Mean Time To Patch of
3.65 hours) and scalability (easily scale to 10K devices). REFN serves as an
initial step toward training LLMs to rapidly prevent massive scale 1 day or n
day exploitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a GPU-powered antenna simulation framework using open-source software to enable efficient data generation for machine learning-driven antenna design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the data-hungry nature of machine learning models in antenna design, where obtaining enough training samples from EM simulations is limited by high computational costs.

Method: The study uses GPUs to perform a significant number of antenna simulations with predefined or random parameters, utilizing open-source EM simulation software (gprMax) and compares the outcomes with commercial EM software.

Result: It is demonstrated that entry-level GPUs outperform high-end CPUs, and high-end gaming GPUs achieve 18x the computational performance of high-end CPUs. Additionally, the open-source software produces results similar to commercial software for fine spatial resolution simulations.

Conclusion: The approach enables the efficient generation of antenna datasets for machine learning applications, showing that GPUs and open-source tools can significantly reduce simulation time while ensuring comparable accuracy.

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

*Kejia Fan,Jianheng Tang,Zhirui Yang,Feijiang Han,Jiaxu Li,Run He,Yajiang Huang,Anfeng Liu,Houbing Herbert Song,Yunhuai Liu,Huiping Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) using dual-stream least squares to address non-IID data issues in personalized federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized Federated Learning struggles with non-IID data distribution which weakens both generalization and personalization in collaborative training.

Method: APFL employs a foundation model for feature extraction followed by dual-stream analytic models—one for collective generalization and one for individual personalization, leveraging least squares for ideal heterogeneity invariance.

Result: APFL achieves significant accuracy improvements of 1.10%-15.45% over existing methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed APFL method successfully counteracts non-IID data challenges, ensuring enhanced generalization and personalization in federated learning settings.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

*Zhipeng Chen,Xiaobo Qin,Youbin Wu,Yue Ling,Qinghao Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao,Guang Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the role of Pass@k as a reward metric in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), particularly its impact on exploration and exploitation balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous RLVR approaches using Pass@1 metrics face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, often leading to conservative policies and local optima. Better reward metrics like Pass@k could potentially address this issue.

Method: The paper proposes using Pass@k as the reward for RLVR and evaluates its effect on exploration. They derive an analytical solution for the advantage of Pass@k training that enhances policy training efficiency. They also experimentally explore advantage function design.

Result: Pass@k as the reward improves exploration, demonstrates efficiency through derived analytical insights, and suggests that exploration and exploitation are not conflicting but mutually enhancing in RLVR.

Conclusion: Pass@k shows promise for balancing exploration and exploitation in RLVR. Future work could benefit from designing specific advantage functions for RLVR, as initially explored in this study.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Motivation: To enable transformers to effectively handle large physical system datasets by overcoming challenges of quadratic attention mechanism scaling.

Method: The paper adapts the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data, implements the Erwin NSA model, and evaluates it on three physical science datasets. It also reproduces previous experimental results to confirm their validity.

Result: Performance of the Erwin NSA model matches or exceeds the original Erwin model on datasets covering cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air pressure modeling.

Conclusion: The integration of NSA into the Erwin model improves transformer efficiency and capability on large physical datasets, while verifying the reliability of previous experimental results.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

*Dong Xu,Zhangfan Yang,Jenna Xinyi Yao,Shuangbao Song,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBEX is a novel generative pipeline designed to overcome data scarcity in protein-ligand complex generation for drug discovery. It integrates PAC-Bayesian information bottleneck theory and efficient optimization techniques to drastically improve docking success rates, compatibility, and chemical validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of data scarcity in publicly available protein-ligand complexes, which hampers the effectiveness of generative models for structure-based drug discovery.

Method: IBEX utilizes PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to analyze sample information density and incorporates a Scaffold Hopping task in its generative pipeline. It retains the original TargetDiff architecture and adds an L-BFGS optimization step for fine molecular adjustments.

Result: IBEX improves the zero-shot docking success rate from 53% to 64%, raises the mean Vina score from -7.41 to -8.07 kcal/mol, achieves best median Vina energy in 57 out of 100 pockets, increases QED by 25%, and significantly enhances diversity and validity metrics.

Conclusion: IBEX outperforms existing methods in generating transferable and accurate protein-ligand complexes under conditions of limited data availability, demonstrating its utility in advancing generative drug discovery pipelines.

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an algorithm for non-stationary RMABs, incorporating sliding window RL and UCB mechanisms, achieving a regret bound suitable for varying transition dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RMAB approaches assume stationary MDP dynamics, which often fail in real-world applications like healthcare due to non-stationary behavior, creating a need for new solutions.

Method: The authors integrate sliding window reinforcement learning with an upper confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to address non-stationary dynamics and variations constrained by a bounded variation budget.

Result: They prove that their algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{1/4} T^{3/4})$ under a relaxed definition of regret, laying a theoretical foundation for non-stationary RMABs.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm and regret analysis bridge the gap between stationary RMAB assumptions and real-world non-stationary applications, offering a meaningful step forward in handling dynamic environments.

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Motivation: To address the limitations of Transformer architectures in retaining long-range context, continual learning, and knowledge integration.

Method: Unified framework combining neuroscience principles and engineering advances, categorized by functional objectives, memory representation types, and integration mechanisms.

Result: Identified a shift from static memory systems to adaptive, test-time learning ones, along with strategies to address scalability and interference challenges.

Conclusion: The paper provides guidance for developing cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer architectures through memory augmentation.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

*Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Kimberly Mai,Prakhar Ganesh,Martin Vechev,Ferdinando Fioretto,Matthew Jagielski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML) to help unify related methodologies and facilitate effective application of DM principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding and implementation of Data Minimization principles in machine learning, addressing confusion among practitioners, and enhancing adherence to data protection regulations.

Method: The authors propose a unified DMML framework outlining a systematic data pipeline, adversaries, and points of minimization to review the relevant literature.

Result: The framework organizes and defines DM-related methodologies, paving the way for their structured adoption in AI/ML applications.

Conclusion: This work simplifies the adoption of Data Minimization principles by providing clarity and structured insights, enhancing their integration in regulatory-compliant machine learning practices.

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

### [297] [Efficiently Verifiable Proofs of Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10866)
*Ari Karchmer,Seth Neel,Martin Pawelczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interactive verification paradigm to address trust issues in computationally expensive data attribution methods by enabling resource-constrained parties to verify results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data attribution methods are computationally expensive, raising trust issues for resource-limited parties reliant on results for critical applications like data pricing.

Method: An interactive verification protocol is introduced where a computationally powerful Prover learns data attributions and engages with a resource-constrained Verifier, using PAC guarantees to ensure validity.

Result: The protocol can verify data attributions within {
ε}-accuracy using only O(1/{
ε}) workload for the Verifier, regardless of dataset size, and detects arbitrary Prover deviations.

Conclusion: This paradigm ensures trust in data attribution for resource-constrained Verifiers while maintaining efficiency, broadening applicability to various tasks.

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset, \ourdataset, to enhance AI-driven therapeutic design by integrating constraints extracted from experimental priors in literature. It demonstrates superior performance in molecular design tasks and ensures safer outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve AI-driven therapeutic design, particularly to mitigate risks like proposing mutagenic molecules by incorporating experimental priors missing in traditional models.

Method: The paper constructs \ourdataset using LLM pipelines to extract and summarize compound-related information from scientific literature into natural language facts paired with entity representations. It employs models like LLM, CLIP, and LLava for experimentation.

Result: Models pretrained with \ourdataset show superior performance in TDC regression and classification tasks, outperforming some larger architectures, ensuring safer and effective molecular proposals in GuacaMol.

Conclusion: \ourdataset proves to be a valuable resource for training models with strong experimental priors, improving the safety and efficacy of model outputs in therapeutic design tasks, and is publicly released for broader usage.

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

*Brooke R. Weborg,Gursel Serpen*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper explores Echo State Networks (ESNs) using four benchmark tasks, offering guidelines for parameter configuration and architecture tuning to assist newcomers in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge the knowledge and experience gap for individuals entering the field of Echo State Networks by investigating how parameter choices and architecture configurations impact performance.

Method: The authors modeled and experimented with four types of benchmark tasks—time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time series classification—to analyze the effects of parameter adjustments and architectural changes in ESNs.

Result: The research demonstrated the effect of different parameter settings, architectural variations, and design choices on the performance of Echo State Networks within various problem domains.

Conclusion: The findings aid in understanding the performance dynamics of ESNs and provide heuristics for configuring parameters and architecture, benefiting researchers and practitioners in achieving successful ESN implementations.

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

*Shweta Salaria,Zhuoran Liu,Nelson Mimura Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: FMwork is a framework designed for efficient benchmarking of foundation models by combining best practices in meta-metrics, parameter selection, and strategic cost-performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the inference performance of foundation models is complex due to interactions between hardware and software. A comprehensive yet efficient benchmarking approach is needed to avoid exhaustive and impractical testing.

Method: The authors developed FMwork, a framework including meta-metrics to assess benchmarking effort and result accuracy, systematic parameter selection, and cost-performance trade-off analysis.

Result: FMwork achieved up to 24x improvements in experimentation speed/resource usage compared to ground-truth settings. Additionally, reduced benchmarking output size yields an additional 2.7x efficiency while retaining 96.6% accuracy.

Conclusion: FMwork effectively balances benchmarking accuracy and efficiency, offering significant improvements in experimental resource optimization for foundation model evaluations.

Abstract: Benchmarking inference performance (speed) of Foundation Models such as Large
Language Models (LLM) involves navigating a vast experimental landscape to
understand the complex interactions between hardware and software components.
However, evaluating every possible test configuration is impractical,
unfeasible and unnecessary. To address this challenge, we introduce FMwork, a
comprehensive and methodical approach to creating a controlled testing
environment that accurately reflects and characterizes performance. FMwork
comprises a set of benchmkaring best practices with three key components: 1)
meta-metrics, 2) parameter selection, and 3) strategic cost-performance
evaluation. Meta-metrics account for time and resources spent on benchmarking
and the relative accuracy of the results compared to a larger body of
measurements, representing the complete experimental space. FMwork
operationalizes the meta-metrics and provides efficient strategies for
parameter selection and cost-performance analysis. Using the framework, we show
up to 24x improvement (speedup and/or resource savings) running sweeps of
experiments compared to the ground truth. Even already considering a subset of
experiments as reference point (using the power of two for batch sizes),
reducing experimental output size from 1024 to 128 tokens yields another 2.7x
gain while keeping 96.6% accuracy for an evaluation using Llama 3.1 8B model.

*Abtin Molavi,Amanda Xu,Ethan Cecchetti,Swamit Tannu,Aws Albarghouthi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing (QMR) compilers for diverse quantum architectures using a domain-specific language called Marol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum compilers face challenges due to the diversity and rapid evolution of quantum architectures, requiring customized QMR solutions for different hardware, connectivity, and error constraints.

Method: The authors propose a universal framework based on a common structure, the device state machine, which formulates QMR problems abstractly and introduces Marol as a domain-specific language to define these problems. A parametric solver is used to address QMR problems specified in Marol.

Result: The generated compilers are competitive with specialized, handwritten compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality, as demonstrated through thorough evaluations on various quantum architectures and hardware platforms.

Conclusion: This approach simplifies the development of quantum compilers, paving the way for efficient solutions that can adapt to emerging quantum architectures and diverse requirements.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical
computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry,
and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they
minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation
step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit
qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while
satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the
landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving.
Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for
different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error
correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing
compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is
different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use
to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a
domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the
well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol.
We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a
powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We
evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior
and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all
major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated
compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of
runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify
development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue
to emerge.

*Xu Ma,Jiajie Zhang,Fujing Xie,Sören Schwertfeger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a WiFi-based framework for indoor localization using OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) to enhance robot navigation, achieving high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for autonomous robots to localize indoors where GPS signals are absent motivates this work. It addresses the challenge by leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure and osmAG for effective and scalable localization.

Method: The framework operates in two phases: an offline phase where WiFi Access Points are localized via iterative optimization (accounting for wall attenuation), and an online phase where real-time robot localization uses the augmented osmAG map. Comparisons are made against traditional trilateration and fingerprinting approaches.

Result: The approach reduces WiFi AP localization error to 3.79 m, robot localization to 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas, and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted areas. It outperforms alternatives in accuracy and space efficiency.

Conclusion: Validated in a large, multi-floor environment, the framework proves its scalability, accuracy, and practicality, offering a solution to indoor localization challenges for robotics, including the kidnapped robot problem.

Abstract: Global localization is essential for autonomous robotics, especially in
indoor environments where the GPS signal is denied. We propose a novel
WiFi-based localization framework that leverages ubiquitous wireless
infrastructure and the OpenStreetMap Area Graph (osmAG) for large-scale indoor
environments. Our approach integrates signal propagation modeling with osmAG's
geometric and topological priors. In the offline phase, an iterative
optimization algorithm localizes WiFi Access Points (APs) by modeling wall
attenuation, achieving a mean localization error of 3.79 m (35.3\% improvement
over trilateration). In the online phase, real-time robot localization uses the
augmented osmAG map, yielding a mean error of 3.12 m in fingerprinted areas
(8.77\% improvement over KNN fingerprinting) and 3.83 m in non-fingerprinted
areas (81.05\% improvement). Comparison with a fingerprint-based method shows
that our approach is much more space efficient and achieves superior
localization accuracy, especially for positions where no fingerprint data are
available. Validated across a complex 11,025 &m^2& multi-floor environment,
this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor robotic
localization, solving the kidnapped robot problem. The code and dataset are

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS) to generate optimal, collision-free trajectories in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating time-dependent trajectories in cluttered dynamic environments is challenging due to numerous spatial and temporal constraints and the difficulty of finding an initial guess for solvers.

Method: The authors use the Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS) framework, which does not require an initial solver guess, along with deriving GCS-compatible constraints and adapting them intuitively for dynamic scenarios.

Result: The paper demonstrates that ST-GCS matches standard GCS performance in static environments and successfully handles dynamic environments to produce minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Conclusion: ST-GCS effectively generalizes GCS to dynamic environments, solving the problem of trajectory generation without requiring solver initialization in complex settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we create optimal, collision-free, time-dependent trajectories
through cluttered dynamic environments. The many spatial and temporal
constraints make finding an initial guess for a numerical solver difficult.
Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) and the recently developed Space-Time Graphs of
Convex Sets formulation (ST-GCS) enable us to generate optimal minimum distance
collision-free trajectories without providing an initial guess to the solver.
We also explore the derivation of general GCS-compatible constraints and
document an intuitive strategy for adapting general constraints to the
framework. We show that ST-GCS produces equivalent trajectories to the standard
GCS formulation when the environment is static. We then show ST-GCS operating
in dynamic environments to find minimum distance collision-free trajectories.

Method: The HDDPC framework merges foot contact scheduling and continuous domain trajectory planning, utilizing a Hankel matrix-based system representation with integrated step-to-step transitions.

Result: Validation on the Atalante exoskeleton shows enhanced robustness and adaptability of the locomotion systems.

Conclusion: The HDDPC framework offers an efficient solution for real-time, reactive, and adaptable bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons, validated through improved system performance.

Abstract: Robust bipedal locomotion in exoskeletons requires the ability to dynamically
react to changes in the environment in real time. This paper introduces the
hybrid data-driven predictive control (HDDPC) framework, an extension of the
data-enabled predictive control, that addresses these challenges by
simultaneously planning foot contact schedules and continuous domain
trajectories. The proposed framework utilizes a Hankel matrix-based
representation to model system dynamics, incorporating step-to-step (S2S)
transitions to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments. By integrating
contact scheduling with trajectory planning, the framework offers an efficient,
unified solution for locomotion motion synthesis that enables robust and
reactive walking through online replanning. We validate the approach on the
Atalante exoskeleton, demonstrating improved robustness and adaptability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReconVLA, a reconstructive Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to address visual attention allocation challenges in robotic agents by employing implicit grounding through diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle to allocate visual attention to targeted areas during multimodal integration for action execution, thus hindering effective task-specific manipulations.

Method: ReconVLA leverages an implicit grounding paradigm, where diffusion transformers reconstruct gaze regions based on visual outputs to prompt fine-grained representations and targeted visual attention allocation. A large-scale dataset enhances model generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments across simulation and real-world settings demonstrate ReconVLA's precise manipulation capabilities and improved generalization.

Conclusion: ReconVLA effectively refines visual attention grounding, enables precise action execution in robotic agents, and offers a significant advancement in multimodal robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic
agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However,
our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual
attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To
guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose
ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm.
Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to
reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target
manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained
representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively
leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise
manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising
over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic
datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction.
Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the
superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of
precise manipulation and generalization. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve mobile robot source seeking in complex environments by creating a method that adapts behavior based on signal reliability and mission urgency.

Method: BEASST uses Behavioral Entropy with Prelec's probability weighting function to model signal strength as a surrogate source location probability, enabling adaptive behavior and guaranteeing convergence.

Result: Experimental results show BEASST outperforms existing methods, reducing path length by 15% and localization time by 20% in scenarios like DARPA SubT and multi-room configurations.

Conclusion: BEASST offers a reliable, efficient robotic source-seeking strategy that combines theoretical guarantees and practical robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive
Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking
in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to
efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal
strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral
Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an
objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking
based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides
theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and
practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across
DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length

*Wenqi Zheng,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes FAVOR, a reinforcement learning method for multi-modal human activity recognition using large language models, enhancing reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of exploration of reinforcement learning applications in multi-modal human activity recognition, coupled with the need to enhance model generalization and reasoning capabilities with limited data.

Method: The proposed FAVOR approach employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate candidate responses with reasoning traces, evaluates them using reward functions, and optimizes the model using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments across four human activity recognition datasets and five setups confirm the method's effectiveness and superior performance.

Conclusion: FAVOR improves few-shot recognition abilities, reasoning capabilities, and enables explainable analyses for multi-modal human activity recognition tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large reasoning models enables learning from
feedback on their outputs, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where
fine-tuning data is limited. However, its application in multi-modal human
activity recognition (HAR) domains remains largely underexplored. Our work
extends reinforcement learning to the human activity recognition domain with
multimodal large language models. By incorporating visual reinforcement
learning in the training process, the model's generalization ability on
few-shot recognition can be greatly improved. Additionally, visual
reinforcement learning can enhance the model's reasoning ability and enable
explainable analysis in the inference stage. We name our few-shot human
activity recognition method with visual reinforcement learning FAVOR.
Specifically, our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) to generate multiple candidate responses for the human activity image,
each containing reasoning traces and final answers. These responses are then
evaluated using reward functions, and the MLLM model is subsequently optimized
using the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. In this way, the
MLLM model can be adapted to human activity recognition with only a few
samples. Extensive experiments on four human activity recognition datasets and
five different settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic-aware framework for upper-limb exoskeletons using large language models and anomaly detection for adaptive, safe, and intuitive assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current upper-limb exoskeletons in understanding task semantics and collaboratively planning actions, which limits their adaptability and generalizability in home-care scenarios.

Method: The framework uses large language models for task semantics, allows intent capture in transparent mode, employs a diffusion-based anomaly detector for monitoring interactions, and ensures safety through online trajectory refinement and impedance control.

Result: Experimental results show the framework aligns with user cognition, adapts to various semantic tasks, and reliably detects and responds to anomalies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves adaptability, safety, and intent alignment of upper-limb exoskeletons, making them more effective for diverse home-care tasks.

Abstract: Upper-limb exoskeletons are primarily designed to provide assistive support
by accurately interpreting and responding to human intentions. In home-care
scenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations
based on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in
accordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing
solutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or
collaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that
integrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the
delivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach
begins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the
wearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted
from the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate
assistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used
to continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger
real-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,
online trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety
and regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to
semantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the primary challenge of data sparsity in low-cost LiDAR sensors, which limits their application in robotic perception tasks.

Method: Introduces a novel framework leveraging non-repeating scanning LiDAR (NRS-LiDAR) for dense reflectance image reconstruction, addressing reflectance calibration and dynamic scene handling. A new dataset and densification network are developed.

Result: The framework successfully reconstructs dense reflectance images from sparse data, demonstrating its effectiveness for applications like loop closure and traffic lane detection.

Conclusion: By overcoming the limitations of sparse LiDAR data, the proposed method broadens the applicability of low-cost LiDAR sensors in real-world settings.

Abstract: Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive
optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as
measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation
now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active
optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of
active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance
from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination
conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such
as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities,
typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge
with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their
broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an
innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse
data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR
(NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration
and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the
reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key
contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR
reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for
NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane
detection using the generated dense reflectance images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the complex integration of robotic systems in SMEs and research, reducing reliance on external expertise and addressing vendor lock-in issues.

Method: A software framework was developed with an abstraction layer for robot interfaces, implemented using Python. The framework was tested on a bin-picking cell featuring a Yaskawa Motoman GP4.

Result: The proposed framework successfully reduced the complexity of managing robot interfaces, making it easier to deploy robotic components into larger systems.

Conclusion: The framework eased the use of modern robotic systems, demonstrating potential for enabling SMEs and researchers to integrate robotic subsystems without extensive expertise.

Abstract: Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a
larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing,
maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result,
many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in
some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic
research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in
the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by
researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart
system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot
interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that
reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is
solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a
modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers
and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of
the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa
Motoman GP4.

*Zhuoyuan Yu,Yuxing Long,Zihan Yang,Chengyan Zeng,Hongwei Fan,Jiyao Zhang,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a Self-correction Flywheel paradigm to enhance error recovery in vision-and-language navigation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and demonstrating robust real-world capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-and-language navigation models lack effective error correction, limiting their ability to recover from trajectory deviations during instruction execution.

Method: The paper introduces the Self-correction Flywheel paradigm, leveraging the model's own error trajectories to generate self-correction data for continued training, enabling iterative improvement through multiple cycles.

Result: The proposed model, CorrectNav, achieved significant improvements on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks, with 65.1% and 69.3% success rates, respectively, outperforming previous models by 8.2% and 16.4%.

Conclusion: The Self-correction Flywheel enables consistent improvement of navigation models, with real-world robot tests confirming its ability to handle errors, avoid dynamic obstacles, and follow long instructions reliably.

Abstract: Existing vision-and-language navigation models often deviate from the correct
trajectory when executing instructions. However, these models lack effective
error correction capability, hindering their recovery from errors. To address
this challenge, we propose Self-correction Flywheel, a novel post-training
paradigm. Instead of considering the model's error trajectories on the training
set as a drawback, our paradigm emphasizes their significance as a valuable
data source. We have developed a method to identify deviations in these error
trajectories and devised innovative techniques to automatically generate
self-correction data for perception and action. These self-correction data
serve as fuel to power the model's continued training. The brilliance of our
paradigm is revealed when we re-evaluate the model on the training set,
uncovering new error trajectories. At this time, the self-correction flywheel
begins to spin. Through multiple flywheel iterations, we progressively enhance
our monocular RGB-based VLA navigation model CorrectNav. Experiments on R2R-CE
and RxR-CE benchmarks show CorrectNav achieves new state-of-the-art success
rates of 65.1% and 69.3%, surpassing prior best VLA navigation models by 8.2%
and 16.4%. Real robot tests in various indoor and outdoor environments
demonstrate \method's superior capability of error correction, dynamic obstacle
avoidance, and long instruction following.

### [313] [MASH: Cooperative-Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Single Humanoid Robot Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10423)
*Qi Liu,Xiaopeng Zhang,Mingshan Tan,Shuaikang Ma,Jinliang Ding,Yanjie Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to enhance the locomotion abilities of a single humanoid robot, treating limbs as independent agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for humanoid robot locomotion often either use single-agent reinforcement learning for each robot or multi-agent reinforcement learning for multi-robot tasks. This paper aims to bridge the gap by leveraging cooperative-heterogeneous MARL for optimizing the locomotion of a single humanoid robot.

Method: The proposed approach, MASH, considers each limb (legs and arms) as independent agents working with a shared global critic for cooperative learning. This enables exploration of the robot's action space while fostering coordination among agents.

Result: Experimental results show that MASH accelerates training convergence and enhances the robot's whole-body coordination, outpacing traditional single-agent reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: MASH introduces a new paradigm for humanoid robot control, demonstrating the potential of multi-agent reinforcement learning in optimizing single-robot locomotion and providing insights for future robotic strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to enhance locomotion for a single
humanoid robot through cooperative-heterogeneous multi-agent deep reinforcement
learning (MARL). While most existing methods typically employ single-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL
algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm:
applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single
humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for
single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an
independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global
critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates
training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming
conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances
the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new
insights into efficient locomotion strategies.

### [314] [KDPE: A Kernel Density Estimation Strategy for Diffusion Policy Trajectory Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10511)
*Andrea Rosasco,Federico Ceola,Giulia Pasquale,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KDPE introduces a Kernel Density Estimation-based filter to enhance the performance of diffusion models in robotic policy formulation, outperforming Diffusion Policy in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Diffusion Policy, which may produce unreliable robot trajectories due to its stochasticity and susceptibility to data outliers.

Method: KDPE employs a Kernel Density Estimation approach, using a manifold-aware kernel to filter and refine action trajectories, ensuring robust robot behavior during execution.

Result: KDPE demonstrates superior efficacy compared to Diffusion Policy in simulated single-arm tasks and real-world robotics experiments.

Conclusion: Filtering harmful trajectories with KDPE enhances robot policy execution with minimal computational overhead, paving the way for safer and more reliable robotic control systems.

Abstract: Learning robot policies that capture multimodality in the training data has
been a long-standing open challenge for behavior cloning. Recent approaches
tackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with
generative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on
a diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.
While achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that
may lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,
the stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of
generated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,
it can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work
focuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either
with large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.
Instead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that
filters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while
keeping a low test-time computational overhead. For Kernel Density Estimation,
we propose a manifold-aware kernel to model a probability density function for
actions composed of end-effector Cartesian position, orientation, and gripper
state. KDPE overall achieves better performance than Diffusion Policy on
simulated single-arm tasks and real robot experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework (MLM) for six-DoF robotic arm-equipped quadruped robots, enabling them to perform multi-task whole-body loco-manipulation autonomously or through teleoperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of achieving multi-task whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots equipped with robotic arms, including balancing numerous tasks and ensuring robust performance.

Method: Proposed a reinforcement learning framework featuring a trajectory library with adaptive sampling for training and a Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network to predict future trajectories and velocities. Extensive simulation data and curriculum-based rewards were used.

Result: Simulation ablation studies verified the approach's effectiveness, and real-world tests on the Go2 robot equipped with a robotic arm showed strong performance in multi-task execution.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust framework for enabling quadruped robots to achieve multi-task whole-body loco-manipulation with zero-shot real-world transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a
challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address
this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both
real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped
quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks
autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing
multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a
trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This
approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected
trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment
scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of
policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a
Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future
trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and
curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in
simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in
simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while
real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate
the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.

### [316] [Why Report Failed Interactions With Robots?! Towards Vignette-based Interaction Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10603)
*Agnes Axelsson,Merle Reimann,Ronald Cumbal,Hannah Pelikan,Divesh Lala*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of ethnographic vignettes to document failures in human-robot interactions (HRI), emphasizing their potential to improve transparency and evaluation in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have improved human-robot interactions, but systems remain sub-optimal compared to human-human interactions. Failures in HRI systems, especially context-specific and undocumented ones, need better representation and analysis.

Method: The authors propose ethnographic vignettes as a method to highlight failures in HRI. They describe the methodology of writing vignettes and present examples based on personal experiences with failed interactions.

Result: Ethnographic vignettes effectively capture failures, unexpected robot behaviors, and a multi-disciplinary perspective, enhancing transparency in HRI research.

Conclusion: Vignettes are a valuable tool to document and communicate failures in HRI, promote transparency about robotic capabilities, and supplement existing evaluation methods.

Abstract: Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent
of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal
when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of
failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be
generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been
implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique
overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight
these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the
methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on
our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the
strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a
multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of
robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted
from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing
interaction evaluation methods.

### [317] [Synthesis of Deep Neural Networks with Safe Robust Adaptive Control for Reliable Operation of Wheeled Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10634)
*Mehdi Heydari Shahna,Jouni Mattila*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a hierarchical control system combining deep neural networks (DNNs) and robust adaptive control (RAC) for heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) to ensure precise control and safety under disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of deploying black-box DNN control policies for heavy-duty WMRs that must meet strict international standards and handle real-world faults and disturbances.

Method: The authors designed a hierarchical control policy driven by DNNs and monitored by two safety layers. A low-level safety mechanism switches to a RAC policy under disturbances, while a high-level safety layer initiates a shutdown when disturbances are too severe.

Result: The approach guarantees uniform exponential stability and adheres to safety standards. Real-world validation was conducted using a 6,000 kg WMR.

Conclusion: The synthesis of DNN and RAC policies successfully balances robustness and responsiveness, enabling safe operation of heavy-duty WMRs even under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low
computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,
the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty
wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international
standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical
control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with
differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and
deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance
under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach
a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined
threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary
control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)
policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring
stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system
robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a
high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during
operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently
severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would
jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC
policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while
adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg
WMR.

*Carla Wehner,Finn Schubert,Heiko Hellkamp,Julius Hahnewald,Kilian Scheafer,Muhammad Bilal Khan,Oliver Gutfleisch*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an open-source simulation tool tailored for magnetic soft robots, filling gaps in existing software by providing user-friendly real-time deformation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for modeling magnetic soft robots are either incomplete or too complex for users of varying expertise, hindering research and development.

Method: The authors developed a simulation platform based on SOFA that includes features for defining material properties, applying magnetic fields, and analyzing stress in real-time.

Result: Four benchmark models—beam, grippers, and butterfly—were successfully demonstrated to validate the tool's functionality and user accessibility.

Conclusion: The proposed simulation tool simplifies the study and design of magnetic soft robots, with plans for further refinement and experimental validation to ensure accuracy and industry relevance.

Abstract: Soft robots, particularly magnetic soft robots, require specialized
simulation tools to accurately model their deformation under external magnetic
fields. However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic
materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise
levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface
using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed
to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material
properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real
time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it
aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four
benchmark models - a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -
demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible
to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine
accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard
finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of
magnetic soft robots.

*Matteo Luperto,Valerii Stakanov,Giacomo Boracchi,Nicola Basilico,Francesco Amigoni*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to autonomous exploration where robots prioritize parts of unknown environments using neural network-based saliency maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on maximizing the explored area quickly but neglect the importance of discovering impactful regions more efficiently.

Method: The method uses neural networks to generate saliency maps that pinpoint areas critical for exploration, influencing popular exploration strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating saliency maps significantly enhances the robot's exploration behavior.

Conclusion: Saliency maps can refine exploration strategies to target important regions, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a widely studied problem where a robot
incrementally builds a map of a previously unknown environment. The robot
selects the next locations to reach using an exploration strategy. To do so,
the robot has to balance between competing objectives, like exploring the
entirety of the environment, while being as fast as possible. Most exploration
strategies try to maximise the explored area to speed up exploration; however,
they do not consider that parts of the environment are more important than
others, as they lead to the discovery of large unknown areas. We propose a
method that identifies \emph{saliency areas} as those areas that are of high
interest for exploration, by using saliency maps obtained from a neural network
that, given the current map, implements a termination criterion to estimate
whether the environment can be considered fully-explored or not. We use
saliency areas to bias some widely used exploration strategies, showing, with
an extensive experimental campaign, that this knowledge can significantly
influence the behavior of the robot during exploration.

### [320] [Learning Task Execution Hierarchies for Redundant Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10780)
*Alessandro Adami,Aris Synodinos,Matteo Iovino,Ruggero Carli,Pietro Falco*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated framework combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming to learn Stack of Tasks (SoT) hierarchies for redundancy management in robots, validated via simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems often have high redundancy, enabling simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, which necessitates effective management. Traditional manual SoT designs limit adaptability and accessibility.

Method: The framework automatically learns SoT hierarchies and parameters using Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming, guided by a cost function based on precision, safety, and execution time.

Result: The learned SoTs allow robots to adapt dynamically to environmental changes and inputs, ensuring balanced, robust task execution in simulations and experiments on a mobile-YuMi prototype.

Conclusion: The approach enhances redundancy management in complex robots, offering a general, user-friendly solution that reduces reliance on expert design, advancing human-centered programming.

Abstract: Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial
robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform
multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving
reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks
(SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified
framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting
their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework
that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from
user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic
Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies
without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as
precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate
our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a
dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned
SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs,
balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This
approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy
management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and
reducing the need for expert design.

*Troi Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Self, Environment, and Target (SET) Perceptual Factors Framework to systematically analyze how environmental factors impact robot perception, addressing safety and trustworthiness concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from concerns about the reliability of robot perception due to environmental factors, which can compromise decision-making, safety, and public trust.

Method: The paper proposes the SET Perceptual Factors Framework, which uses SET State Trees and SET Factor Trees to categorize and model the impact of factors like weather or sensor limitations on perceptual tasks. Quantification is done using Perceptual Factor Models.

Result: The framework systematically identifies and models how environmental factors affect perceptual tasks, leading to a structured method for quantifying uncertainties.

Conclusion: The framework enhances safety assurances in autonomous systems and fosters public trust by providing a transparent and standardized approach for analyzing perceptual risks.

Abstract: Future autonomous systems promise significant societal benefits, yet their
deployment raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness. A key concern is
assuring the reliability of robot perception, as perception seeds safe
decision-making. Failures in perception are often due to complex yet common
environmental factors and can lead to accidents that erode public trust. To
address this concern, we introduce the SET (Self, Environment, and Target)
Perceptual Factors Framework. We designed the framework to systematically
analyze how factors such as weather, occlusion, or sensor limitations
negatively impact perception. To achieve this, the framework employs SET State
Trees to categorize where such factors originate and SET Factor Trees to model
how these sources and factors impact perceptual tasks like object detection or
pose estimation. Next, we develop Perceptual Factor Models using both trees to
quantify the uncertainty for a given task. Our framework aims to promote
rigorous safety assurances and cultivate greater public understanding and trust
in autonomous systems by offering a transparent and standardized method for
identifying, modeling, and communicating perceptual risks.

*Henry Powell,Guy Laban,Emily S. Cross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a computational model for detecting subjective self-disclosure in human-robot interaction, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in computational modeling of subjective self-disclosure, especially in human interactions with social robots, which is crucial for enhancing their social capabilities.

Method: A custom multimodal attention network is developed and trained on a large self-disclosure video corpus, utilizing a novel loss function called scale preserving cross entropy loss.

Result: The model achieves an F1 score of 0.83, improving by 0.48 over the best baseline model.

Conclusion: The study paves the way for equipping social robots with the ability to detect self-disclosures, a necessary feature for social cognition in human-robot settings.

Abstract: Subjective self-disclosure is an important feature of human social
interaction. While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature
to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure,
little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are
able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to
model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners.
It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction
with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In
this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based
on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a
large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss
function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both
classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that
the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1
score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result
makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an
interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in
social robots with social cognition.

*Yizhi Zhou,Ziwei Kang,Jiawei Xia,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system that enhances localization accuracy by addressing estimator inconsistency in UWB-aided visual-inertial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve localization performance in UWB-aided visual-inertial odometry systems, addressing inconsistencies from system observability issues and neglect of UWB anchor calibration uncertainty.

Method: Proposes a Lie-group-based CVIRO system that includes UWB anchor state in the system state, thereby accounting for calibration uncertainty and maintaining observability consistency through invariant error properties.

Result: The CVIRO method analytically preserves the unobservable subspace and achieves superior localization accuracy and consistency in simulations and experiments compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed CVIRO algorithm effectively mitigates localization inconsistencies and outperforms current methods, proving its significance for improving UWB-aided VIO systems.

Abstract: Ultra Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation
accuracy of a UWBaided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade
localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two
main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system
observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to
improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a
consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system
based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the
system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and
enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states.
Furthermore, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant
error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO
algorithm naturally maintains the system's correct unobservable subspace,
thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and
experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and
consistency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study develops a reinforcement learning framework using A2C to optimize satellite orbital parameters, outperforming PPO in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent challenges such as collision risks and mission-specific requirements in deploying and operating Earth observation satellites amid LEO congestion.

Method: A reinforcement learning approach using the A2C algorithm was applied to optimize orbital parameters. The problem was framed as an MDP in a custom simulation environment based on Keplerian orbital dynamics.

Result: Comparison shows A2C provides 5.8x higher rewards and converges 31.5x faster than PPO, supporting mission objectives efficiently across various scenarios.

Conclusion: The study positions reinforcement learning as a computationally viable option for adaptive and scalable satellite mission planning in LEO environments while showcasing A2C's effectiveness.

Abstract: The increasing congestion of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) poses persistent
challenges to the efficient deployment and safe operation of Earth observation
satellites. Mission planners must now account not only for mission-specific
requirements but also for the increasing collision risk with active satellites
and space debris. This work presents a reinforcement learning framework using
the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm to optimize satellite orbital
parameters for precise terrestrial coverage within predefined surface radii. By
formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom
OpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using
classical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of
the orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right
ascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted
terrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x
higher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer
timesteps (2,000 vs 63,000). The A2C agent consistently meets mission
objectives across diverse target coordinates while maintaining computational
efficiency suitable for real-time mission planning applications. Key
contributions include: (1) a TLE-based orbital simulation environment
incorporating physics constraints, (2) validation of actor-critic methods'
superiority over trust region approaches in continuous orbital control, and (3)
demonstration of rapid convergence enabling adaptive satellite deployment. This
approach establishes reinforcement learning as a computationally efficient
alternative for scalable and intelligent LEO mission planning.

TL;DR: FormalGrad introduces a framework to improve code correctness and robustness generated by LLMs by integrating formal methods and iterative refinement, achieving significant performance improvements on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce code lacking correctness and robustness, especially in domains with strict requirements. FormalGrad aims to address this limitation.

Method: FormalGrad treats code as a differentiable variable and uses structured feedback and formal constraints converted into pseudo-gradients to iteratively refine solutions.

Result: The method outperformed strong baselines with up to 27% improvement on HumanEval and 41% relative improvement on LiveCodeBench V6.

Conclusion: FormalGrad enhances the reliability of AI-generated code in complex domains, offering a robust framework for high-stakes software development.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of
correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains
requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that
integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.
It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured
feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient
guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only
functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on
the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation
outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on
HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.
FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient,
paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes
applications.

*Xiaohan Chen,Zhongying Pan,Quan Feng,Yu Tian,Shuqun Yang,Mengru Wang,Lina Gong,Yuxia Geng,Piji Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The authors present Saracoder, a retrieval framework for code completion that addresses redundancy, semantic misguidance, and ambiguity with novel optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks for repository-level code completion often rely on text similarity, which leads to semantically flawed and ambiguous outcomes.

Method: Saracoder uses hierarchical feature optimization to refine candidate code completions and an identifier disambiguator to address cross-file symbol ambiguity.

Result: Extensive benchmarks show that Saracoder outperforms current solutions in terms of relevance and accuracy across various languages and models.

Conclusion: Refining retrieval results in multiple dimensions improves repository-level code completion systems, offering a robust and accurate solution.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

### [327] [Next Edit Prediction: Learning to Predict Code Edits from Context and Interaction History](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10074)
*Ruofan Lu,Yintong Huo,Meng Zhang,Yichen Li,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces the task of Next Edit Prediction, which predicts a developer's next code edit based on recent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face inefficiencies with current AI coding assistants: code completion is limited to cursor position, and chat-based tools require intent description, causing workflow interruptions.

Method: The researchers curated a supervised fine-tuning dataset and evaluation benchmark for Next Edit Prediction, fine-tuned models, and conducted comprehensive evaluations.

Result: The evaluations resulted in several novel findings regarding the effectiveness of models on the Next Edit Prediction task.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for AI tools to proactively assist developers by anticipating their next actions instead of reacting to explicit commands.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

### [328] [On the synchronization between Hugging Face pre-trained language models and their upstream GitHub repository](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10157)
*Ajibode Adekunle,Abdul Ali Bangash,Bram Adams,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies coordination challenges in managing pretrained language models (PTLMs) across GitHub (GH) and Hugging Face (HF), identifying synchronization patterns and structural disconnects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misaligned release timelines, inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse in the development and distribution of PTLMs between GH and HF.

Method: A mixed-method study analyzing 325 PTLM families and 904 HF variants, focusing on commit activities and synchronization patterns.

Result: Identified eight synchronization patterns, revealing prevalent structural disconnects such as isolated changes and partial synchronizations between GH and HF repositories.

Conclusion: Improving synchronization between GH and HF is vital to ensure complete, updated, and consistent pretrained language models for end users.

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing
(NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like
software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment
scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants
via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development
between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,
inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a
mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit
activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically
make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code
quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the
training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model
descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference.
Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities
between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag
(delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight
distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized
patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals
structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These
patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made
on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases,
indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such
fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally
inconsistent models. Hence, recognizing these synchronization patterns is
critical for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

### [329] [Bridging Solidity Evolution Gaps: An LLM-Enhanced Approach for Smart Contract Compilation Error Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10517)
*Likai Ye,Mengliang Li,Dehai Zhao,Jiamou Sun,Xiaoxue Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study investigates the challenges of Solidity version evolution, showing high compilation error rates. It explores the use of LLMs to mitigate these issues and introduces a novel framework, SMCFIXER, which achieves remarkable accuracy in resolving compilation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent updates to Solidity versions introduce challenges such as compilation errors, code migration, and maintenance, necessitating solutions for effective smart contract adaptation.

Method: The study empirically evaluates various LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3, GPT-4o) for resolving compilation errors, identifies limitations, and develops SMCFIXER, a framework that integrates expert knowledge retrieval and iterative patch generation.

Result: SMCFIXER exhibited a statistically significant 24.24% improvement in compilation error resolution accuracy over baseline methods, achieving a near-perfect accuracy of 96.97%.

Conclusion: Domain-specific frameworks like SMCFIXER, coupled with LLMs, can significantly enhance Solidity migration processes, addressing major challenges faced by developers.

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly
evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and
developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant
challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and
maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the
challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined
contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%
of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version
migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)
and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these
models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes
significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt
engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific
adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that
systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair
mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture
comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts
relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official
documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.
Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our
approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on
real-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.

*Souhaila Serbout,Diana Carolina Muñoz Hurtado,Hassan Atwi,Edoardo Riggio,Cesare Pautasso*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoScat is a scalable tool for visualizing and analyzing large software evolution datasets using interactive scatterplots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of managing and analyzing massive datasets related to software evolution spanning multiple years and artifacts.

Method: Proposes the EvoScat tool, which visualizes data with interactive density scatterplots and allows for flexible configuration of metrics and artifact histories.

Result: EvoScat supports scalable visualizations, artifact metric analysis, history comparisons, and specific use cases such as clone detection and freshness assessment.

Conclusion: The tool enables an in-depth exploration of software evolution datasets and enhances the understanding of artifact histories across open-source repositories.

Abstract: Long lived software projects encompass a large number of artifacts, which
undergo many revisions throughout their history. Empirical software engineering
researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with
millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In
this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal
scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a
global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source
repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers
with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and
characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of
individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different
artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics
associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The
paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of
change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support
for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time
axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of
millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of
software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets
gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow
definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history
of specific popular open source projects.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper unifies diverse analytical approaches in unsupervised learning, network science, imaging, and neuroscience by identifying fundamental equivalences across these fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of integrated analyses and data interpretation in modern scientific fields, and to avoid issues such as circular analyses and redundant explanations.

Method: The authors demonstrate equivalences in clustering, dimensionality reduction, and network analysis methods; equate metrics of connectional attributes and communication measures; and simplify structural and dynamical interpretations using semi-analytical vignettes.

Result: They illustrate the efficacy of these equivalences with brain-imaging data and provide a multi-language toolbox (abct) to implement the proposed analytical methods.

Conclusion: The study advances scientific integration by offering a unified framework across multiple fields, enhancing clarity and interpretability of diverse analyses.

Abstract: Modern scientific fields face the challenge of integrating a wealth of data,
analyses, and results. We recently showed that a neglect of this integration
can lead to circular analyses and redundant explanations. Here, we help advance
scientific integration by describing equivalences that unify diverse analyses
of datasets and networks. We describe equivalences across analyses of
clustering and dimensionality reduction, network centrality and dynamics, and
popular models in imaging and network neuroscience. First, we equate
foundational objectives across unsupervised learning and network science (from
k means to modularity to UMAP), fuse classic algorithms for optimizing these
objectives, and extend these objectives to simplify interpretations of popular
dimensionality reduction methods. Second, we equate basic measures of
connectional magnitude and dispersion with six measures of communication,
control, and diversity in network science and network neuroscience. Third, we
describe three semi-analytical vignettes that clarify and simplify the
interpretation of structural and dynamical analyses in imaging and network
neuroscience. We illustrate our results on example brain-imaging data and
provide abct, an open multi-language toolbox that implements our analyses.
Together, our study unifies diverse analyses across unsupervised learning,
network science, imaging neuroscience, and network neuroscience.

### [332] [An Intelligent Infrastructure as a Foundation for Modern Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10051)
*Satrajit S. Ghosh*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper advocates transforming traditional scientific infrastructure into dynamic AI-driven ecosystems for efficient scientific progress, with neuroscience as a test case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrastructure issues like data silos, inefficiencies, and inability to leverage AI hinder scientific progress, especially in neuroscience with its rapid data growth and clinical importance.

Method: Proposes operational guidelines to pivot infrastructure towards decentralization, self-learning, and seamless AI-human collaboration using neuroscience as a model.

Result: Recommends actionable principles and guidelines that address underfunding, diversity in contributions, and global collaboration to achieve dynamic, intelligent infrastructure.

Conclusion: Shifting to AI-aligned infrastructure can overcome current limitations, promote ethical practices, and accelerate discoveries, benefiting neuroscience and other domains.

Abstract: Infrastructure shapes societies and scientific discovery. Traditional
scientific infrastructure, often static and fragmented, leads to issues like
data silos, lack of interoperability and reproducibility, and unsustainable
short-lived solutions. Our current technical inability and social reticence to
connect and coordinate scientific research and engineering leads to
inefficiencies and impedes progress. With AI technologies changing how we
interact with the world around us, there is an opportunity to transform
scientific processes. Neuroscience's exponential growth of multimodal and
multiscale data, and urgent clinical relevance demand an infrastructure itself
learns, coordinates, and improves. Using neuroscience as a stress test, this
perspective argues for a paradigm shift: infrastructure must evolve into a
dynamic, AI-aligned ecosystem to accelerate science. Building on several
existing principles for data, collective benefit, and digital repositories, I
recommend operational guidelines for implementing them to create this dynamic
ecosystem, aiming to foster a decentralized, self-learning, and self-correcting
system where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly. Addressing the chronic
underfunding of scientific infrastructure, acknowledging diverse contributions
beyond publications, and coordinating global efforts are critical steps for
this transformation. By prioritizing an intelligent infrastructure as a central
scientific instrument for knowledge generation, we can overcome current
limitations, accelerate discovery, ensure reproducibility and ethical
practices, and ultimately translate neuroscientific understanding into tangible
societal benefits, setting a blueprint for other scientific domains.

### [333] [Large Language Models Show Signs of Alignment with Human Neurocognition During Abstract Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10057)
*Christopher Pinier,Sonia Acuña Vargas,Mariia Steeghs-Turchina,Dora Matzke,Claire E. Stevenson,Michael D. Nunez*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study examines if large language models (LLMs) mirror human brain mechanisms during abstract reasoning using task performance and neural representation comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if there are shared principles of abstract reasoning between biological intelligence (human brain) and artificial intelligence (LLMs).

Method: The authors compared the performance and neural representations of humans and eight open-source LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task, analyzing fixation-related potentials (FRPs) recorded via EEG.

Result: The largest LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieved human-comparable accuracy and exhibited similar representations of abstraction, clustering patterns within intermediate layers. Some correlations were observed between LLM and human frontal FRPs.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that LLMs may share representational spaces and mechanisms of abstract reasoning with the human brain, indicating potential shared principles between biological and artificial cognition.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) mirror human
neurocognition during abstract reasoning. We compared the performance and
neural representations of human participants with those of eight open-source
LLMs on an abstract-pattern-completion task. We leveraged pattern type
differences in task performance and in fixation-related potentials (FRPs) as
recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during the task. Our findings indicate
that only the largest tested LLMs (~70 billion parameters) achieve
human-comparable accuracy, with Qwen-2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-70B also showing
similarities with the human pattern-specific difficulty profile. Critically,
every LLM tested forms representations that distinctly cluster the abstract
pattern categories within their intermediate layers, although the strength of
this clustering scales with their performance on the task. Moderate positive
correlations were observed between the representational geometries of
task-optimal LLM layers and human frontal FRPs. These results consistently
diverged from comparisons with other EEG measures (response-locked ERPs and
resting EEG), suggesting a potential shared representational space for abstract
patterns. This indicates that LLMs might mirror human brain mechanisms in
abstract reasoning, offering preliminary evidence of shared principles between
biological and artificial intelligence.

### [334] [Excessive Screen Time is Associated with Mental Health Problems and ADHD in US Children and Adolescents: Physical Activity and Sleep as Parallel Mediators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10062)
*Ying Dai,Na Ouyang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Excessive screen time (≥4 hours daily) during the pandemic was linked to increased risks of anxiety, depression, behavioral problems, and ADHD among U.S. children and adolescents, with physical activity, irregular bedtime, and insufficient sleep being mediators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to investigate how screen time affected mental health (anxiety, depression, behavior, and ADHD) in children and adolescents during the pandemic, and whether physical activity, sleep, and bedtime regularity mediates these associations.

Method: Data from 50,231 U.S. children and adolescents aged 6–17 were analyzed from the 2020–2021 National Survey of Children’s Health, utilizing natural effect models and structural equation modeling to assess mediation effects.

Result: Screen time exceeding 4 hours daily was associated with heightened risks of anxiety, depression, behavior problems, and ADHD. Mediation analysis revealed physical activity accounted for 30.2%-39.3% of this association, irregular bedtime for 18.2%-25.7%, and short sleep duration for 2.77%-7.34%.

Conclusion: Excessive screen time negatively impacts mental and behavioral health. Promoting physical activity, regular sleep routines, and sufficient sleep can mitigate these risks.

Abstract: To examine associations between screen time and anxiety, depression, behavior
or conduct problems, and ADHD among children and adolescents during the
pandemic, and to assess whether physical activity, sleep duration, and bedtime
regularity mediate these associations. Data from 50231 US children and
adolescents aged 6 to 17 years in the 2020 to 2021 National Survey of Childrens
Health were analyzed. Exact natural effect models and structural equation
modeling assessed mediation by physical activity, short sleep duration, and
irregular bedtime. We found that daily screen time equal or more than 4 hours
was linked to higher risks of anxiety (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.32, 1.58),
depression (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.41, 1.93), behavior or conduct problems (aOR =
1.17, 95% CI 1.05, 1.30), and ADHD (aOR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11, 1.33). Physical
activity accounted for 30.2% to 39.3% of the association, irregular bedtime for
18.2% to 25.7%, and short sleep duration for 2.77% to 7.34%. Excessive screen
time was associated with poorer mental health and ADHD, partly explained by
reduced physical activity, irregular bedtime, and insufficient sleep.
Interventions should promote physical activity, regular sleep routines, and
adequate sleep duration to effectively mitigate mental health issues and ADHD
among children and adolescents.

### [335] [Dynamical Alignment: A Principle for Adaptive Neural Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10064)
*Xia Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of 'Dynamical Alignment,' showing that a fixed neural structure can achieve diverse computational modes by leveraging input signal dynamics. This provides insights into the underperformance of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and demonstrates their potential to outperform standard artificial neural networks when operated dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of viewing neural network capabilities solely through static architecture, aiming to explore the dynamic computation principles that leverage temporal input dynamics.

Method: The authors introduce 'Dynamical Alignment,' a concept wherein fixed neural structures utilize input signal dynamics to achieve different computational modes. They analyze the optimization landscape of spiking neural networks and study how phase space volume dynamics govern their modes of operation.

Result: The study finds that SNNs can operate in two computational modes: 'dissipative' (energy-efficient sparse coding) and 'expansive' (unlocking high representational power). Through alignment of input dynamics with neuronal timescales, SNNs match or outperform artificial neural networks on tasks such as classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.

Conclusion: The findings suggest a paradigm shift in AI from designing static architectures to mastering dynamic computation principles. This approach unifies concepts in neuroscience and emphasizes the potential of software-controlled, hardware-fixed systems for advanced computation.

Abstract: The computational capabilities of a neural network are widely assumed to be
determined by its static architecture. Here we challenge this view by
establishing that a fixed neural structure can operate in fundamentally
different computational modes, driven not by its structure but by the temporal
dynamics of its input signals. We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.
  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing
paradox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By
encoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a
bimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by
phase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting
dynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes. In
contrast, an 'expansive' mode, driven by expanding dynamics, unlocks the
representational power required for SNNs to match or even exceed their
artificial neural network counterparts on diverse tasks, including
classification, reinforcement learning, and cognitive integration.
  We find this computational advantage emerges from a timescale alignment
between input dynamics and neuronal integration. This principle, in turn,
offers a unified, computable perspective on long-observed dualities in
neuroscience, from stability-plasticity dilemma to segregation-integration
dynamic. It demonstrates that computation in both biological and artificial
systems can be dynamically sculpted by 'software' on fixed 'hardware', pointing
toward a potential paradigm shift for AI research: away from designing complex
static architectures and toward mastering adaptive, dynamic computation
principles.

*Shamaley Aravinthan,Bin Hu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study examines the connection between GFAP levels and acute speech disruption after brain injury, using simulated data to propose integrated diagnostic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how GFAP (a biomarker for brain injury) and speech anomalies are connected, potentially enabling faster injury triage.

Method: Simulated 200 virtual patient data points varying by lesion location, onset time, and severity, while modeling GFAP kinetics and speech anomalies. Machine learning and causal inference methods were applied.

Result: GFAP levels correlated with speech anomalies' severity, with integrated biochemical-voice models outperforming GFAP or speech-only models in classification of injury severity.

Conclusion: Biochemical (GFAP) and voice diagnostics show promise for early brain injury detection, particularly for cortical injuries, but require clinical validation.

Abstract: Background: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a biomarker for
intracerebral hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, but its link to acute
speech disruption is untested. Speech anomalies often emerge early after
injury, enabling rapid triage.
  Methods: We simulated a cohort of 200 virtual patients stratified by lesion
location, onset time, and severity. GFAP kinetics followed published
trajectories; speech anomalies were generated from lesion-specific
neurophysiological mappings. Ensemble machine-learning models used GFAP,
speech, and lesion features; robustness was tested under noise, delays, and
label dropout. Causal inference (inverse probability of treatment weighting and
targeted maximum likelihood estimation) estimated directional associations
between GFAP elevation and speech severity.
  Findings: GFAP correlated with simulated speech anomaly severity (Spearman
rho = 0.48), strongest for cortical lesions (rho = 0.55). Voice anomalies
preceded detectable GFAP rise by a median of 42 minutes in cortical injury.
Classifier area under the curve values were 0.74 (GFAP only), 0.78 (voice
only), and 0.86 for the fused multimodal model, which showed higher sensitivity
in mild or ambiguous cases. Causal estimates indicated higher GFAP increased
the modeled probability of moderate-to-severe speech anomalies by 32 to 35
percent, independent of lesion site and onset time.
  Conclusion: These results support a link between GFAP elevation and speech
anomalies in acute brain injury and suggest integrated biochemical-voice
diagnostics could improve early triage, especially for cortical injury.
Findings are simulation-based and require validation in prospective clinical
studies with synchronized GFAP assays and speech recordings.

TL;DR: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge involved predicting fMRI responses to multimodal movie stimuli, with validation based on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge aims to push computational neuroscience forward by creating models that predict human brain activity accurately using naturalistic movie stimuli.

Method: Participants used training data from fMRI responses to 65 hours of movie stimuli and competed by predicting responses to unseen data, including 6 out-of-distribution films.

Result: Winners were determined by their ability to predict brain activity for held-out movie sets. The MedARC team placed 4th, and top team reports are now publicly available.

Conclusion: The challenge highlighted effective computational approaches for brain encoding, providing insights into the field's progress and setting the stage for future improvements.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge just wrapped up a few weeks ago. It is a
biennial challenge in computational neuroscience in which teams attempt to
build models that predict human brain activity from carefully curated stimuli.
Previous editions (2019, 2021, 2023) focused on still images and short videos;
the 2025 edition, which concluded last month (late July), pushed the field
further by using long, multimodal movies. Teams were tasked with predicting
fMRI responses across 1,000 whole-brain parcels across four participants in the
dataset who were scanned while watching nearly 80 hours of naturalistic movie
stimuli. These recordings came from the CNeuroMod project and included 65 hours
of training data, about 55 hours of Friends (seasons 1-6) plus four feature
films (The Bourne Supremacy, Hidden Figures, Life, and The Wolf of Wall
Street). The remaining data were used for validation: Season 7 of Friends for
in-distribution tests, and the final winners for the Challenge were those who
could best predict brain activity for six films in their held-out
out-of-distribution (OOD) set. The winners were just announced and the top team
reports are now publicly available. As members of the MedARC team which placed
4th in the competition, we reflect on the approaches that worked, what they
reveal about the current state of brain encoding, and what might come next.

*Jyotishka Datta,Nicholas G. Polson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper extends the prediction-powered inference (PPI) framework for statistical inference to account for informative labeling, using an inverse probability weighted (IPW) correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the PPI framework so it remains statistically valid when labeling probabilities vary across units.

Method: The method involves replacing PPI's unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) adjustment, leveraging Horvitz-Thompson or Hájek forms.

Result: The extended PPI with IPW adjustments performs well in simulations even when labeling probabilities are estimated rather than known, maintaining both nominal coverage and variance reduction.

Conclusion: By integrating IPW weighting, this paper bridges classical survey sampling techniques with modern prediction-based inference, leading to robust estimators in settings with non-uniform labeling probabilities.

Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) is a recent framework for valid
statistical inference with partially labeled data, combining model-based
predictions on a large unlabeled set with bias correction from a smaller
labeled subset. We show that PPI can be extended to handle informative labeling
by replacing its unweighted bias-correction term with an inverse probability
weighted (IPW) version, using the classical Horvitz--Thompson or H\'ajek forms.
This connection unites design-based survey sampling ideas with modern
prediction-assisted inference, yielding estimators that remain valid when
labeling probabilities vary across units. We consider the common setting where
the inclusion probabilities are not known but estimated from a correctly
specified model. In simulations, the performance of IPW-adjusted PPI with
estimated propensities closely matches the known-probability case, retaining
both nominal coverage and the variance-reduction benefits of PPI.

*Kennon Stewart*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper adapts machine unlearning from static to online settings, achieving improved efficiency and longevity for ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ML pipelines need to address real-world scenarios involving continuous data streams, rather than relying on the static, i.i.d training environments assumed by traditional machine unlearning research.

Method: The authors redefine batch unlearning for online contexts by introducing regret, sample complexity, and deletion capacity metrics, trimming regret bounds to logarithmic levels using improved optimization techniques.

Result: The paper achieves logarithmic ($\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$) regret bounds, minimizes computational complexity via online L-BFGS optimization, and reduces memory costs scaling over time.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches enable more efficient and sustainable unlearning processes in dynamic ML environments, extending a model's lifespan before requiring retraining.

Abstract: Machine unlearning work assumes a static, i.i.d training environment that
doesn't truly exist. Modern ML pipelines need to learn, unlearn, and predict
continuously on production streams of data. We translate the notion of the
batch unlearning scenario to the online setting using notions of regret, sample
complexity, and deletion capacity. We further tighten regret bounds to a
logarithmic $\mathcal{O}(\ln{T})$, a first for a machine unlearning algorithm.
And we swap out an expensive Hessian inversion with online variant of L-BFGS
optimization, removing a memory footprint that scales linearly with time. Such
changes extend the lifespan of an ML model before expensive retraining, making
for a more efficient unlearning process.

*Galen Reeves*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper provides finite-sample bounds for generalized first-order iterative algorithms like gradient-based methods and AMP, using Gaussian matrices and non-separable nonlinearities. It constructs a coupling with a Gaussian process for precise predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing AMP and gradient-based methods analyses, which often rely on asymptotics, separability, or restrictive conditions.

Method: Using a direct comparison between generalized first-order methods and a conditionally Gaussian process, combined with deterministic state evolution recursion for tight dimension-free bounds.

Result: Achieved tight, dimension-free bounds with mild Lipschitz and moment-matching conditions; a lower bound on Wasserstein distance highlights the sharpness of the bounds.

Conclusion: Unified, non-asymptotic approach improves AMP theory, offering sharp predictions and addressing classical limitations without reliance on separability or asymptotics.

Abstract: We establish non-asymptotic bounds on the finite-sample behavior of
generalized first-order iterative algorithms -- including gradient-based
optimization methods and approximate message passing (AMP) -- with Gaussian
data matrices and full-memory, non-separable nonlinearities. The central result
constructs an explicit coupling between the iterates of a generalized
first-order method and a conditionally Gaussian process whose covariance
evolves deterministically via a finite-dimensional state evolution recursion.
This coupling yields tight, dimension-free bounds under mild Lipschitz and
moment-matching conditions. Our analysis departs from classical inductive AMP
proofs by employing a direct comparison between the generalized first-order
method and the conditionally Gaussian comparison process. This approach
provides a unified derivation of AMP theory for Gaussian matrices without
relying on separability or asymptotics. A complementary lower bound on the
Wasserstein distance demonstrates the sharpness of our upper bounds.

### [341] [An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879)
*Johanna Düngler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel algorithm for Differentially Private Stochastic PCA that efficiently estimates the top k eigenvectors of a covariance matrix while achieving improved privacy and statistical utility guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address shortcomings in existing methods for DP Stochastic PCA, such as high sample requirements and excessive noise problems, especially for estimating subspaces with dimensions larger than k=1.

Method: The paper proposes an algorithm capable of estimating top k eigenvectors for arbitrary k≤d, achieving near-optimal error rates and scaling efficiently with sample size, even matching lower bounds for its guarantees.

Result: The algorithm matches statistical utility guarantees for k=1 and demonstrates experimentally competitive advantages for general k in comparison to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm overcomes major limitations of previous DP PCA methods, expanding their applicability for higher-dimensional subspaces while maintaining strong privacy and utility.

Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share
a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private
Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the
largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy
(DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample
size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian
assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when
the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed
these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector
($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of
estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming
both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees
of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n =
\tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k > 1$, matching
our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the
advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.

### [342] [Conic Formulations of Transport Metrics for Unbalanced Measure Networks and Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10888)
*Mary Chriselda Antony Oliver,Emmanuel Hartman,Tom Needham*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel formulation for the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance, which is applied to generalized network and hypernetwork structures, improving robustness, computational efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gromov-Wasserstein distance faces limitations like sensitivity to outliers and restriction to measures of equal mass. This paper aims to address these issues and expand its applicability to more complex structures.

Method: The CGW metric is reformulated using semi-couplings and extended beyond metric measure spaces. A block coordinate ascent algorithm is proposed for computational efficiency.

Result: Fundamental properties of the CGW metric were established alongside bounds for robustness, and computational scalability was validated with experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The new formulation enables broader applications and improves robustness, scalability, and efficiency, making the CGW metric a valuable tool for comparing structured datasets.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) variant of optimal transport, designed to compare
probability densities defined over distinct metric spaces, has emerged as an
important tool for the analysis of data with complex structure, such as
ensembles of point clouds or networks. To overcome certain limitations, such as
the restriction to comparisons of measures of equal mass and sensitivity to
outliers, several unbalanced or partial transport relaxations of the GW
distance have been introduced in the recent literature. This paper is concerned
with the Conic Gromov-Wasserstein (CGW) distance introduced by
S\'{e}journ\'{e}, Vialard, and Peyr\'{e}. We provide a novel formulation in
terms of semi-couplings, and extend the framework beyond the metric measure
space setting, to compare more general network and hypernetwork structures.
With this new formulation, we establish several fundamental properties of the
CGW metric, including its scaling behavior under dilation, variational
convergence in the limit of volume growth constraints, and comparison bounds
with established optimal transport metrics. We further derive quantitative
bounds that characterize the robustness of the CGW metric to perturbations in
the underlying measures. The hypernetwork formulation of CGW admits a simple
and provably convergent block coordinate ascent algorithm for its estimation,
and we demonstrate the computational tractability and scalability of our
approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world high-dimensional and
structured datasets.

Main category: q-bio.MN

TL;DR: The study focuses on the anti-cancer potential of compounds in Garcinia cowa, analyzing their effects using network pharmacology and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the anti-cancer properties of bioactive compounds from Garcinia cowa and understand the molecular mechanisms involved.

Method: Network pharmacology was employed to identify bioactive compounds and target proteins, while the Graph Attention Network algorithm predicted compound activity. Molecular docking was also conducted to study cytotoxic effects on cancer cells.

Result: Key compounds and their target proteins were identified, with MTOR emerging as a potential therapeutic target. Machine learning achieved high predictive performance for compound efficacy.

Conclusion: Garcinia cowa holds promise for anti-cancer therapies through its active compounds, specifically targeting MTOR in cancer cells.

Abstract: Cancer is recognized as a complex group of diseases, contributing to the
highest global mortality rates, with increasing prevalence and a trend toward
affecting younger populations. It is characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation of abnormal cells, invasion of adjacent tissues, and metastasis
to distant organs. Garcinia cowa, a traditional medicinal plant widely used in
Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, is employed to treat fever, cough,
indigestion, as a laxative, and for parasitic diseases. Numerous xanthone
compounds isolated from this species exhibit a broad spectrum of biological
activities, with some showing promise as anti cancer and antimalarial agents.
Network pharmacology analysis successfully identified key bioactive compounds
Rubraxanthone, Garcinone D, Norcowanin, Cowanol, and Cowaxanthone alongside
their primary protein targets (TNF, CTNNB1, SRC, NFKB1, and MTOR), providing
critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying their anti-cancer
effects. The Graph Attention Network algorithm demonstrated superior predictive
performance, achieving an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 0.02 after data
augmentation, highlighting its accuracy in predicting pIC50 values for xanthone
based compounds. Additionally, molecular docking revealed MTOR as a potential
target for inducing cytotoxicity in HeLa cancer cells from Garcinia cowa.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates machine-learned potentials for biomolecular simulations and highlights challenges such as dataset composition and evaluation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application and limitations of universal machine-learned potentials in biomolecular simulations, which promise transferable accuracy.

Method: Equivariant message-passing architectures were trained on the SPICE-v2 dataset. Simulations and benchmarks included various molecular systems and properties, focusing on model size and electrostatics treatments.

Result: Larger models improve benchmark accuracy but inconsistently affect simulation properties. Training dataset composition influences predicted properties. Long-range electrostatics impact conformational variability in Trp-cage but show no systematic effects elsewhere.

Conclusion: Universal machine-learned potentials face challenges due to imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation methods, limiting their reliability for biomolecular simulations.

Abstract: Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

*Adam E. Essex,Natalia B. Janson,Rachel A. Norris,Alexander G. Balanov*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: This paper investigates how artificial neural networks (ANNs) learn and forget by analyzing the mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield network using bifurcation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding memory formation and catastrophic forgetting in ANNs is crucial, as these phenomena hinder reliable learning and adaptability.

Method: The researchers apply bifurcation analysis to reveal how memory attractors and their basin boundaries form in a Hopfield network during Hebbian learning.

Result: They identify pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations as mechanisms driving the creation and destruction of attractors, coding true or spurious memories, and catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The study provides a universal analysis strategy for high-dimensional ANNs, offering insights to address memory handling issues and improve their reliability.

Abstract: Despite explosive expansion of artificial intelligence based on artificial
neural networks (ANNs), these are employed as "black boxes'', as it is unclear
how, during learning, they form memories or develop unwanted features,
including spurious memories and catastrophic forgetting. Much research is
available on isolated aspects of learning ANNs, but due to their high
dimensionality and non-linearity, their comprehensive analysis remains a
challenge. In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in
attractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we
comprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield
network undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to
formation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show
that, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce
a pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new
attractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an
abrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful
learning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point
attractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With
this, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same
mechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal
and applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of
memory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of
a wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to
mitigate their flaws.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve personalized product search ranking by efficiently integrating diverse data sources and optimizing relevance labeling.

Method: The approach combines tabular and non-tabular data, fine-tunes TinyBERT for semantic embeddings, employs a novel sampling technique, and utilizes multi-task learning for ranking optimization.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed model improves ranking performance, supported by ablation studies highlighting the benefits of fine-tuning TinyBERT and incorporating relevance labels.

Conclusion: The presented model significantly enhances personalized product search ranking, demonstrating the potential of multi-task learning and advanced embedding techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

*Michael Weiss,Robert Rosenbach,Christian Eggenberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper compares optimizing for Click-Through Rate (CTR) versus Order-Submit-Rate (OSR) in e-commerce recommendations, showing OSR results in significantly greater business value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to identify the most effective recommendation objective (CTR vs. OSR) to enhance business metrics like Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).

Method: The study involves an online A/B test comparing outcomes of optimizing recommendations based on CTR and OSR.

Result: Optimizing for OSR led to more than a five-fold GMV increase compared to CTR, without compromising new product discovery.

Conclusion: Focusing on OSR as a ranking objective is more advantageous for achieving e-commerce business goals than focusing on CTR, as it leads to stronger GMV growth while preserving other benefits.

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate
(CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and
Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in
e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training
data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large
quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a
generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more
directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value
(GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these
objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate
that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five
times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product
discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature
importances for each of the objectives.

*Ze Liu,Xianquan Wang,Shuochen Liu,Jie Ma,Huibo Xu,Yupeng Han,Zhe Yang,Kai Zhang,Longfei Li,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents "CrossDenoise," a denoising framework for recommender systems aimed at mitigating noise from implicit feedback, leading to significant improvements in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems face substantial performance degradation due to noisy implicit feedback, with existing denoising methods suffering from inefficiency, computational cost, or complex hyperparameter requirements.

Method: The proposed method, CrossDenoise, uses entity-specific reputation factors for users and items and combines these with interaction-level weights via ECDF. It is lightweight, model-agnostic, and uses two intuitive hyperparameters.

Result: Experiments on datasets like ML-1M, Yelp, and Amazon-book show that CrossDenoise outperforms current baselines in various models with up to 27.01% NDCG@50 improvement while adding minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: CrossDenoise offers an efficient, robust, and easily applicable denoising solution for recommender systems, effectively addressing the noisy data problem with scalable performance gains.

Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently
noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation
accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,
suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter
tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a
novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by
disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific
factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity
in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation
factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average
training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an
empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This
design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two
intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and
Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that
CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with
NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our
analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy
samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a
practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

*Andrea Urgolo,Monika Stipsitz,Helios Sanchis-Alepuz*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes using machine learning-based virtual sensing to estimate the degradation state of solder layers in IGBT modules, achieving high accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability and longevity of IGBT modules are crucial for safety-critical and high-performance applications, but direct measurement of internal degradation indicators is challenging.

Method: Synthetic data generation is used to train machine learning algorithms to estimate solder layer degradation and temperature maps based on limited physical sensor readings.

Result: The method achieves 1.17% mean absolute error in estimating degraded solder areas and reproduces the surface temperature with a maximum relative error of 4.56%.

Conclusion: Machine learning-based virtual sensing is a viable and accurate approach to monitor IGBT module degradation, offering an effective solution where direct sensor access is not possible.

Abstract: Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power
electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance
applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such
as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging
due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh
environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a
promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the
relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of
estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full
temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on
synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the
estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are
able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative
error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

Conclusion: DeepCSI proves to be a powerful, efficient, and versatile framework for inverse scattering problems, offering a universal modeling solution for diverse and complex measurement conditions. Its integration of deep learning and physics-informed constraints enhances accuracy while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and
medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse
measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast
source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium
reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast
source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer
perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of
interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the
nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the
computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium
parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that
integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation
regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint
optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with
conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and
universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including
phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments
demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under

Motivation: Accurate cloud detection is crucial for atmospheric studies, climate research, and weather forecasting, necessitating efficient automated methods using satellite data.

Method: The study applies SVM combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection for dimensionality reduction, using infrared radiances or brightness temperatures for cloud classification.

Result: The proposed approach achieved 88.30% agreement with reference labels and aligned well with MODIS cloud masks, but showed discrepancies in polar regions due to differences between sensors.

Conclusion: The CISVM method is robust, efficient, and adaptable for operational cloud classification tasks and can support future satellite missions like the FORUM initiative.

Abstract: Cloud detection is essential for atmospheric retrievals, climate studies, and

Analysis (PCA) and cloud-sensitive channel selection to focus on the most
informative features. Our best configuration achieves 88.30 percent agreement
with reference labels and shows strong consistency with cloud masks from the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with the largest
discrepancies in polar regions due to sensor differences.

*Greg Sadler,Nathan Sherburn*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses "Legal Zero-Days," overlooked vulnerabilities in legal systems that advanced AI could exploit, leading to societal disruption without legal challenges. It presents a risk model and case study to assess their significance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to highlight a previously unaddressed risk vector—legal loopholes—that advanced AI systems could exploit to bypass safeguards and cause governance issues.

Method: They propose a risk model and create "legal puzzles" as evaluation tools to test AI systems' ability to identify legal vulnerabilities. The 2017 Australian dual citizenship crisis serves as a case study.

Result: Current AI systems lack the capability to discover impactful Legal Zero-Days reliably, but future systems might develop this ability, posing both risks and benefits.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of addressing potential legal vulnerabilities in anticipation of advancing AI systems to reduce societal risks and strengthen legal frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of "Legal Zero-Days" as a novel risk vector for
advanced AI systems. Legal Zero-Days are previously undiscovered
vulnerabilities in legal frameworks that, when exploited, can cause immediate
and significant societal disruption without requiring litigation or other
processes before impact. We present a risk model for identifying and evaluating
these vulnerabilities, demonstrating their potential to bypass safeguards or
impede government responses to AI incidents. Using the 2017 Australian dual
citizenship crisis as a case study, we illustrate how seemingly minor legal
oversights can lead to large-scale governance disruption. We develop a
methodology for creating "legal puzzles" as evaluation instruments for
assessing AI systems' capabilities to discover such vulnerabilities. Our
findings suggest that while current AI models may not reliably find impactful
Legal Zero-Days, future systems may develop this capability, presenting both
risks and opportunities for improving legal robustness. This work contributes
to the broader effort to identify and mitigate previously unrecognized risks
from frontier AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper explores how NLP practitioners in the U.S. perceive and address equity issues, highlighting tensions between commercial objectives and fairness. It recommends participatory and accountable data practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand how NLP practitioners approach equity in data-related tasks, as previous research has largely focused on algorithmic bias instead of practitioner perspectives.

Method: The authors conducted a 2024 questionnaire and focus group with U.S.-based NLP data practitioners, linking findings to an AI governance framework.

Result: The study found persistent conflicts between commercial goals and equity efforts. Practitioners emphasized the need for participatory and accountable workflows, addressing both data diversity and systemic governance challenges.

Conclusion: Achieving equity in NLP requires structural governance reforms that empower practitioners and ensure informed community involvement.

Abstract: While research has focused on surfacing and auditing algorithmic bias to
ensure equitable AI development, less is known about how NLP practitioners -
those directly involved in dataset development, annotation, and deployment -
perceive and navigate issues of NLP data equity. This study is among the first
to center practitioners' perspectives, linking their experiences to a
multi-scalar AI governance framework and advancing participatory
recommendations that bridge technical, policy, and community domains. Drawing
on a 2024 questionnaire and focus group, we examine how U.S.-based NLP data
practitioners conceptualize fairness, contend with organizational and systemic
constraints, and engage emerging governance efforts such as the U.S. AI Bill of
Rights. Findings reveal persistent tensions between commercial objectives and
equity commitments, alongside calls for more participatory and accountable data
workflows. We critically engage debates on data diversity and diversity
washing, arguing that improving NLP equity requires structural governance
reforms that support practitioner agency and community consent.

filtering problem and the approximation of an unnormalized filtering density
using the well-known deep BSDE method and neural networks. The method is
trained offline, which means that it can be applied online with new
observations. A mixed a priori-a posteriori error bound is proved under an
elliptic condition. The theoretical convergence rate is confirmed in two
numerical examples.

### [356] [Differential Physiological Responses to Proxemic and Facial Threats in Virtual Avatar Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10586)
*Birgit Nierula,Mustafa Tevfik Lafci,Anna Melnik,Mert Akgül,Farelle Toumaleu Siewe,Sebastian Bosse*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores how virtual avatars' behavior, including personal space intrusions and facial expressions, affect physiological and subjective responses in VR settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how threatening facial expressions and different phases of personal space violations influence physiological and subjective responses in virtual reality.

Method: Sixteen participants experienced a controlled VR setup with a 2x2 factorial design varying personal space intrusion and facial expressions while physiological measures like SCR and HRV and subjective discomfort ratings were recorded.

Result: Standing phase violations elicited higher physiological arousal than the approach phase, angry facial expressions reduced HRV and increased discomfort but did not amplify SCR results.

Conclusion: Distinct physiological responses are associated with spatial violations and facial threats. The research aids in developing advanced multi-modal assessments and enhancing avatar interactions in VR environments.

Abstract: Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social
interaction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications.
While previous research has established that users respond to personal space
violations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific
physiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain
understudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to
personal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening
facial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence
these responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design
manipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression
(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart
rate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were
individually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR
responses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the
approach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged
proximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing
than the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,
reflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort
ratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that
different physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic
responses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV
responds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing
comprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual
environments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ParseJargon, an AI-powered tool to overcome jargon barriers in workplace communication, demonstrating its effectiveness over non-personalized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific jargon often hampers interdisciplinary communication in professional settings, motivating the need for effective jargon management strategies.

Method: The study involved a diary examination of professionals, design and implementation of an interactive LLM system, followed by controlled experiments and a field study of the system's performance.

Result: ParseJargon significantly improved comprehension, engagement, and appreciation in workplace communication compared to non-personalized tools, while personalized support proved superior to general-purpose alternatives.

Conclusion: The research highlights the benefits of personalized jargon support and suggests valuable applications in interdisciplinary and educational contexts, though practical deployment challenges exist.

Abstract: Effective interdisciplinary communication is frequently hindered by
domain-specific jargon. To explore the jargon barriers in-depth, we conducted a
formative diary study with 16 professionals, revealing critical limitations in
current jargon-management strategies during workplace meetings. Based on these
insights, we designed ParseJargon, an interactive LLM-powered system providing
real-time personalized jargon identification and explanations tailored to
users' individual backgrounds. A controlled experiment comparing ParseJargon
against baseline (no support) and general-purpose (non-personalized) conditions
demonstrated that personalized jargon support significantly enhanced
participants' comprehension, engagement, and appreciation of colleagues' work,
whereas general-purpose support negatively affected engagement. A follow-up
field study validated ParseJargon's usability and practical value in real-time
meetings, highlighting both opportunities and limitations for real-world
deployment. Our findings contribute insights into designing personalized jargon
support tools, with implications for broader interdisciplinary and educational
applications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in conducting longitudinal research on user interactions with AI and proposes a workshop to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To emphasize the importance of capturing the evolving dynamics of user interactions with AI over time, which current one-time evaluations fail to do.

Method: A workshop involving keynote speeches, panel discussions, breakout groups, and hands-on activities to develop strategies, protocols, and tools for longitudinal studies.

Result: The workshop aims to equip researchers with strategies for longitudinal research and foster a community in this area.

Conclusion: Promoting longitudinal studies as an essential approach for evaluating AI tools and encouraging community-building around this methodology.

Abstract: UIST researchers develop tools to address user challenges. However, user
interactions with AI evolve over time through learning, adaptation, and
repurposing, making one time evaluations insufficient. Capturing these dynamics
requires longer-term studies, but challenges in deployment, evaluation design,
and data collection have made such longitudinal research difficult to
implement. Our workshop aims to tackle these challenges and prepare researchers
with practical strategies for longitudinal studies. The workshop includes a
keynote, panel discussions, and interactive breakout groups for discussion and
hands-on protocol design and tool prototyping sessions. We seek to foster a
community around longitudinal system research and promote it as a more embraced
method for designing, building, and evaluating UIST tools.

Result: Achieved accurate symptom decoding of Parkinson's disease using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation without patient-specific training.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully demonstrates the potential for generalized neural state estimation in closed-loop neuromodulation therapies.

Abstract: Neural decoding of pathological and physiological states can enable
patient-individualized closed-loop neuromodulation therapy. Recent advances in
pre-trained large-scale foundation models offer the potential for generalized
state estimation without patient-individual training. Here we present a
foundation model trained on chronic longitudinal deep brain stimulation
recordings spanning over 24 days. Adhering to long time-scale symptom
fluctuations, we highlight the extended context window of 30 minutes. We
present an optimized pre-training loss function for neural electrophysiological
data that corrects for the frequency bias of common masked auto-encoder loss
functions due to the 1-over-f power law. We show in a downstream task the
decoding of Parkinson's disease symptoms with leave-one-subject-out
cross-validation without patient-individual training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCP2OSC, a server enabling precise control of OpenSoundControl (OSC) parameters using natural language prompts, combining the ease of text input with fine control traditionally available via knobs and sliders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text prompts are intuitive but lack precision, whereas knobs and sliders allow fine adjustments but are complex. There's a need to bridge this gap for more intuitive and precise control mechanisms.

Method: The study presents the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with unique prompt design criteria. It demonstrates 14 QA examples using generalized prompt templates to show how natural language prompts can manage OSC tasks such as generating, validating, debugging, and visualizing OSC messages.

Result: Claude, integrated with the MCP2OSC server, proved effective in handling intricate OSC tasks, enhancing human-machine collaboration by combining LLM capabilities with intuitive human interfaces.

Conclusion: MCP2OSC offers a novel approach to creative applications at the protocol level, leveraging LLM to enable intuitive and precise controls for multimedia devices and showcasing potential for a universal, LLM-based control system.

Abstract: Text prompts enable intuitive content creation but may fall short in
achieving high precision for intricate tasks; knob or slider controls offer
precise adjustments at the cost of increased complexity. To address the gap
between knobs and prompts, a new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a
unique set of prompt design criteria are presented to enable exploring
parametric OSC (OpenSoundControl) control by natural language prompts.
Demonstrated by 14 practical QA examples with best practices and the
generalized prompt templates, this study finds Claude integrated with the
MCP2OSC server effective in generating OSC messages by natural language,
interpreting, searching, and visualizing OSC messages, validating and debugging
OSC messages, and managing OSC address patterns. MCP2OSC enhances human-machine
collaboration by leveraging LLM (Large Language Model) to handle intricate OSC
development tasks, and by empowering human creativity with an intuitive
language interface featuring flexible precision controls: a prompt-based OSC
tool. This study provides a novel perspective on the creative MCP application
at the network protocol level by utilizing LLM's strength in directly

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study links physiological markers like cardiovascular and electrodermal signals to arousal levels, focusing on reproducibility. Two electrodermal features showed statistically significant, reproducible associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of linking subjective emotional experiences with objective physiological markers in Affective Computing, emphasizing reproducibility.

Method: Analyzed 164 cardiovascular and electrodermal features from videos, using the T-Rex method for feature selection with strict false discovery rate control.

Result: Two electrodermal-derived features had statistically significant, reproducible associations with arousal in all cases (100% confirmation rate).

Conclusion: Rigorous reproducibility assessments are crucial in feature selection for Affective Computing, with potential applications in critical areas like mental health and human-robot systems.

Abstract: In Affective Computing, a key challenge lies in reliably linking subjective
emotional experiences with objective physiological markers. This preliminary
study addresses the issue of reproducibility by identifying physiological
features from cardiovascular and electrodermal signals that are associated with
continuous self-reports of arousal levels. Using the Continuously Annotated
Signal of Emotion dataset, we analyzed 164 features extracted from cardiac and
electrodermal signals of 30 participants exposed to short emotion-evoking
videos. Feature selection was performed using the Terminating-Random
Experiments (T-Rex) method, which performs variable selection systematically
controlling a user-defined target False Discovery Rate. Remarkably, among all
candidate features, only two electrodermal-derived features exhibited
reproducible and statistically significant associations with arousal, achieving
a 100\% confirmation rate. These results highlight the necessity of rigorous
reproducibility assessments in physiological features selection, an aspect
often overlooked in Affective Computing. Our approach is particularly promising
for applications in safety-critical environments requiring trustworthy and
reliable white box models, such as mental disorder recognition and human-robot
interaction systems.

*Zhliang Xiang,Meghyn Bienvenu,Gianluca Cima,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Yazmín Ibáñez-García*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces ASPEN+, an extension of ASPEN, for improved entity resolution by supporting local merges and implementing new optimality criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in ASPEN by enabling local merges and offering new criteria for entity resolution, improving accuracy and usability.

Method: Formalized and analyzed optimal solution notions and conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets.

Result: Demonstrated the impact of local merges and optimality criteria on enhancing both accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: Local merges and optimality criteria significantly improve entity resolution performance in terms of both accuracy and runtime.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ASPEN+, which extends an existing ASP-based system,
ASPEN,for collective entity resolution with two important functionalities:
support for local merges and new optimality criteria for preferred solutions.
Indeed, ASPEN only supports so-called global merges of entity-referring
constants (e.g. author ids), in which all occurrences of matched constants are
treated as equivalent and merged accordingly. However, it has been argued that
when resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.
some instances of 'J. Lee' may refer to 'Joy Lee', while others should be
matched with 'Jake Lee'. In addition to allowing such local merges, ASPEN+
offers new optimality criteria for selecting solutions, such as minimizing rule
violations or maximising the number of rules supporting a merge. Our main
contributions are thus (1) the formalisation and computational analysis of
various notions of optimal solution, and (2) an extensive experimental
evaluation on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effect of local merges and
the new optimality criteria on both accuracy and runtime.

### [363] [Efficient Methods for Accurate Sparse Trajectory Recovery and Map Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10460)
*Wei Tian,Jieming Shi,Man Lung Yiu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper addresses two problems related to sparse and misaligned GPS trajectories: trajectory recovery and map matching. Methods TRMMA and MMA are proposed for these tasks, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse GPS trajectories with low sampling rates and misalignment with road networks reduce data quality, impacting applications that require high-quality data. The aim is to improve trajectory inference and alignment accuracy.

Method: The study introduces MMA, a classification method for mapping sparse GPS points to road segments using embeddings of GPS data, directional information, and road segments. It also introduces TRMMA, which employs a dual-transformer for encoding and decoding trajectories and routes, focusing on position ratios and sequential prediction for missing points.

Result: In experiments with 4 large real-world datasets, TRMMA and MMA outperform numerous existing trajectory recovery and map matching methods in terms of result quality and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods TRMMA and MMA significantly advance trajectory recovery and map matching effectiveness, offering efficient and accurate solutions for sparse GPS data issues.

Abstract: Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long
intervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,
yet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To
improve data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study
two related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims
to infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map
matching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying
routes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate
trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the
first step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to
map a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small
candidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop
techniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of
GPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align
sparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the
segments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position
ratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by
avoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a
dual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in
trajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially
predict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct
extensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods
for trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world
datasets. TRMMA and MMA consistently achieve the best result quality, often by
a significant margin.

*Sanghoon Lee,Hyung-Seok Park,Jiyeong Chae,Kyung-Joon Park*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic latency analysis (PLA) model for ROS 2 DDS to analytically predict and optimize communication reliability and latency in lossy wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in tuning ROS 2 DDS communication parameters in wireless networks due to complex interactions among heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission intervals.

Method: Development of a probabilistic latency analysis (PLA) model using discrete state analysis to explore middleware and transport-level events, followed by validation against real-world scenarios.

Result: Validation across 270 scenarios reveals strong alignment between analytical predictions and experimental outcomes, confirming PLA's accuracy and practicality.

Conclusion: The PLA framework provides a theoretical basis to optimize reliability, latency, and performance, improving wireless industrial robotics communication.

Abstract: Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is now the de facto standard for robotic
communication, pairing UDP transport with the Data Distribution Service (DDS)
publish-subscribe middleware. DDS achieves reliability through periodic
heartbeats that solicit acknowledgments for missing samples and trigger
selective retransmissions. In lossy wireless networks, the tight coupling among
heartbeat period, IP fragmentation, and retransmission interval obscures end to
end latency behavior and leaves practitioners with little guidance on how to
tune these parameters. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic
latency analysis (PLA) that analytically models the reliable transmission
process of ROS 2 DDS communication using a discrete state approach. By
systematically analyzing both middleware level and transport level events, PLA
computes the steady state probability distribution of unacknowledged messages
and the retransmission latency. We validate our PLA across 270 scenarios,
exploring variations in packet delivery ratios, message sizes, and both
publishing and retransmission intervals, demonstrating a close alignment
between analytical predictions and experimental results. Our findings establish
a theoretical basis to systematically optimize reliability, latency, and
performance in wireless industrial robotics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable model called COMIND for analyzing neurodegenerative progression using brain connectomes, ensuring monotonic trajectories with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current connectome-based models for neurodegeneration struggle with scalability across many biomarkers due to individual trajectory variability and parameter complexity.

Method: The COMIND model integrates diffusion and logistic concepts with brain structural connectivity, ensuring monotonic disease progression while limiting parameter use.

Result: The model successfully handled simulated data and PPMI data, generalizing to standard brain atlas anatomical imaging without reducing biomarker count.

Conclusion: COMIND represents a scalable and effective tool for studying neurodegenerative dynamics, overcoming limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Mechanistic models of progressive neurodegeneration offer great potential
utility for clinical use and novel treatment development. Toward this end,
several connectome-informed models of neuroimaging biomarkers have been
proposed. However, these models typically do not scale well beyond a small
number of biomarkers due to heterogeneity in individual disease trajectories
and a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce the
Connectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND).
The model combines concepts from diffusion and logistic models with structural
brain connectivity. This guarantees monotonic disease trajectories while
maintaining a limited number of parameters to improve scalability. We evaluate
our model on simulated data as well as on the Parkinson's Progressive Markers
Initiative (PPMI) data. Our model generalizes to anatomical imaging
representations from a standard brain atlas without the need to reduce
biomarker number.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper proposes using neural network ensembles to estimate carbon pools in the North-West European Shelf, complementing sparse observational data and costly reanalyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding carbon dynamics in shelf seas is crucial, but in situ and satellite data are limited or uncertain, necessitating cost-effective alternative methods.

Method: An ensemble of neural networks learns from a coupled physics-biogeochemistry model, trained on a free run simulation, and is applied to reanalysis data.

Result: The neural network ensemble successfully reproduces carbon pool estimates and provides uncertainty information, unlike the current NWES reanalysis.

Conclusion: Model-informed machine learning offers a promising and cost-effective alternative to reanalyses and supplements missing observational data in shelf sea environments.

Abstract: Shelf seas are important for carbon sequestration and carbon cycle, but
available in situ, or satellite data for carbon pools in the shelf sea
environment are often sparse, or highly uncertain. Alternative can be provided
by reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an
ensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled
physics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable
variables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)
sea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is
applied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis
outputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN
ensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We
focus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs
for future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine
learning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could
complement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly
uncertain.

TL;DR: This paper applies a two-neural-network ensemble model to improve jet classification in particle physics, using 2D histograms for data representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jet classification plays a crucial role in understanding fundamental interactions and phenomena beyond the Standard Model, but traditional methods struggle with the complex multidimensional structure of jets.

Method: The paper employs an ensemble of two neural networks to tag jets, transforming jet data into 2D histograms for feature learning.

Result: The Ensemble Model achieves superior performance in both binary and multi-class jet classifications compared to single neural networks.

Conclusion: Using an ensemble of neural networks and representing data as 2D histograms is a promising method for enhanced jet classification in high-energy particle physics.

Abstract: Jet classification in high-energy particle physics is important for
understanding fundamental interactions and probing phenomena beyond the
Standard Model. Jets originate from the fragmentation and hadronization of
quarks and gluons, and pose a challenge for identification due to their
complex, multidimensional structure. Traditional classification methods often
fall short in capturing these intricacies, necessitating advanced machine
learning approaches. In this paper, we employ two neural networks
simultaneously as an ensemble to tag various jet types. We convert the jet data
to two-dimensional histograms instead of representing them as points in a
higher-dimensional space. Specifically, this ensemble approach, hereafter
referred to as Ensemble Model, is used to tag jets into classes from the JetNet
dataset, corresponding to: Top Quarks, Light Quarks (up or down), and W and Z
bosons. For the jet classes mentioned above, we show that the Ensemble Model
can be used for both binary and multi-categorical classification. This ensemble
approach learns jet features by leveraging the strengths of each constituent
network achieving superior performance compared to either individual network.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study investigates using Federated Learning (FL) with Differential Privacy (DP) for cardiovascular risk prediction. It addresses issues like class imbalance and privacy-utility trade-offs by implementing a hybrid data-balancing method and an optimized FedProx algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore Federated Learning (FL) combined with Differential Privacy (DP) for safeguarding patient data, while addressing challenges of privacy-utility trade-offs and class imbalance in decentralized, real-world medical datasets.

Method: The researchers utilized a multi-stage analysis involving FL frameworks for cardiovascular risk prediction. First, they integrated the SMOTETomek technique to address class imbalances. Then, FedProx was optimized for non-IID data to enhance model performance.

Result: The results demonstrated a non-linear trade-off between privacy (epsilon) and model recall. The tuned FedProx algorithm outperformed standard FedAvg, achieving strong privacy guarantees (epsilon 9.0) with a recall above 77%.

Conclusion: The paper provides a methodology for developing effective and secure diagnostic tools using Federated Learning with optimized privacy and utility, applicable to heterogeneous healthcare data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a groundbreaking approach for collaborative
health research, allowing model training on decentralized data while
safeguarding patient privacy. FL offers formal security guarantees when
combined with Differential Privacy (DP). The integration of these technologies,
however, introduces a significant trade-off between privacy and clinical
utility, a challenge further complicated by the severe class imbalance often
present in medical datasets. The research presented herein addresses these
interconnected issues through a systematic, multi-stage analysis. An FL
framework was implemented for cardiovascular risk prediction, where initial
experiments showed that standard methods struggled with imbalanced data,
resulting in a recall of zero. To overcome such a limitation, we first
integrated the hybrid Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Tomek
Links (SMOTETomek) at the client level, successfully developing a clinically
useful model. Subsequently, the framework was optimized for non-IID data using
a tuned FedProx algorithm. Our final results reveal a clear, non-linear
trade-off between the privacy budget (epsilon) and model recall, with the
optimized FedProx consistently out-performing standard FedAvg. An optimal
operational region was identified on the privacy-utility frontier, where strong
privacy guarantees (with epsilon 9.0) can be achieved while maintaining high
clinical utility (recall greater than 77%). Ultimately, our study provides a
practical methodological blueprint for creating effective, secure, and accurate
diagnostic tools that can be applied to real-world, heterogeneous healthcare
data.

*Jinhwa Kim,Ian G. Harris*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Context Filtering model to defend against jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) without compromising their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks on LLMs pose safety and ethical risks by exploiting adversarial contexts to elicit harmful outputs. This creates a need to enhance LLM safety while retaining helpfulness for benign users.

Method: The proposed approach involves an input pre-processing mechanism called Context Filtering, which removes untrustworthy context and identifies primary prompts to detect malicious intent. The method is plug-and-play, operable on both white-box and black-box LLMs without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: The Context Filtering model reduced jailbreak attack success rates by up to 88%, maintaining LLMs' original performance and achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers an effective, publicly available plug-and-play solution for improving LLM safety and usability across various threat scenarios.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advancements in
performance, various jailbreak attacks have posed growing safety and ethical
risks. Malicious users often exploit adversarial context to deceive LLMs,
prompting them to generate responses to harmful queries. In this study, we
propose a new defense mechanism called Context Filtering model, an input
pre-processing method designed to filter out untrustworthy and unreliable
context while identifying the primary prompts containing the real user intent
to uncover concealed malicious intent. Given that enhancing the safety of LLMs
often compromises their helpfulness, potentially affecting the experience of
benign users, our method aims to improve the safety of the LLMs while
preserving their original performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
model in defending against jailbreak attacks through comparative analysis,
comparing our approach with state-of-the-art defense mechanisms against six
different attacks and assessing the helpfulness of LLMs under these defenses.
Our model demonstrates its ability to reduce the Attack Success Rates of
jailbreak attacks by up to 88% while maintaining the original LLMs'
performance, achieving state-of-the-art Safety and Helpfulness Product results.
Notably, our model is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to all LLMs,
including both white-box and black-box models, to enhance their safety without
requiring any fine-tuning of the models themselves. We will make our model
publicly available for research purposes.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CCS-7, a taxonomy of cognitive vulnerabilities in language models, and compares human vs. AI mitigation strategies. Results show that cognitive safety interventions for language models are architecture-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emerging cognitive vulnerabilities in language models that mirror human cognitive biases and challenges, such as emotional framing and decision misalignment.

Method: The researchers proposed a taxonomy of cognitive vulnerabilities (CCS-7), assessed human cognitive security using a randomized controlled trial with a 'Think First, Verify Always' lesson, and tested the effectiveness of these lessons in 12,180 experiments across seven language model architectures.

Result: The study found architecture-specific risk patterns in AI models: some vulnerabilities were mitigated, while others worsened with interventions. Human participants showed consistent moderate cognitive improvement.

Conclusion: Cognitive vulnerability in language models must be addressed as a model-specific engineering challenge, with tailored safety tests necessary for each architecture prior to deployment.

Abstract: Language models exhibit human-like cognitive vulnerabilities, such as
emotional framing, that escape traditional behavioral alignment. We present
CCS-7 (Cognitive Cybersecurity Suite), a taxonomy of seven vulnerabilities
grounded in human cognitive security research. To establish a human benchmark,
we ran a randomized controlled trial with 151 participants: a "Think First,
Verify Always" (TFVA) lesson improved cognitive security by +7.9% overall. We
then evaluated TFVA-style guardrails across 12,180 experiments on seven diverse
language model architectures. Results reveal architecture-dependent risk
patterns: some vulnerabilities (e.g., identity confusion) are almost fully
mitigated, while others (e.g., source interference) exhibit escalating
backfire, with error rates increasing by up to 135% in certain models. Humans,
in contrast, show consistent moderate improvement. These findings reframe
cognitive safety as a model-specific engineering problem: interventions
effective in one architecture may fail, or actively harm, another, underscoring
the need for architecture-aware cognitive safety testing before deployment.

### [371] [Certifiably robust malware detectors by design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10038)
*Pierre-Francois Gimenez,Sarath Sivaprasad,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust malware detection model that remains resistant to adversarial examples, supported by a novel framework called ERDALT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of static malware detectors using machine learning to adversarial examples that can evade detection without altering software behavior.

Method: The authors propose a model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection and introduce the ERDALT framework, which applies a specific structure to enhance empirical robustness against adversarial attacks.

Result: They demonstrate that their approaches achieve robust malware detection while maintaining minimal reduction in detection accuracy, validating the effectiveness of the techniques.

Conclusion: By adapting their proposed structure and framework, malware detection systems can become more resilient to adversarial examples, improving overall security without significant trade-offs.

Abstract: Malware analysis involves analyzing suspicious software to detect malicious
payloads. Static malware analysis, which does not require software execution,
relies increasingly on machine learning techniques to achieve scalability.
Although such techniques obtain very high detection accuracy, they can be
easily evaded with adversarial examples where a few modifications of the sample
can dupe the detector without modifying the behavior of the software. Unlike
other domains, such as computer vision, creating an adversarial example of
malware without altering its functionality requires specific transformations.
We propose a new model architecture for certifiably robust malware detection by
design. In addition, we show that every robust detector can be decomposed into
a specific structure, which can be applied to learn empirically robust malware
detectors, even on fragile features. Our framework ERDALT is based on this
structure. We compare and validate these approaches with machine-learning-based
malware detection methods, allowing for robust detection with limited reduction
of detection performance.

*Wenqiang Wang,Yan Xiao,Hao Lin,Yangshijie Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CEMA, a black-box multi-task text adversarial attack method that requires minimal queries and can target diverse tasks and APIs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task adversarial text attacks struggle in black-box settings with limited queries and practical multi-task scenarios.

Method: CEMA employs a deep-level substitute model in a plug-and-play manner to simplify multi-task attacks and generates adversarial texts through classification models, selecting the most effective one.

Result: CEMA achieved high attack success rates against multi-task models (spanning tasks like summarization, translation, and classification) using as few as 100 queries, and also succeeded in attacking real-world APIs and large models.

Conclusion: CEMA is a highly versatile and effective method for multi-task adversarial text attacks in black-box scenarios, overcoming traditional limitations.

Abstract: Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared
internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As
a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios
involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To
bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{C}luster and \textbf{E}nsemble
\textbf{M}ulti-task Text Adversarial \textbf{A}ttack (\textbf{CEMA}), an
effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial
texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by
using a \textit{deep-level substitute model} trained in a
\textit{plug-and-play} manner for text classification, enabling attacks without
mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for
training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and
allowing attacks across various tasks.
  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text
classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks
substitute models.
  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six
tasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image
generation--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100
queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google
Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation
models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and
effectiveness in real-world applications.

*Jane Carney,Kushal Upreti,Gaby G. Dagher,Tim Andersen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces \Sys, a blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning to combat data poisoning attacks and ensures privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address vulnerabilities in federated learning systems by developing a robust, decentralized poison detection framework.

Method: A blockchain-enabled judge model is proposed, where clients participate in creating a consensus-driven judge model to detect data poisoning.

Result: The developed \Sys framework demonstrates robustness against data poisoning and scalability in the creation of the judge model.

Conclusion: Decentralizing the global server role with a blockchain framework effectively enhances model integrity and scalability in federated learning systems.

Abstract: Federated learning enhances traditional deep learning by enabling the joint
training of a model with the use of IoT device's private data. It ensures
privacy for clients, but is susceptible to data poisoning attacks during
training that degrade model performance and integrity. Current poisoning
detection methods in federated learning lack a standardized detection method or
take significant liberties with trust. In this paper, we present \Sys, a novel
blockchain-enabled poison detection framework in federated learning. The
framework decentralizes the role of the global server across participating
clients. We introduce a judge model used to detect data poisoning in model
updates. The judge model is produced by each client and verified to reach
consensus on a single judge model. We implement our solution to show \Sys is
robust against data poisoning attacks and the creation of our judge model is
scalable.

*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MAESTRO framework to model, detect, and tackle security threats in AI-agents paired with Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the significant security vulnerabilities posed by combining LLMs with autonomous agents in areas like network monitoring and decision-making.

Method: The researchers developed a seven-layer threat modeling framework called MAESTRO. They implemented a prototype system using Python, LangChain, WebSocket telemetry, and various modules for inference, memory, tuning, and anomaly detection.

Result: They identified two major threats—(i) denial-of-service attacks via traffic replay and (ii) memory poisoning through log tampering—that proved to degrade system performance in measurable ways.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the MAESTRO framework is effective for threat assessment and resilient system design and stresses the importance of memory integrity, adaptation monitoring, and cross-layer protection in AI systems.

Abstract: When combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with autonomous agents, used in
network monitoring and decision-making systems, this will create serious
security issues. In this research, the MAESTRO framework consisting of the
seven layers threat modeling architecture in the system was used to expose,
evaluate, and eliminate vulnerabilities of agentic AI. The prototype agent
system was constructed and implemented, using Python, LangChain, and telemetry
in WebSockets, and deployed with inference, memory, parameter tuning, and
anomaly detection modules. Two practical threat cases were confirmed as
follows: (i) resource denial of service by traffic replay denial-of-service,
and (ii) memory poisoning by tampering with the historical log file maintained
by the agent. These situations resulted in measurable levels of performance
degradation, i.e. telemetry updates were delayed, and computational loads were
increased, as a result of poor system adaptations. It was suggested to use a
multilayered defense-in-depth approach with memory isolation, validation of
planners and anomaly response systems in real-time. These findings verify that
MAESTRO is viable in operational threat mapping, prospective risk scoring, and
the basis of the resilient system design. The authors bring attention to the
importance of the enforcement of memory integrity, paying attention to the
adaptation logic monitoring, and cross-layer communication protection that
guarantee the agentic AI reliability in adversarial settings.

*Aydin Zaboli,Junho Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive security framework for Energy Management Systems (EMSs), employing advanced attack detection and a novel Generative AI-based anomaly detection approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the growing cybersecurity threats and systemic vulnerabilities inherent in modern EMSs, compounded by the interconnected nature of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.

Method: A multi-point attack/error model identifies vulnerabilities across EMS pipelines, while a Generative AI-based anomaly detection system and a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework leverage multimodal analysis to tackle these vulnerabilities.

Result: Validation on the IEEE 14-Bus system demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in identifying cyber threats and system inconsistencies through numerical and visual anomaly detection techniques.

Conclusion: By fusing numerical analysis, visual pattern recognition, and linguistic rules, the proposed framework significantly enhances the cybersecurity and resilience of EMSs, offering a novel and practical approach to combating cyber threats and errors.

Abstract: This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically
designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the
dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems
(SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A
comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to
systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data
processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS
database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption
according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges
the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various
phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then,
generative AI (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are
proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios.
Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which
leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules
considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial
reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual
indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and
detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on
the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework's effectiveness across scenarios,
while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach
combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic
rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and scalable network monitoring and security mechanisms that balance resource utilization while maintaining high accuracy in detecting anomalies and coordinated attacks.

Method: NetMoniAI leverages autonomous micro-agents for decentralized local traffic analysis and anomaly detection, paired with a centralized controller for global system insights. Evaluations were conducted using a local testbed and NS-3 simulations.

Result: The two-tier design of NetMoniAI demonstrated scalability under resource constraints, reduced redundancy, and improved response time without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: NetMoniAI is an effective and practical solution for modern network monitoring, and its open-source release supports reproducibility and adaptability across various environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present NetMoniAI, an agentic AI framework for automatic
network monitoring and security that integrates decentralized analysis with
lightweight centralized coordination. The framework consists of two layers:
autonomous micro-agents at each node perform local traffic analysis and anomaly
detection. A central controller then aggregates insights across nodes to detect
coordinated attacks and maintain system-wide situational awareness. We
evaluated NetMoniAI on a local micro-testbed and through NS-3 simulations.
Results confirm that the two-tier agentic-AI design scales under resource
constraints, reduces redundancy, and improves response time without
compromising accuracy. To facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility, the
complete framework is available as open source. This enables researchers and
practitioners to replicate, validate, and extend it across diverse network

### [377] [Searching for Privacy Risks in LLM Agents via Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10880)
*Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper identifies privacy risks posed by malicious agents engaging in multi-turn dialogues and proposes a framework to simulate and optimize attacks and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy threats arising from malicious agents using adaptive dialogue strategies to extract sensitive information.

Method: The paper employs a search-based simulation framework using LLMs as optimizers, simulating interactions with roles (data subject, attacker, defender) and iterative instruction refinement.

Result: Attack strategies evolved from basic requests to complex tactics like impersonation, while defense mechanisms progressed to sophisticated identity verification systems.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates practical utility by transferring discovered strategies across scenarios, aiding in the development of privacy-aware agents.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a
critical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in
multi-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic
dialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy
violations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and
discover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we
present a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and
defender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each
simulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.
While the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)
attempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)
through persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space
efficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel
search with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation
trajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we
find that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to
sophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,
while defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification
state machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse
scenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for
building privacy-aware agents.

*Varsha Sen,Biswash Basnet*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes machine learning models to detect and classify False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in Home Area Networks (HANs), improving smart grid cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDIAs pose significant vulnerabilities to smart grids, especially in Home Area Networks, due to their less stringent security controls. Attackers exploit HANs to disrupt broader grid operations, necessitating robust detection mechanisms.

Method: The paper employs a lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for real-time detection using critical energy consumption features. Additionally, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to classify normal and attack types, using a synthetic time-series dataset to simulate household behavior.

Result: Experimental findings validate that the machine learning models effectively identify and classify FDIAs. This approach is scalable and strengthens grid resilience by providing intelligent real-time detection and classification methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a promising and scalable solution for enhancing smart grid cybersecurity at the residential level, contributing to the broader defense against cyber threats in utility infrastructures.

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose a significant threat to smart grid
infrastructures, particularly Home Area Networks (HANs), where real-time
monitoring and control are highly adopted. Owing to the comparatively less
stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view
them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns,
which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These
attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors
to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms,
thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and
utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based
framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential
energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy
consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack
types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and
sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A
synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household
behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are
effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution
for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward
building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid
cybersecurity from residential endpoints.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Water4MU, a framework using watermarking for machine unlearning, demonstrating improved capability and accuracy in removing specified data influences from ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited exploration of data-level adjustments for machine unlearning and to enhance trust and regulatory compliance.

Method: Integrates digital watermarking with a bi-level optimization framework to precisely modify data and enhance unlearning effectiveness.

Result: Experimental results show Water4MU's success in both image classification and generation tasks, outperforming existing approaches in complex unlearning scenarios.

Conclusion: Water4MU proves as a novel, more efficient method for data removal, maintaining model efficacy and pushing forward capabilities in machine unlearning.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning
(MU) has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing trust and regulatory compliance
by enabling the removal of sensitive data influences from machine learning (ML)
models. However, most MU algorithms primarily rely on in-training methods to
adjust model weights, with limited exploration of the benefits that data-level
adjustments could bring to the unlearning process. To address this gap, we
propose a novel approach that leverages digital watermarking to facilitate MU
by strategically modifying data content. By integrating watermarking, we
establish a controlled unlearning mechanism that enables precise removal of
specified data while maintaining model utility for unrelated tasks. We first
examine the impact of watermarked data on MU, finding that MU effectively
generalizes to watermarked data. Building on this, we introduce an
unlearning-friendly watermarking framework, termed Water4MU, to enhance
unlearning effectiveness. The core of Water4MU is a bi-level optimization (BLO)
framework: at the upper level, the watermarking network is optimized to
minimize unlearning difficulty, while at the lower level, the model itself is
trained independently of watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that
Water4MU is effective in MU across both image classification and image
generation tasks. Notably, it outperforms existing methods in challenging MU
scenarios, known as "challenging forgets".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security teams face challenges like alert fatigue, high false positives, and overwhelming volumes of unstructured CTI documents, hindering effective incident response. The work aims to simplify and enhance IR with advanced AI tools.

Method: The study introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism combining NLP-based searches in CTI vector databases and external CTI platform queries. This contextual data is enriched via an LLM-powered module to generate actionable incident mitigation strategies.

Result: Empirical evaluations on real and simulated alerts show the proposed approach improves IR accuracy, contextual relevance, and efficiency, reducing analyst workload and response time.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of integrating LLMs with CTI for autonomous security operations, offering a promising foundation for intelligent and adaptive cybersecurity frameworks.

Abstract: Effective incident response (IR) is critical for mitigating cyber threats,
yet security teams are overwhelmed by alert fatigue, high false-positive rates,
and the vast volume of unstructured Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) documents.
While CTI holds immense potential for enriching security operations, its
extensive and fragmented nature makes manual analysis time-consuming and
resource-intensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance IR by integrating dynamically
retrieved CTI. Our approach introduces a hybrid retrieval mechanism that
combines NLP-based similarity searches within a CTI vector database with
standardized queries to external CTI platforms, facilitating context-aware
enrichment of security alerts. The augmented intelligence is then leveraged by
an LLM-powered response generation module, which formulates precise,
actionable, and contextually relevant incident mitigation strategies. We
propose a dual evaluation paradigm, wherein automated assessment using an
auxiliary LLM is systematically cross-validated by cybersecurity experts.
Empirical validation on real-world and simulated alerts demonstrates that our
approach enhances the accuracy, contextualization, and efficiency of IR,
alleviating analyst workload and reducing response latency. This work
underscores the potential of LLM-driven CTI fusion in advancing autonomous
security operations and establishing a foundation for intelligent, adaptive
cybersecurity frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With ASR models being widely used, studying their vulnerability to adversarial attacks is critical for ensuring security and reliability.

Method: The authors evaluate adversarial attacks, relax the optimization objective for reduced perceptibility, and explore a low-pass filter defense against these attacks.

Result: The study reveals that relaxing the optimization objective can improve attack imperceptibility, while a low-pass filter can serve as a potential defense mechanism.

Conclusion: The research highlights both novel strategies to enhance adversarial attacks' imperceptibility and a feasible defense mechanism, contributing to the development of robust ASR systems.

Abstract: Currently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are deployed in an
extensive range of applications. However, recent studies have demonstrated the
possibility of adversarial attack on these models which could potentially
suppress or disrupt model output. We investigate and verify the robustness of
these attacks and explore if it is possible to increase their imperceptibility.
We additionally find that by relaxing the optimisation objective from complete
suppression to partial suppression, we can further decrease the
imperceptibility of the attack. We also explore possible defences against these
attacks and show a low-pass filter defence could potentially serve as an
effective defence.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of 11 deep learning models in extracting bioacoustic features. It emphasizes the need for fine-tuning and identifies performance issues across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess how well audio-pretrained deep learning models extract bioacoustic features for ecological monitoring tasks.

Method: 11 deep learning models are benchmarked by reducing the dimensionality of their embeddings and evaluating them through clustering tasks.

Result: The study finds that non-fine-tuned models underperform, and even fine-tuned models fail to separate background from labeled sounds, with exceptions like ResNet in specific cases.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning audio-pretrained models is crucial, and their embeddings should be thoroughly evaluated to ensure reliable bioacoustic analyses.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of animal sounds, offers a non-invasive method to
monitor ecosystems. Extracting embeddings from audio-pretrained deep learning
(DL) models without fine-tuning has become popular for obtaining bioacoustic
features for tasks. However, a recent benchmark study reveals that while
fine-tuned audio-pretrained VGG and transformer models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in some tasks, they fail in others. This study benchmarks 11 DL
models on the same tasks by reducing their learned embeddings' dimensionality
and evaluating them through clustering. We found that audio-pretrained DL
models 1) without fine-tuning even underperform fine-tuned AlexNet, 2) both
with and without fine-tuning fail to separate the background from labeled
sounds, but ResNet does, and 3) outperform other models when fewer background
sounds are included during fine-tuning. This study underscores the necessity of
fine-tuning audio-pretrained models and checking the embeddings after
fine-tuning. Our codes are available:

TL;DR: This paper introduces PuttNet, a post-processing neural network designed to reduce audio artifacts caused by speech enhancement models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the quality of speech enhancement systems by addressing artifacts introduced during noise removal.

Method: The proposed method alternates between a speech enhancement model and PuttNet to refine audio quality. Performance is evaluated using perceptual and intelligibility metrics.

Result: The proposed approach achieves better scores in PESQ, STOI, and CBAK, signifying improved quality and reduced background noise intrusiveness.

Conclusion: Alternating between a speech enhancement model and PuttNet leads to better performance compared to repeatedly applying either model individually.

Abstract: Speech enhancement using artificial neural networks aims to remove noise from
noisy speech signals while preserving the speech content. However, speech
enhancement networks often introduce distortions to the speech signal, referred
to as artifacts, which can degrade audio quality. In this work, we propose a
post-processing neural network designed to mitigate artifacts introduced by
speech enhancement models. Inspired by the analogy of making a `Putt' after an
`Approach' in golf, we name our model PuttNet. We demonstrate that alternating
between a speech enhancement model and the proposed Putt model leads to
improved speech quality, as measured by perceptual quality scores (PESQ),
objective intelligibility (STOI), and background noise intrusiveness (CBAK)
scores. Furthermore, we illustrate with graphical analysis why this alternating
Approach outperforms repeated application of either model alone.

Motivation: Deepfake audio is proliferating on social media due to advancements in speech generation technology, making robust detection critical for security and authenticity.

Method: The authors created the Fake Speech Wild dataset and used self-supervised learning and public datasets to benchmark countermeasures. They also explored data augmentation techniques for robustness.

Result: Augmenting public datasets with the Fake Speech Wild set drastically lowered the equal error rate (EER) to 3.54%, improving real-world deepfake detection significantly.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse real and deepfake data improves the performance of countermeasures, making them more effective in real-world scenarios like social media.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technology has led to the
widespread proliferation of deepfake speech across social media platforms.
While deepfake audio countermeasures (CMs) achieve promising results on public
datasets, their performance degrades significantly in cross-domain scenarios.
To advance CMs for real-world deepfake detection, we first propose the Fake
Speech Wild (FSW) dataset, which includes 254 hours of real and deepfake audio
from four different media platforms, focusing on social media. As CMs, we
establish a benchmark using public datasets and advanced selfsupervised
learning (SSL)-based CMs to evaluate current CMs in real-world scenarios. We
also assess the effectiveness of data augmentation strategies in enhancing CM
robustness for detecting deepfake speech on social media. Finally, by
augmenting public datasets and incorporating the FSW training set, we
significantly advanced real-world deepfake audio detection performance,
achieving an average equal error rate (EER) of 3.54% across all evaluation

intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the

Result: Reduced parameter requirements enabled fitting complex functions, training on a noisy quantum simulator, and real data inference on quantum hardware.

Conclusion: Constraining frequencies and dimensions can expand the practical applications of QML, making current quantum hardware more capable for specific tasks.

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

*Xuexin Xu,Siyu Wang,Radhika Joshi,Rihan Hai,Mohammad H. Ansari*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel three-qubit entangling gate that performs specified operations in a single step, showing superior robustness and performance across various quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency and complexity of conventional multi-two-qubit gate decompositions by introducing a native three-qubit entangling gate.

Method: A hybrid optimization approach to engineer desired interactions, suppress unwanted couplings, and employ a cross-resonance gate framework for robust quantum operations.

Result: The gate succeeded in applications like GHZ state preparation, Toffoli-class logic demonstration, and controlled-ZZ gates, showing robustness even under increased excitation numbers.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential for native multiqubit gate designs, laying a foundation for advanced quantum processor architectures and error correction protocols.

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

*Alokesh Manna,Sujit K. Ghosh*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper presents a Bayesian framework for handling variable selection in linear regression with autocorrelated errors, specifically in time series contexts, showcasing improved predictive performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series analysis often requires capturing temporal dependencies, including lagged covariates and autocorrelated errors, which current variable selection methods struggle to address efficiently.

Method: The authors use hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors and a two-stage MCMC algorithm to handle high-dimensional challenges in variable selection and autocorrelation modeling.

Result: Simulations and real applications demonstrate superior variable selection accuracy and predictive performance, with lower MSPE and improved robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The developed framework is practically effective for handling autoregressive settings, enhancing both model interpretation and forecasting accuracy in diverse applications.

Abstract: We develop a Bayesian framework for variable selection in linear regression
with autocorrelated errors, accommodating lagged covariates and autoregressive
structures. This setting occurs in time series applications where responses
depend on contemporaneous or past explanatory variables and persistent
stochastic shocks, including financial modeling, hydrological forecasting, and
meteorological applications requiring temporal dependency capture. Our
methodology uses hierarchical Bayesian models with spike-and-slab priors to
simultaneously select relevant covariates and lagged error terms. We propose an
efficient two-stage MCMC algorithm separating sampling of variable inclusion
indicators and model parameters to address high-dimensional computational
challenges. Theoretical analysis establishes posterior selection consistency
under mild conditions, even when candidate predictors grow exponentially with
sample size, common in modern time series with many potential lagged variables.
Through simulations and real applications (groundwater depth prediction, S&P
500 log returns modeling), we demonstrate substantial gains in variable
selection accuracy and predictive performance. Compared to existing methods,
our framework achieves lower MSPE, improved true model component
identification, and greater robustness with autocorrelated noise, underscoring
practical utility for model interpretation and forecasting in autoregressive
settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CATNet, a graph-based pricing model for CAT bonds using Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN), outperforming traditional methods and a Random Forest benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models fail to effectively capture the complex relational data in CAT bonds, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The paper uses CATNet, employing R-GCN to represent the CAT bond market as a graph and incorporating topological centrality measures for spread prediction.

Result: CATNet delivers high predictive performance, surpasses benchmarks, and provides insights into industry-related features like issuer reputation and underwriter influence.

Conclusion: CATNet establishes a new paradigm for risk assessment, demonstrating that graph-based models can achieve superior accuracy and deliver quantifiable market insights.

Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture
the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper
introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning
architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the
CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure
for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits
the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few
highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive
performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The
inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further,
significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these
network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative
proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation,
underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence
that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new
paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver
both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how self-supervised learning (SSL) models capture speaker traits (age, gender) in children's speech, highlighting the layer-wise encoding across different Wav2Vec2 variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding about how SSL models process speaker characteristics in children's speech, which is highly variable compared to adult speech.

Method: Performed a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 SSL models using PCA on PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets, focusing on speaker-specific cues and classification performance.

Result: Early model layers (1-7) better capture speaker-specific traits, with PCA enhancing classification. Best results: 97.14% age and 98.20% gender accuracy on CMU Kids dataset, and 86.05% age, 95.00% gender on PFSTAR dataset.

Conclusion: Speaker traits in children are encoded differently across SSL model layers, with early layers being more effective for classification tasks. Findings suggest benefits in targeted approaches for child-specific speech applications.

Abstract: Children's speech presents challenges for age and gender classification due
to high variability in pitch, articulation, and developmental traits. While
self-supervised learning (SSL) models perform well on adult speech tasks, their
ability to encode speaker traits in children remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed layer-wise analysis of four Wav2Vec2 variants using the
PFSTAR and CMU Kids datasets. Results show that early layers (1-7) capture
speaker-specific cues more effectively than deeper layers, which increasingly
focus on linguistic information. Applying PCA further improves classification,
reducing redundancy and highlighting the most informative components. The
Wav2Vec2-large-lv60 model achieves 97.14% (age) and 98.20% (gender) on CMU
Kids; base-100h and large-lv60 models reach 86.05% and 95.00% on PFSTAR. These
results reveal how speaker traits are structured across SSL model depth and
support more targeted, adaptive strategies for child-aware speech interfaces.

*Pierre Humbert,Ulysse Gazin,Ruth Heller,Etienne Roquain*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces OnlineSCI, an adaptive extension to ACI for quantifying uncertainty in online settings, enabling selective inference tasks and providing robust theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods such as ACI quantify uncertainty in supervised online settings but lack capabilities for targeted time-point selection and adaptive updates of the prediction algorithm.

Method: The paper proposes OnlineSCI, an extended algorithm of ACI, which allows selective inference while ensuring both long-term average missed coverage control and instantaneous error rate regulation at selected times.

Result: The theoretical results demonstrate that OnlineSCI achieves convergence to optimal solutions with quantifiable rates under specific conditions and handles adversarial environments effectively.

Conclusion: OnlineSCI enhances the utility of quantifying uncertainty through adaptive selective inference mechanisms, validated by theoretical consistency and empirical experiments.

Abstract: In a supervised online setting, quantifying uncertainty has been proposed in
the seminal work of \cite{gibbs2021adaptive}. For any given point-prediction
algorithm, their method (ACI) produces a conformal prediction set with an
average missed coverage getting close to a pre-specified level $\alpha$ for a
long time horizon. We introduce an extended version of this algorithm, called
OnlineSCI, allowing the user to additionally select times where such an
inference should be made. OnlineSCI encompasses several prominent online
selective tasks, such as building prediction intervals for extreme outcomes,
classification with abstention, and online testing. While OnlineSCI controls
the average missed coverage on the selected in an adversarial setting, our
theoretical results also show that it controls the instantaneous error rate
(IER) at the selected times, up to a non-asymptotical remainder term.
Importantly, our theory covers the case where OnlineSCI updates the
point-prediction algorithm at each time step, a property which we refer to as
{\it adaptive} capability. We show that the adaptive versions of OnlineSCI can
convergence to an optimal solution and provide an explicit convergence rate in
each of the aforementioned application cases, under specific mild conditions.
Finally, the favorable behavior of OnlineSCI in practice is illustrated by
numerical experiments.

TL;DR: FROGENT is a unified framework for drug discovery that integrates AI models, databases, and tools, addressing current fragmentation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fragmentation and inefficiency in current AI tools for drug discovery that require managing incompatible systems and scripts.

Method: FROGENT employs a Large Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to combine biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models for performing drug discovery tasks.

Result: FROGENT outperformed six ReAct-style agents as well as other models, tripling hit-finding performance and doubling interaction profiling capabilities, validated with benchmarks and real-world cases.

Conclusion: Streamlining drug discovery through agentic frameworks like FROGENT significantly enhances productivity and is a promising approach for future research.

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,
named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large
Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

### [394] [Accelerating exoplanet climate modelling: A machine learning approach to complement 3D GCM grid simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10827)
*Alexander Plaschzug,Amit Reza,Ludmila Carone,Sebastian Gernjak,Christiane Helling*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the potential of using machine learning (ML) models to predict the 3D temperature and wind structures of tidally-locked exoplanets, demonstrating that dense neural networks (DNN) and decision tree algorithms (XGBoost) can efficiently emulate general circulation models (GCMs) for such planetary atmospheres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of advanced telescopes collecting highly detailed exoplanetary atmospheric data necessitates enhanced 3D climate models. The computational demands of traditional general circulation models (GCMs) make it difficult to simulate diverse exoplanetary conditions, creating a need for more efficient predictive methods.

Method: A 3D GCM grid of 60 tidally-locked hot Jupiters was simulated using ExoRad, accounting for various host star types. Dense Neural Networks (DNN) and the XGBoost decision tree algorithm were trained on these results to predict gas temperatures and wind structures. The models were validated using specific planets targeted by PLATO for observation.

Result: The DNN demonstrated highly accurate predictions of gas temperatures, achieving close agreement (within 32 ppm difference in spectra) for most test cases except one peculiar observation. The ML models successfully predicted the 3D thermal profiles of tidally-locked hot Jupiters across different star classes.

Conclusion: The proposed ML-based models are efficient alternatives to traditional GCMs in simulating 3D atmospheric dynamics of gaseous exoplanets, providing reliable spectra for analysis with minimal errors, and can significantly accelerate ensemble studies for such planets.

Abstract: With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.

TL;DR: The paper presents SCMS-PINN v35, a neural network model to predict electronic band structures in graphene accurately, rigorously enforcing symmetry constraints for high computational efficiency and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting electronic band structures, especially in 2D materials like graphene, is challenging due to the need for a balance between computational efficiency and physical accuracy.

Method: The authors developed SCMS-PINN v35, which employs a multi-head ResNet-6 architecture with specialized pathways for learning Dirac physics, saddle points, and interpolation. The approach enforces crystallographic symmetries and uses progressive Dirac constraint scheduling on physics-informed features extracted from k-points.

Result: The model reduced training loss from 34.597 to 0.003 with validation loss of 0.0085, achieved Dirac point gaps within 30.3 μeV of theoretical zero, and had low average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction). All symmetries (C6v) were preserved via averaging.

Conclusion: The SCMS-PINN framework demonstrates accurate symmetry-constrained predictions for 2D materials and provides a foundation for broader exploration and discovery of such materials.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic band structures in two-dimensional
materials remains a fundamental challenge, with existing methods struggling to
balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy. We present the
Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN)
v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing
crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach
introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics,
M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation --
operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive
Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from
5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local
critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\%
reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085.
The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\mu$eV of theoretical zero and
achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across
the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through
systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework
establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader
two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an explainable fact-checking framework that integrates content, social media, and graph-based features, offering interpretable insights and improved multimodal misinformation classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the global spread of misinformation amplified through social media and to overcome limitations of existing fact-checking systems that focus solely on content analysis or labeling information as false.

Method: The framework combines a misinformation classifier and explainability techniques utilizing multimodal (content, social media, and graph-based) features. It employs experiments and a novel protocol to assess explanations for interpretability, trustworthiness, and robustness.

Result: Experiments show that multimodal information enhances classification performance across datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. The framework successfully generates human-understandable justifications for predictions.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches combining content and social media dynamics are effective for misinformation detection, and adding explainability improves user trust and the overall robustness of predictions.

Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content
trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems.
Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes"
and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond
content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling
content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation
and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that
combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance
fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability
techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting
classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information
improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on
datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's
explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and
robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates
human-understandable justifications for its predictions.

TL;DR: The study introduces a hybrid deep learning model (SABIA) to analyze opioid-related behaviors on social media via Reddit, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding opioid misuse on social media due to informal and coded language.

Method: Development of the SABIA model, a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid, with data preprocessing, representation, fine-tuning, and classification into five behavior categories using a newly constructed dataset.

Result: SABIA outperformed previous models, achieving a 9.30% improvement in accuracy over the baseline and robustness compared to seven prior studies.

Conclusion: Hybrid deep learning models like SABIA can effectively capture complex opioid-related behaviors on social media, aiding public health interventions.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public
health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use,
and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to
the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can
obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of
opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions,
slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and
developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create
a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target
dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing
semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data
preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning
phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new
dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors
across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users,
Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines.
Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA
achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic
Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven
previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study
demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex
opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring
and intervention efforts.

Result: It offers an accessible introduction for practitioners and highlights areas for future research and algorithm development in machine learning.

Conclusion: Bayesian optimization holds promise in experimental sciences, but addressing accessibility and algorithmic challenges can expand its utility in bioprocess engineering.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization has become widely popular across various experimental
sciences due to its favorable attributes: it can handle noisy data, perform
well with relatively small datasets, and provide adaptive suggestions for
sequential experimentation. While still in its infancy, Bayesian optimization
has recently gained traction in bioprocess engineering. However,
experimentation with biological systems is highly complex and the resulting
experimental uncertainty requires specific extensions to classical Bayesian
optimization. Moreover, current literature often targets readers with a strong
statistical background, limiting its accessibility for practitioners.
  In light of these developments, this review has two aims: first, to provide
an intuitive and practical introduction to Bayesian optimization; and second,
to outline promising application areas and open algorithmic challenges, thereby

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The intent is to create a user-friendly, practical tool that addresses statistical modeling for spatially varying data without the computational burden of methods like MCMC.

Method: BKP utilizes a combination of kernel-weighted likelihoods and conjugate beta priors. It avoids latent variable augmentation and adopts closed-form posterior inference, making it computationally efficient.

priors, resulting in closed-form posterior inference without requiring latent
variable augmentation or intensive MCMC sampling. The package supports binary
and aggregated binomial responses, allows flexible choices of kernel functions
and prior specification, and provides loss-based kernel hyperparameter tuning
procedures. In addition, BKP extends naturally to the Dirichlet Kernel Process
(DKP) for modeling spatially varying multinomial or compositional data. To our
knowledge, this is the first publicly available R package for implementing
BKP-based methods. We illustrate the use of BKP through several synthetic and
real-world datasets, highlighting its interpretability, accuracy, and
scalability. The package aims to facilitate practical application and future
methodological development of kernel-based beta modeling in statistics and
machine learning.

### [400] [Estimating Covariance for Global Minimum Variance Portfolio: A Decision-Focused Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10776)
*Juchan Kim,Inwoo Tae,Yongjae Lee*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper studies decision-focused learning (DFL) as a method to optimize portfolio construction, claiming it outperforms traditional mean-squared error-based approaches in portfolio allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional parameter estimation methods, such as minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), which may result in suboptimal investment decisions.

Method: The paper uses decision-focused learning (DFL) to directly optimize decision quality. It derives the global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP) using theoretical gradients of a decision loss and examines key properties and mechanisms of DFL.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DFL-based methods outperform MSE-based approaches in practical portfolio allocation, leading to superior decision-making and volatility reduction.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DFL-based approaches are more effective for portfolio optimization than traditional methods, offering better decision quality and risk reduction capabilities.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization constitutes a cornerstone of risk management by
quantifying the risk-return trade-off. Since it inherently depends on accurate
parameter estimation under conditions of future uncertainty, the selection of
appropriate input parameters is critical for effective portfolio construction.
However, most conventional statistical estimators and machine learning
algorithms determine these parameters by minimizing mean-squared error (MSE), a
criterion that can yield suboptimal investment decisions. In this paper, we
adopt decision-focused learning (DFL) - an approach that directly optimizes
decision quality rather than prediction error such as MSE - to derive the
global minimum-variance portfolio (GMVP). Specifically, we theoretically derive
the gradient of decision loss using the analytic solution of GMVP and its
properties regarding the principal components of itself. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we show that prediction-focused estimation methods may
fail to produce optimal allocations in practice, whereas DFL-based methods
consistently deliver superior decision performance. Furthermore, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of DFL's mechanism in GMVP construction, focusing on its
volatility reduction capability, decision-driving features, and estimation
characteristics.

### [401] [DINOMotion: advanced robust tissue motion tracking with DINOv2 in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10260)
*Soorena Salari,Catherine Spino,Laurie-Anne Pharand,Fabienne Lathuiliere,Hassan Rivaz,Silvain Beriault,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DINOMotion, a deep learning-based framework for tissue motion tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy, achieving high accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability while addressing challenges like large misalignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tissue motion tracking methods in MRI-guided radiotherapy struggle with large misalignments and lack interpretability, motivating the need for a robust, efficient, and interpretable solution.

Method: A novel framework, DINOMotion, combines DINOv2 with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for efficient and robust registration of sequential images. It uses landmark detection for interpretable motion tracking.

Result: Experiments achieved Dice scores of 92.07% (kidney), 90.90% (liver), and 95.23% (lung), with corresponding Hausdorff distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods, processes scans in ~30ms, and excels in addressing large misalignments.

Conclusion: DINOMotion offers a robust, interpretable, and efficient solution for real-time tissue motion tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, demonstrating significant improvements over current methods.

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

*Nishan Rai,Sujan Khatri,Devendra Risal*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning framework utilizing chest CT images for automated lung cancer screening with integrated explainability, achieving high accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality globally, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. However, manual screening can be both time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Method: The paper evaluates a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning models (DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19). The framework also incorporates cost-sensitive learning to address class imbalance and uses SHAP for explainability to enhance clinical transparency.

Result: ResNet152 showed the highest accuracy at 97.3%, while DenseNet121 achieved the best balance in performance metrics including precision (92%), recall (90%), and F1-score (91%). SHAP improved visualization of model predictions, enhancing transparency.

Conclusion: Integrating explainability and high-performance CNN models can provide effective, interpretable, and fast support for lung cancer screening, especially in settings with limited resources.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We
present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from
chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We
further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence
contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate
that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast,
accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in
resource-limited settings.

*Sahar Nasirihaghighi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in surgical video analysis by developing data-efficient, scalable AI systems, introducing novel frameworks, and releasing multi-task datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between research-based surgical video analysis and its practical use in clinical environments, while mitigating challenges such as annotation scarcity, spatiotemporal complexity, and domain gaps.

Method: Benchmarking neural network architectures, proposing new architectures, and developing semi-supervised frameworks like DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE to reduce reliance on labeled data by leveraging dynamic pseudo-labeling.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on surgical video tasks using minimal labeled data and introduced large datasets (GynSurg, Cataract-1K) to support further research.

Conclusion: The research advances efficient and scalable AI solutions for surgical video analysis, with significant implications for improving surgical care and training.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical
care and training.

*Zhaoming Kong,Jiahuan Zhang,Xiaowei Yang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Haar-tSVD, a computationally efficient and effective image denoising algorithm leveraging PCA and the Haar transform through tensor-SVD projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for efficient image denoising methods capable of handling the high volume of image data generated daily.

Method: The Haar-tSVD algorithm explores nonlocal self-similarity and employs tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) combined with the Haar transform for image denoising. It includes an adaptive noise estimation scheme using a CNN and eigenvalue analysis.

Result: Experiments on various real-world tasks demonstrate Haar-tSVD's capability for efficient noise removal and detail preservation.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD provides a single-step, parallelizable solution for image denoising, balancing speed and performance effectively, with publicly available datasets and code.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

*Xinyi Wang,Angeliki Katsenou,David Bull*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment (VQA) model named DIVA-VQA, achieving top-tier performance on five datasets with low runtime complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the growing need for effective large-scale video quality assessment in social media and streaming platforms, where reference video content is unavailable.

Method: The proposed model uses spatio-temporal fragmentation based on inter-frame variations to analyze video quality-sensitive regions across multiple scales using both 2D and 3D features.

Result: The model ranked among the top 2 performers on average rank correlation across five UGC datasets and demonstrated low runtime complexity, offering competitive performance.

Conclusion: DIVA-VQA is a promising NR-VQA model for applications requiring accurate video quality assessment under resource constraints. Its code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are
publicly available at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/DIVA-VQA.
