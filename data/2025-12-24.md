### [1] [PhysMaster: Building an Autonomous AI Physicist for Theoretical and Computational Physics Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19799)
*Tingjia Miao,Jiawen Dai,Jingkun Liu,Jinxin Tan,Muhua Zhang,Wenkai Jin,Yuwen Du,Tian Jin,Xianghe Pang,Zexi Liu,Tu Guo,Zhengliang Zhang,Yunjie Huang,Shuo Chen,Rui Ye,Yuzhi Zhang,Linfeng Zhang,Kun Chen,Wei Wang,Weinan E,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent designed to function as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist, addressing challenges in applying LLMs to physics research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs can advance physics research, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and involves integrating analytical reasoning with computation, by addressing limitations of existing AI evaluations on open-ended scientific tasks.

Method: PhysMaster combines abstract reasoning, numerical computation, and employs LANDAU, a data system preserving literature and prior knowledge, with an adaptive exploration strategy for tackling open problems in physics efficiently.

Result: Through evaluation on diverse physics problems, PhysMaster demonstrated capabilities in accelerating research, automating hypothesis-driven tasks, and independently discovering solutions in areas like high-energy theory and astrophysics.

Conclusion: PhysMaster showcases significant potential to enhance and automate physics research, indicating a broader application of LLMs in complex, open-ended scientific inquiries.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

### [2] [A Branch-and-Price Algorithm for Fast and Equitable Last-Mile Relief Aid Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19882)
*Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,F. Sibel Salman,Walter J. Gutjahr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses vehicle routing and relief supply allocation in post-disaster scenarios with a focus on equity and efficiency, proposing a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm that outperforms standard solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a method of distributing relief supplies to shelters post-disaster that is both fair (reducing inequity in aid distribution) and efficient (minimizing delivery time).

Method: A bi-objective problem is formulated using a Gini-index-based measure for inequity and total travel time. A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model is proposed with valid inequalities for optimization. The $ε$-constraint method and a branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm are used to solve the problem efficiently.

Result: The proposed B&P algorithm outperforms commercial MIP solvers in computational tests, achieving a 34% reduction in aid distribution inequity without compromising efficiency under different time constraints.

Conclusion: The bi-objective approach achieves a balance between equity and efficiency. Lexicographic optimization works well under extreme time constraints, while a balanced approach is better when time constraints are moderate to ensure fair distribution.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

### [3] [Interpolative Decoding: Exploring the Spectrum of Personality Traits in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19937)
*Eric Yeh,John Cadigan,Ran Chen,Dick Crouch,Melinda Gervasio,Dayne Freitag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to mimic human behaviors, especially in decision-making tasks, and proposes an approach called interpolative decoding to make personality-based simulations more replicable and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers are interested in using LLMs as proxies for humans to study human behaviors and decision-making, specifically focusing on personality effects. However, traditional methods of representing personalities are inefficient and reduce experimental replicability.

Method: The paper introduces interpolative decoding, which represents personality dimensions (e.g., Big Five traits) as opposed prompt pairs and uses an interpolation parameter to simulate human-like behavior in various tasks.

Result: Interpolative decoding successfully modulates LLMs' personality dimension scores and mimics human decision-making behaviors in economic games, aligning with psychological research. It also shows initial success in matching individual human behaviors in collaborative games.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances efficiency and replicability in using LLMs to simulate human-like behaviors, making them useful tools for psychological and economic studies.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

### [4] [Zero-Shot Segmentation through Prototype-Guidance for Multi-Label Plant Species Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19957)
*Luciano Araujo Dourado Filho,Almir Moreira da Silva Neto,Rodrigo Pereira David,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using Vision Transformers (ViT) and class prototypes for species identification in high-resolution vegetation images, adapting from multi-class to multi-label classification. Achieved fifth place in PlantCLEF 2025 with an F1 score of 0.33331.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve species identification methods as part of the PlantClef challenge, addressing challenges in fine-grained multi-label classification using high-resolution images.

Method: The method uses K-Means clustering to generate class prototypes from training data, extracts features using a pre-trained DinoV2 model, and trains a customized narrow Vision Transformer for segmentation to guide species classification.

Result: The approach achieved fifth place in the PlantClef 2025 challenge, with an F1 score of 0.33331 and a competitive performance, just 0.03 lower than the top-performing method.

Conclusion: The solution demonstrates competitive performance and provides an effective domain adaptation approach for multi-label species identification using Vision Transformers. The code is openly available.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

### [5] [FGDCC: Fine-Grained Deep Cluster Categorization -- A Framework for Intra-Class Variability Problems in Plant Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19960)
*Luciano Araujo Dourado Filho,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method that improves classification in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) tasks by reducing intra-class variability through class-wise clustering and pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of intra-class variability in FGVC tasks, which hinders deep learning models, especially for underrepresented classes.

Method: The method applies clustering within each class to generate pseudo-labels representing latent image similarity, using these labels in hierarchical classification to extract fine-grained features.

Result: Initial experiments on the PlantNet300k dataset highlight critical areas for improvement but achieve state-of-the-art performance, despite some components not being fully optimized.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows potential in mitigating intra-class variability in FGVC tasks, with promising results and room for future optimization.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

### [6] [S$^3$IT: A Benchmark for Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19992)
*Zhe Sun,Xueyuan Yang,Yujie Lu,Zhenliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark to evaluate embodied social intelligence in agents, combining physical and social constraints within a realistic, spatially situated context. Current state-of-the-art LLMs perform below humans in this test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in evaluating embodied agents, as existing evaluations either focus solely on text-based social reasoning or ignore social constraints in physical tasks.

Method: The authors developed S$^{3}$IT, a benchmark test involving a 3D environment where agents must arrange seating based on NPC preferences, dialogues, environmental exploration, and optimization under complex constraints.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs were tested and demonstrated significant gaps compared to human performance, revealing weaknesses in spatial intelligence and strengths in resolving conflicts with explicit textual cues.

Conclusion: LLMs show deficiencies in integrating spatial and social reasoning, suggesting a need for further advancements in embodied social intelligence for agents.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

### [7] [Discovering Lie Groups with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20043)
*Jung Yeon Park,Yuxuan Chen,Floor Eijkelboom,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Lawson L. S. Wong,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for discovering symmetries in data called \lieflow using flow matching on Lie groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding physical systems and enhancing machine learning performance necessitates knowledge of symmetries within data.

Method: The authors design \lieflow, a method that formulates symmetry discovery as learning distributions over hypothesis groups using flow matching on Lie groups.

Result: The method successfully discovers discrete groups, such as reflections, through experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds.

Conclusion: \lieflow offers a flexible approach for symmetry discovery and addresses challenges like symmetric arrangement and late convergence in flow matching.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

### [8] [Learning Skills from Action-Free Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20052)
*Hung-Chieh Fang,Kuo-Han Hung,Chu-Rong Chen,Po-Jung Chou,Chun-Kai Yang,Po-Chen Ko,Yu-Chiang Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu,Min-Hung Chen,Shao-Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SOF, a framework utilizing optical flow to abstract skills from action-free videos for improved planning and translation into robot actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models for robotics struggle to translate visuals into actionable strategies, while latent-action models lack high-level planning capabilities. The paper addresses these limitations.

Method: SOF learns latent skills using optical flow as an intermediate representation to capture motion dynamics aligned with both video and robot actions, enabling skill derivation from raw visual data.

Result: SOF showed improved performance in multitask and long-horizon scenarios, effectively acquiring and composing skills from videos.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between video-derived visual insights and actionable robot strategies, enhancing planning and execution capabilities.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

### [9] [Towards Generative Location Awareness for Disaster Response: A Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20056)
*Hao Li,Fabian Deuser,Wenping Yin,Steffen Knoblauch,Wufan Zhao,Filip Biljecki,Yong Xue,Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new geolocalization approach, ProbGLC, to enhance disaster response by improving accuracy and explainability through probabilistic and deterministic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change, rapid identification of disaster locations is essential for effective response and resource allocation, but traditional geolocalization methods face challenges in accuracy and speed.

Method: The paper proposes the ProbGLC method, which integrates probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models. This approach improves explainability with uncertainty quantification and enhances performance, designed specifically for rapid disaster response through features like probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Result: The proposed method was evaluated on two disaster datasets (MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), demonstrating superior geolocalization accuracy (0.86 Acc@1km, 0.97 Acc@25km) and enhanced explainability through probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Conclusion: ProbGLC provides a significant advancement for disaster management, offering state-of-the-art accuracy and explainability in geolocalization, thereby facilitating faster and more effective disaster responses. The data and source code are publicly accessible.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response. The data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/bobleegogogo/ProbGLC

### [10] [Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Content Moderation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20061)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges and demonstrates the effectiveness of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for policy-driven content moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of content moderation at scale, particularly in terms of label sparsity, evolving policies, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond pattern matching.

Method: The authors investigate RL-based methods by systematically evaluating RL training strategies and reward-shaping techniques, transforming general-purpose language models into specialized policy-aligned classifiers for content moderation tasks.

Result: The results show RL's sigmoid-like scaling behavior, improving performance smoothly and achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning for tasks requiring complex reasoning.

Conclusion: RL is highly effective for content moderation in domains with limited expert annotations or costly labeling, offering actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems while demonstrating superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

### [11] [Reason2Decide: Rationale-Driven Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20074)
*H M Quamran Hasan,Housam Khalifa Bashier,Jiayi Dai,Mi-Young Kim,Randy Goebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reason2Decide is a two-stage training framework enhancing predictive accuracy and rationale alignment in clinical decision systems. It outperforms baselines in accuracy and rationale fidelity, even with smaller model sizes and LLM-generated rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision support systems need high predictive accuracy along with explanations that align appropriately with predictions, which current models struggle to achieve due to exposure bias.

Method: Reason2Decide involves two training stages: Stage-1 focuses on rationale generation, and Stage-2 jointly trains label prediction and rationale generation using scheduled sampling to mitigate exposure bias.

Result: The framework outperformed fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in predictive accuracy and rationale fidelity across multiple datasets, demonstrating robustness in various rationale sources and enabling smaller, resource-friendly model deployments.

Conclusion: Reason2Decide provides an effective solution for explainable and resource-efficient clinical decision systems, leveraging LLM-generated rationales while reducing dependency on human annotations.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

### [12] [Adaptive Financial Sentiment Analysis for NIFTY 50 via Instruction-Tuned LLMs , RAG and Reinforcement Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20082)
*Chaithra,Kamesh Kadimisetty,Biju R Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework combining large language models with real-world stock feedback for sentiment analysis in the Indian stock market, achieving better market alignment and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis methods fail to consider stock market feedback and its impact on sentiment alignment.

Method: The framework fine-tunes LLaMA 3.2 3B on the SentiFin dataset, integrates a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, employs a feedback-driven module using stock return-sentiment alignment, and incorporates a PPO-based reinforcement learning agent.

Result: Experimental results on NIFTY 50 data (2024-2025) show improved accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating instruction-tuned language models with dynamic stock feedback and reinforcement learning enhances financial sentiment analysis accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

Method: The researchers propose MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework with a two-stage training paradigm: (1) learning molecular editing and (2) optimizing properties. The agents utilize tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and refine their actions based on tool feedback.

Result: MolEditAgent and MolOptAgent, developed using this framework, outperform existing models in molecular editing and optimization tasks, demonstrating higher validity rates and improved optimization metrics like LogP.

Conclusion: The study shows that viewing molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process leads to more reliable and interpretable solutions, advancing the field of molecular design and optimization.

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

### [14] [Enhancing Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting in Off-the-Shelf LLMs via Noise Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20140)
*Xingyou Yin,Ceyao Zhang,Min Hu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using noise injection during tokenization to improve the robustness of off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to directly use pre-trained LLMs for time series forecasting without any fine-tuning, as existing methods often rely on specialized tuning or adaptations to make them suitable for this task.

Method: The authors introduce a simple yet effective strategy of injecting noise into raw time series data before converting it into tokens. This acts as inference-time augmentation, making the models rely on stable temporal patterns rather than artifacts.

Result: Through theoretical and empirical analyses, the study shows that noise injection enhances the performance of frozen LLMs. Two new datasets are introduced to avoid pre-training biases, and consistent performance improvements are reported.

Conclusion: The paper advances the paradigm of leveraging frozen LLMs for time series forecasting by introducing non-invasive noise-based augmentation strategies, improving robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

*Dhivya Dharshini Kannan,Anupam Trivedi,Dipti Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model to predict Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) in data centers, optimize energy efficiency, and compares its performance with GRU using a simulated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data centers consume significant energy and contribute to the carbon footprint. Optimizing energy efficiency is critical for IT sustainability and reducing costs. Predicting PUE helps target key factors affecting energy efficiency.

Method: A BiGRU model was developed to predict PUE. Relevant features were selected using the RFECV algorithm, and hyperparameters were optimized. The BiGRU's performance was compared to GRU using metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R-squared.

Result: BiGRU-based PUE prediction model demonstrated improved predictive performance compared to GRU.

Conclusion: The proposed BiGRU model optimizes PUE prediction effectively, enhancing energy efficiency in data centers and contributing to environmental sustainability.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares how humans and large language models (LLMs) generalize mathematical concepts, using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the differences in inference strategies and generalization capabilities between humans and LLMs.

Method: The authors used the number game conceptual inference task and analyzed human and LLM behavior through a Bayesian model.

Result: Humans demonstrated flexible inference strategies and strong few-shot generalization, whereas LLMs depended heavily on rule-based reasoning and required more examples to generalize.

Conclusion: The findings reveal significant differences in inductive biases and generalization approaches between humans and LLMs, emphasizing humans' adaptability in concept inference.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

### [17] [Offline Safe Policy Optimization From Heterogeneous Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20173)
*Ze Gong,Pradeep Varakantham,Akshat Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL), called PreSa, to directly learn safe and reward-maximizing policies without explicitly modeling reward and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety and reward alignment challenges in long-horizon continuous control tasks, where traditional methods fail due to errors in reward and cost accumulation.

Method: The paper proposes direct policy learning based on pairwise preferences for rewards and binary labels for safety, combined into a constrained optimization problem solved via a Lagrangian paradigm.

Result: The proposed method, PreSa, achieves superior safe policy learning with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and offline safe RL approaches using ground-truth reward and cost models.

Conclusion: PreSa demonstrates effectiveness in combining preference learning and safety alignment, overcoming limitations of previous approaches and achieving superior results in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

*Yuntao Dai,Hang Gu,Teng Wang,Qianyu Cheng,Yifei Zheng,Zhiyong Qiu,Lei Gong,Wenqi Lou,Xuehai Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework to enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models' performance for real-time tasks by improving inference speed on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of VLA models in real-world environments is limited by high inference latency, making smooth robotic interactions (20-30 Hz) unattainable with current models that operate at only 3-5 Hz.

Method: ActionFlow utilizes a novel Cross-Request Pipelining strategy for inference scheduling, along with memory-efficient computational approaches like the Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and Unified KV Ring Buffer.

Result: ActionFlow achieved a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model, enabling real-time manipulation without retraining.

Conclusion: ActionFlow bridges the gap in inference latency for resource-constrained edge platforms, achieving high-frequency, real-time performance suitable for dynamic robotic tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Conclusion: TongSIM is positioned as a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform that accelerates embodied intelligence research by offering versatility, scalability, and robust training capabilities.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

### [20] [MemR$^3$: Memory Retrieval via Reflective Reasoning for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20237)
*Xingbo Du,Loka Li,Duzhen Zhang,Le Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemR$^3$, an autonomous memory retrieval system, which outperforms existing methods by optimizing quality through closed-loop mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems in LLMs primarily focus on storage and compression, lacking emphasis on controlled and transparent memory retrieval.

Method: The proposed MemR$^3$ system integrates two mechanisms: a router for optimizing answer quality and a global evidence-gap tracker for improving transparency and evidence collection.

Result: Empirical evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows MemR$^3$ surpasses previous systems, improving RAG by 7.29% and Zep by 1.94% using the GPT-4.1-mini backend.

Conclusion: MemR$^3$ provides a plug-and-play solution that advances memory retrieval and can augment existing memory systems effectively.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

*Divya Vijay,Vignesh Ethiraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes G-SPEC, a neuro-symbolic framework for achieving safer and more reliable orchestration in 5G Standalone and 6G networks, addressing limitations of both static automation and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from orchestration challenges in complex networks like 5G/6G, which static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning struggle to handle, while stochastic risks limit the reliability of LLM agents.

Method: The authors introduce G-SPEC, which combines a telecom-adapted LLM (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints for deterministic governance in probabilistic planning.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a 450-node 5G Core demonstrates zero safety violations and a 94.1% success rate in remediation, outperforming a baseline of 82.4%. Results also show scalability up to 100K-node topologies with acceptable latency.

Conclusion: G-SPEC effectively resolves safety and compliance risks in intent-based networking, proving its utility and scalability for next-gen network orchestration.

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of creating autonomous agents capable of synthesizing executable procedural memory from scratch.

Method: Utilizes a case study on cross-service orchestration tasks involving Outlook and OneDrive, addressing gaps in discovery, verification, decomposition, and scaling via a hypothesize-probe-code methodology.

Result: Achieved autonomous generation of robust, production-grade code for workflow orchestration tasks.

Conclusion: Agents can effectively transition to active workflow architects by overcoming structural gaps and utilizing scientific methodologies for autonomous skill generation.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

*Junren Li,Luhua Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative AI in chemistry struggles with producing synthesizable molecules. SynCraft resolves this by using Large Language Models for structural edits to ensure synthetic feasibility without compromising molecule novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The issue with generative AI in chemical research is that many generated molecules are not synthetically accessible, limiting practical utility.

Method: SynCraft utilizes Large Language Models, treating synthesis optimization as a structural editing problem instead of molecule generation, ensuring feasible and novel molecular designs.

Result: SynCraft surpasses current benchmarks by generating highly synthesizable and structurally faithful molecules. It also demonstrates expertise in chemical editing for specific inhibitors.

Conclusion: SynCraft provides a novel solution to synthesizability challenges in molecule generation by leveraging reasoning capabilities of LLMs and structural editing approaches.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bohrium+SciMaster as infrastructures that enable scaling 'agentic science' by creating an ecosystem for AI-powered workflows in scientific research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in scaling AI-driven scientific workflows, such as traceability issues, agent-readiness of tools, and systematic reuse limitations.

Method: Develop Bohrium (a traceable hub for AI tools and data) and SciMaster (an orchestrator for workflows), integrating them into a scientific intelligence substrate for reproducible and efficient workflows.

Result: Their application showcased significant efficiency improvements in scientific cycles and execution signals across diverse workflows at multi-million scale.

Conclusion: Bohrium+SciMaster provide promising solutions for scaling and improving agentic science, enhancing workflow traceability, modularity, and systematic development.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Result: GatorTron-Base achieved the best weighted recall (80.5%), but overall performance between LLMs and SLMs was similar.

Conclusion: LLMs do not outperform SLMs in clinical predictive tasks, and future development should focus on clinical trajectory modeling rather than simpler text-based tasks.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

*Zhiyi Duan,Xiangren Wang,Hongyu Yuan,Qianli Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the T-MED dataset and AAM-TSA model for teacher sentiment analysis, enabling better emotional data understanding through multimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies fail to capture the performative nature of teachers' emotional expression and neglect the role of instructional information in emotional analysis.

Method: The paper constructs a large-scale multimodal dataset (T-MED) with human-machine collaborative labeling and proposes the AAM-TSA model featuring asymmetric attention and hierarchical gating for improved sentiment analysis.

Result: Experimental evidence shows AAM-TSA significantly surpassing existing methods in accuracy and interpretability using the T-MED dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal data and asymmetric attention mechanisms enhances teacher sentiment analysis, offering practical implications for educational settings.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: The study developed an LLM-based automated system, SAGE, for SRS treatment planning, demonstrating improved performance in cochlear dose reduction and providing transparent optimization processes through reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opacity of black-box AI systems in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and improve their clinical adoption by incorporating rational chain-of-thought reasoning into automated planning.

Method: Developed two variants of SAGE (with and without reasoning) and compared their performance in generating SRS treatment plans for 41 patients with brain metastases based on dosimetric endpoints and deliberative planning behaviors.

Result: The reasoning SAGE model achieved dosimetric performance comparable to human planners on main metrics. It reduced cochlear dose significantly and exhibited systematic reasoning in constraint verification and trade-offs, unlike the non-reasoning model.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning in automated planning improves transparency, making AI solutions for SRS more auditable and clinically viable, as demonstrated by the reasoning capabilities and performance of the SAGE agent.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

*Runtao Liu,Ziyi Liu,Jiaqi Tang,Yue Ma,Renjie Pi,Jipeng Zhang,Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent framework to improve reasoning over long video episodes without losing temporal grounding or fine details, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing long-video QA methods that rely on lossy content summaries and limited toolsets, which compromise accuracy and temporal grounding.

Method: The proposed method involves a master LLM coordinating a multi-agent system that includes a grounding agent for segment localization and a vision agent for fine-grained textual extraction, trained with reinforcement learning.

Result: The multi-agent system substantially outperforms traditional non-agent baselines on new datasets LongTVQA and LongTVQA+, derived from TVQA/TVQA+, and reinforcement learning enhances reasoning and efficiency.

Conclusion: The methodology provides effective, interpretable, and precise reasoning capabilities for long-video question answering, offering improved performance and better temporal and detail grounding.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

*Hongyang Shang,Shuai Dong,Ye Ke,Arindam Basu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D Stack In-Sensor-Computing (3DS-ISC) architecture for efficient event-based vision processing, achieving significant power, latency, and area reductions while maintaining high performance in vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in event-based vision processing by integrating sensing, memory, and computation in a streamlined architecture, overcoming challenges like the memory wall and reducing hardware overhead.

Method: The authors propose a 3DS-ISC architecture utilizing real-time normalization via exponential decay, DRAM leakage characterization, a custom MOMCAP for charge storage, and a low-leakage switch. This architecture combines sensing, memory, and computation to optimize efficiency.

Result: The architecture achieved reductions in area, power, and latency by 69x, 2.2x, and 1.9x respectively compared to a 2D counterpart, while reducing SRAM power by three orders of magnitude. It delivered comparable or state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision tasks (e.g., N-MNIST: 99%, N-Caltech101: 85%).

Conclusion: 3DS-ISC demonstrates efficient real-time event-based processing, competing with state-of-the-art systems in accuracy and efficiency. This work opens pathways for advanced computational circuit integration in broader applications.

Abstract: This work proposes a 3D Stack In-Sensor-Computing (3DS-ISC) architecture for efficient event-based vision processing. A real-time normalization method using an exponential decay function is introduced to construct the time-surface, reducing hardware usage while preserving temporal information. The circuit design utilizes the leakage characterization of Dynamic Random Access Memory(DRAM) for timestamp normalization. Custom interdigitated metal-oxide-metal capacitor (MOMCAP) is used to store the charge and low leakage switch (LL switch) is used to extend the effective charge storage time. The 3DS-ISC architecture integrates sensing, memory, and computation to overcome the memory wall problem, reducing power, latency, and reducing area by 69x, 2.2x and 1.9x, respectively, compared with its 2D counterpart. Moreover, compared to works using a 16-bit SRAM to store timestamps, the ISC analog array can reduce power consumption by three orders of magnitude. In real computer vision (CV) tasks, we applied the spatial-temporal correlation filter (STCF) for denoise, and 3D-ISC achieved almost equivalent accuracy compared to the digital implementation using high precision timestamps. As for the image classification, time-surface constructed by 3D-ISC is used as the input of GoogleNet, achieving 99% on N-MNIST, 85% on N-Caltech101, 78% on CIFAR10-DVS, and 97% on DVS128 Gesture, comparable with state-of-the-art results on each dataset. Additionally, the 3D-ISC method is also applied to image reconstruction using the DAVIS240C dataset, achieving the highest average SSIM (0.62) among three methods. This work establishes a foundation for real-time, resource-efficient event-based processing and points to future integration of advanced computational circuits for broader applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAR, an algorithm-hardware co-design to optimize memory and computational efficiency for Transformer inference under large-scale token parallelism, achieving significant improvements in speed, energy, and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies of existing dynamic sparsity accelerators in handling high-throughput inference requirements under large-scale token parallelism (LTPP).

Method: Designing STAR, a memory and compute-efficient framework incorporating log-domain sparsity prediction, FlashAttention optimization, and tiling strategies, supported by a novel accelerator architecture.

Result: STAR achieves up to 9.2× speedup and 71.2× energy efficiency compared to an NVIDIA A100, surpassing state-of-the-art accelerators in energy and area efficiency.

Conclusion: STAR effectively demonstrates the potential of cross-stage coordination to optimize Transformer inference in LTPP scenarios, delivering significant performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on self-attention for contextual understanding, demanding high-throughput inference and large-scale token parallelism (LTPP). Existing dynamic sparsity accelerators falter under LTPP scenarios due to stage-isolated optimizations. Revisiting the end-to-end sparsity acceleration flow, we identify an overlooked opportunity: cross-stage coordination can substantially reduce redundant computation and memory access. We propose STAR, a cross-stage compute- and memory-efficient algorithm-hardware co-design tailored for Transformer inference under LTPP. STAR introduces a leading-zero-based sparsity prediction using log-domain add-only operations to minimize prediction overhead. It further employs distributed sorting and a sorted updating FlashAttention mechanism, guided by a coordinated tiling strategy that enables fine-grained stage interaction for improved memory efficiency and latency. These optimizations are supported by a dedicated STAR accelerator architecture, achieving up to 9.2$\times$ speedup and 71.2$\times$ energy efficiency over A100, and surpassing SOTA accelerators by up to 16.1$\times$ energy and 27.1$\times$ area efficiency gains. Further, we deploy STAR onto a multi-core spatial architecture, optimizing dataflow and execution orchestration for ultra-long sequence processing. Architectural evaluation shows that, compared to the baseline design, Spatial-STAR achieves a 20.1$\times$ throughput improvement.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Nebula is a scalable framework for improving large-scale 3D Gaussian splatting collaborative rendering by reducing data communication and improving rendering speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of scalability in large-scale 3D Gaussian splatting and the bandwidth limitations for delivering high-quality VR content from the cloud.

Method: Nebula reduces data communication by streaming intermediate results after LoD (Level of Detail) search, employs temporal-aware LoD search to exploit temporal coherence, and introduces stereo rasterization for efficient rendering.

Result: Nebula achieves a 2.7x motion-to-photon speedup and reduces bandwidth requirements by 1925% compared to video streaming.

Conclusion: Nebula presents a significant advancement for scalable and efficient large-scale 3D Gaussian splatting rendering, providing smooth and high-fidelity VR experiences with reduced hardware requirements.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the architectural community recently. However, current architectural designs often overlook the 3DGS scalability, making them fragile for extremely large-scale 3DGS. Meanwhile, the VR bandwidth requirement makes it impossible to deliver high-fidelity and smooth VR content from the cloud.
  We present Nebula, a coherent acceleration framework for large-scale 3DGS collaborative rendering. Instead of streaming videos, Nebula streams intermediate results after the LoD search, reducing 1925% data communication between the cloud and the client. To further enhance the motion-to-photon experience, we introduce a temporal-aware LoD search in the cloud that tames the irregular memory access and reduces redundant data access by exploiting temporal coherence across frames. On the client side, we propose a novel stereo rasterization that enables two eyes to share most computations during the stereo rendering with bit-accurate quality. With minimal hardware augmentations, Nebula achieves 2.7$\times$ motion-to-photon speedup and reduces 1925% bandwidth over lossy video streaming.

### [35] [HARMON-E: Hierarchical Agentic Reasoning for Multimodal Oncology Notes to Extract Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19864)
*Shashi Kant Gupta,Arijeet Pramanik,Jerrin John Thomas,Regina Schwind,Lauren Wiener,Avi Raju,Jeremy Kornbluth,Yanshan Wang,Zhaohui Su,Hrituraj Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study presents a novel framework using large language models (LLMs) to extract structured oncology data from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) notes, achieving high accuracy and reducing annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured extraction of oncology data from EHR notes is critical for cancer treatment and research but is challenged by data variability, specialized terminology, inconsistent formats, and contradictory information. Manual methods are costly and automated solutions remain insufficient.

Method: The study introduces an agentic framework involving LLMs acting as reasoning agents with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis to extract structured clinical variables from oncology notes. The approach was applied to over 400,000 clinical notes for 2,250 cancer patients.

Result: The proposed method achieved an average F1-score of 0.93, with most oncology-specific variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables surpassing 0.95. It also achieved a 0.94 direct manual approval rate when integrated into a data curation workflow, greatly reducing annotation costs.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrated the feasibility of using LLM-based agents for comprehensive and scalable oncology data extraction, providing a new approach for structured data generation from unstructured medical records at scale.

Abstract: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

*Kirk Vanacore,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies the performance of large language models (LLMs) in classifying instructional moves in real classroom transcripts, comparing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques. Few-shot prompting improved performance significantly but revealed limitations in capability and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the out-of-the-box capabilities of LLMs in authentic educational settings without heavy customization, ensuring proper expectations as LLMs are increasingly used in education.

Method: The authors compared six LLMs using zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques to classify instructional moves in classroom transcripts and evaluated their baseline performance.

Result: Few-shot prompting significantly improved the models, with the strongest configuration achieving Cohen's Kappa of 0.58 against expert annotations. Performance was uneven, varying across instructional moves, with higher recall often causing more false positives.

Conclusion: Foundation models reveal meaningful capacity for interpreting instructional discourse but still face reliability and performance limitations; prompt design can enhance their abilities but cannot fully resolve constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

### [37] [Counterfactual LLM-based Framework for Measuring Rhetorical Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19908)
*Jingyi Qiu,Hong Chen,Zongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework that disentangles rhetorical style from substantive content in machine learning papers, using LLMs to analyze rhetorical patterns and their implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about exaggerated rhetoric, or `hype`, in AI/ML papers have grown, but there is a lack of reliable ways to quantify rhetorical style separately from the substance of the content.

Method: The authors developed a counterfactual LLM-based framework, where LLM rhetorical personas generate writings based on the same content, an LLM judge evaluates them, and statistical methods aggregate results to study rhetorical styles in ML papers.

Result: The analysis of 8,485 ICLR submissions showed that visionary rhetoric predicts increased citations and media attention, even after accounting for peer reviews. There was also a sharp increase in rhetorical strength post-2023, attributed to LLM-based writing tools.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective tools for quantifying rhetorical styles, their impact on attention, scientific evaluation, and can help improve writing and evaluation practices in AI/ML research through systematic analysis.

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

*Zhixiang Lu,Xueyuan Deng,Yiran Liu,Yulong Li,Qiang Yan,Imran Razzak,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRISM, a model integrating emotional and decision-making processes tailored to individual personality types, addressing limitations in traditional opinion dynamics models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ABMs often oversimplify individual psychological tendencies, hindering the understanding of polarization and ideological amplification online.

Method: PRISM combines stochastic differential equations for emotional development and PC-POMDP for decision-making, incorporating MBTI-based personality policies for agents initialized by social media data.

Result: PRISM shows better alignment with human psychological consistency compared to standard benchmarks, replicating key social phenomena like rational suppression and affective resonance.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a novel, effective method for studying online polarization and enhances the understanding of complex social media dynamics.

Abstract: Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) of opinion dynamics often fail to capture the psychological heterogeneity driving online polarization due to simplistic homogeneity assumptions. This limitation obscures the critical interplay between individual cognitive biases and information propagation, thereby hindering a mechanistic understanding of how ideological divides are amplified. To address this challenge, we introduce the Personality-Refracted Intelligent Simulation Model (PRISM), a hybrid framework coupling stochastic differential equations (SDE) for continuous emotional evolution with a personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision process (PC-POMDP) for discrete decision-making. In contrast to continuous trait approaches, PRISM assigns distinct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based cognitive policies to multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, initialized via data-driven priors from large-scale social media datasets. PRISM achieves superior personality consistency aligned with human ground truth, significantly outperforming standard homogeneous and Big Five benchmarks. This framework effectively replicates emergent phenomena such as rational suppression and affective resonance, offering a robust tool for analyzing complex social media ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates tone biases in conversational systems powered by large language models, revealing systematic and measurable tonal skew that can impact user trust and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how tone biases in large language models can subtly influence user perceptions of trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue systems.

Method: The study integrates dialogue synthesis through controllable large language models with tone classification models, develops two synthetic dialogue datasets (neutral and guided for positive/negative tones), and employs tone labeling using a pretrained DistilBERT model with classifiers trained for robust detection of bias.

Result: Even 'neutral' language model prompts exhibited tone bias. Ensemble models trained for tone detection achieved up to 0.92 macro F1 scores, confirming the presence and measurability of tonal biases.

Conclusion: Tone bias is an inherent trait of large language models, and its detection is critical for creating fair, ethical, and trustworthy conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

TL;DR: This paper introduces "ThinkARM," a framework to dissect reasoning traces in language models into distinct steps such as Analysis, Explore, and Verify, enabling better understanding of their reasoning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to go beyond surface-level statistics in evaluating reasoning traces of large language models by identifying their cognitive structures and steps.

Method: The authors use Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to create "ThinkARM," a framework that organizes reasoning traces into functional steps, applied to mathematical problem solving across different models.

Result: This framework revealed differences in reasoning dynamics between reasoning and non-reasoning models and highlighted exploration as critical for correctness, while efficient models selectively suppress feedback steps.

Conclusion: Episode-level abstractions enable a clearer analysis of reasoning processes in language models and provide insights to structure and assess their thinking.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

Method: Memory-T1 utilizes reinforcement learning with a coarse-to-fine strategy, including initial pruning with temporal and relevance filters and detailed evidence selection guided by multi-level reward functions focusing on accuracy, grounding, and temporal consistency.

Result: Memory-T1 achieves state-of-the-art 67.0% performance on the Time-Dialog benchmark, surpasses a 14B model baseline by 10.2%, and maintains robustness up to 128k tokens.

Conclusion: The framework is effective in enhancing temporal reasoning in dialogues, tackling noise, and providing scalability; its approach sets new benchmarks in conversational systems addressing extended contexts.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

### [42] [A Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20097)
*Zuo Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TextGSL, a novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for text classification, addressing structural and sequence learning limitations in existing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based methods for text classification do not fully exploit diverse structural relationships and sequence information, limiting their effectiveness in classifying texts with new words and relations.

Method: TextGSL constructs text-level graphs for each text, incorporates diverse edge types based on relationships, and uses adaptive multi-edge message-passing along with Transformer layers to capture both structural and sequential information.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that TextGSL significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: TextGSL effectively addresses existing limitations by enhancing text representation learning, combining structural and sequential information, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in text classification tasks.

Abstract: Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.

### [43] [ABBEL: LLM Agents Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20111)
*Aly Lidayan,Jakob Bjorner,Satvik Golechha,Kartik Goyal,Alane Suhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ABBEL, a framework for creating concise contexts in long sequential tasks using a belief state stored in natural language, and enhances it via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential tasks often require computationally impractical memory for full interaction histories. This paper aims to address that by developing a system that maintains task relevance with reduced memory usage.

Method: ABBEL replaces full interaction history with a dynamic belief state, updated at each task step. RL techniques like belief grading and length penalties are used to further refine the agent's belief states.

Result: ABBEL supports interpretable beliefs and efficient memory usage across diverse tasks. RL enhances ABBEL's performance, surpassing the full context setting while using less memory.

Conclusion: ABBEL with RL post-training improves task performance and memory efficiency, offering a promising solution for long sequential decision-making without reliance on full context.

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes M$^3$KG-RAG, an enhanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for the audio-visual domain, aiming to improve reasoning and response accuracy in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the audio-visual domain is challenged by limitations in existing multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) such as restricted modality coverage, inadequate multi-hop connectivity, and retrieval methods that fail to eliminate redundant or irrelevant information.

Method: The authors introduce M$^3$KG-RAG, which employs a new multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG) construction using a lightweight multi-agent pipeline. It retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge through modality-specific queries and integrates GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), a technique to ground entities, assess relevance, and filter redundant context.

Result: Experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrated that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly improves multimodal reasoning and grounding capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: M$^3$KG-RAG offers an effective solution for advancing the capabilities of MLLMs in audio-visual tasks by addressing existing limitations in MMKGs through its innovative retrieval and pruning mechanisms.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a module enhancing iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems for better retrieval precision and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems struggle with inefficient reasoning and retrieval processes, leading to suboptimal performance when handling complex questions.

Method: EKA aligns language models with the retrieval corpus before planning, using contextually retrieved knowledge, and operates as a training-free inference strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on six standard datasets show EKA improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, enhances performance and efficiency, and scales well to larger models.

Conclusion: EKA establishes a stronger reasoning foundation, improves iterative systems' performance and robustness, and emphasizes the interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning frameworks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RetroPrompt enhances generalization by leveraging a retrieval mechanism with pre-trained foundation models (PFMs), improving zero-shot and few-shot performances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional prompt learning for PFMs faces challenges such as overfitting to shallow patterns and limited efficacy with atypical instances due to reliance on parametric learning.

Method: RetroPrompt incorporates a publicly available knowledge base and uses a retrieval mechanism across input, training, and inference stages to decouple knowledge from memorization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance of RetroPrompt across multiple datasets in both zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: RetroPrompt reduces reliance on rote memorization in PFMs, striking a balance between generalization and memorization for improved multimodal learning.

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model that resolves challenges in joint speech-text learning and exhibits advanced capabilities in speech-to-text, reasoning, and voice empathy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address key challenges faced by existing joint speech-text models, such as temporal resolution mismatch, computational inefficiency, and text LLM knowledge loss.

Method: The model employs Dual-Resolution Speech Representations for balanced token processing, Core-Cocktail Training to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance various capabilities. It utilizes pre-trained models instead of large-scale pre-training.

Result: Fun-Audio-Chat achieves top performance on tasks like Speech-to-Text, Speech-to-Speech, Spoken QA benchmarks, as well as Audio Understanding and Instruction-Following.

Conclusion: Fun-Audio-Chat demonstrates advanced multi-modal capabilities, with its open-source design making it accessible for further use and research in voice-based interactions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in LLMs caused by hidden adversarial instructions and introduces benchmarks and defenses for resume screening applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and mitigate security vulnerabilities in LLMs when exposed to adversarial instructions in applications like resume screening.

Method: The authors introduced a benchmark for resume screening and evaluated defense mechanisms such as prompt-based methods and FIDS using LoRA adaptation.

Result: FIDS achieved a 15.4% attack reduction with a 10.4% false rejection increase, and combined with prompt-based methods, a total attack reduction of 26.3%.

Conclusion: Training-time defenses like FIDS are more effective than inference-time mitigation strategies, offering better security and utility preservation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text comprehension and generation, making them ideal for automated tasks like code review and content moderation. However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.

Method: FaithLens uses LLM-synthesized training data, data filtering strategies, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning for optimizing binary predictions and explanations.

Result: Tests on 12 tasks demonstrate that FaithLens (8B-parameter model) surpasses GPT-4.1 and o3 in performance, delivering better efficiency and explanation quality.

Conclusion: FaithLens provides a trustworthy, efficient, and effective solution for faithfulness hallucination detection, improving reliability in LLM outputs through robust explanations.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic evaluation tools for speech processing and translation systems facilitating communication among people without a shared language.

Method: The creation of a corpus comprising recordings, transcripts, translations, and written meeting summaries, with misunderstandings manually annotated and automatic detection tested using large language models.

Result: The Gemini model achieved recall of 77% and precision of 47% in detecting misunderstandings from text spans.

Conclusion: The corpus supports advancements in speech translation, cross-lingual summarization, and automatic misunderstanding detection in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SlideTailor, a system for automatic, user-aligned slide generation based on user-specified preferences using paper-slide example pairs and templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic slide generation systems fail to accommodate individual user preferences effectively, requiring novel approaches to tailor slides based on implicit inputs.

Method: SlideTailor uses paper-slides example pairs and visual templates to learn user preferences implicitly. It incorporates a chain-of-speech mechanism for aligning oral narration with slide content.

Result: SlideTailor achieves effective custom slide generation, demonstrated through a benchmark dataset and robust evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generates tailored slides, enhancing usability and enabling applications like video presentations, marking progress in customizable automatic content creation.

Abstract: Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing moderation tools that treat safety risks and adversarial threats as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability.

Method: Developed AprielGuard, trained on a diverse array of open and synthetic data using a unified taxonomy and structured reasoning traces for interpretability.

Result: AprielGuard outperforms existing tools, such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning-intensive situations.

Conclusion: Releasing AprielGuard aims to enhance research transparency and reproducibility while providing a robust safeguard framework for conversational and agentic LLM deployments.

Abstract: Safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against unsafe or adversarial behavior is critical as they are increasingly deployed in conversational and agentic settings. Existing moderation tools often treat safety risks (e.g. toxicity, bias) and adversarial threats (e.g. prompt injections, jailbreaks) as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability. We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios. By releasing the model, we aim to advance transparent and reproducible research on reliable safeguards for LLMs.

TL;DR: The study found that LLMs (specifically Gemini Pro models) outperformed mental health professionals in diagnosing BPD and NPD using Polish-language autobiographical accounts but exhibited shortcomings, particularly underdiagnosing NPD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increased use of LLMs for psychiatric evaluations requires analysis of their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives compared to human expertise.

Method: The research compared diagnoses made by state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals for BPD and NPD using first-person Polish-language accounts.

Result: Gemini Pro models were 21.91% more accurate overall in diagnostics compared to human professionals, excelling at BPD diagnosis but significantly underperforming in NPD detection.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong competence in interpreting complex clinical narratives but face reliability and bias concerns, particularly in diagnosing terms like "narcissism."

Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.

TL;DR: SpidR introduces a highly effective self-supervised speech representation model for textless language modeling enabling faster and higher-quality semantic extraction directly from speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates to improve efficiency and accessibility in modeling spoken languages.

Method: Developed SpidR, a model trained on raw waveforms using masked prediction, self-distillation, and online clustering for stable and high-quality semantic extraction.

Result: SpidR surpasses existing models like wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, in both language modeling benchmarks and reduces pretraining time significantly to one day on 16 GPUs.

Conclusion: SpidR efficiently advances textless language modeling while making pretraining faster and opens up easier experimentation with open-source availability.

Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit partial reasoning abilities for Bangla riddles but fall short of human-level understanding, highlighting the need for improvements and positioning BanglaRiddleEval as a valuable benchmark for low-resource studies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning. All data, code, and evaluation scripts are available on GitHub: https://github.com/Labib1610/BanglaRiddleEval.

*Nilesh Jain,Seyi Adeyinka,Leor Roseman,Aza Allsop*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel validation framework for using large language models (LLMs) in thematic analyses, combining ensemble validation and dual reliability metrics for increased reliability in qualitative research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the reliability challenges in traditional qualitative research methods which require time-intensive human coders and often yield moderate consistency.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-perspective validation framework combining ensemble validation with Cohen's Kappa for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency, evaluated across three LLMs on a single dataset.

Result: The framework validated high agreement between the LLMs tested, with Gemini achieving the highest reliability, followed by GPT-4o and Claude. The framework extracts reliable consensus themes with varying consistency per model.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential for LLMs to augment qualitative research reliability, offering an open-source, flexible framework to enhance methodology and establish reliable AI-assisted thematic analysis.

Abstract: Qualitative research faces a critical reliability challenge: traditional inter-rater agreement methods require multiple human coders, are time-intensive, and often yield moderate consistency. We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($κ$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($κ= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($κ= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($κ= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($κ> 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes. Our open-source implementation provides researchers with transparent reliability metrics, flexible configuration, and structure-agnostic consensus extraction, establishing methodological foundations for reliable AI-assisted qualitative research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sentiment-aware summarization framework for user-generated content by extending extractive and abstractive methods with sentiment elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of sentiment integration in summarization models for unstructured, emotion-rich, user-generated text.

Method: The paper embeds sentiment signals into TextRank (extractive) and UniLM (abstractive) techniques to improve summarization outcomes.

Result: The proposed methods capture emotional nuances and thematic relevance, creating concise, sentiment-enriched summaries for actionable insights.

Conclusion: The framework benefits timely interventions and decision-making in dynamic online settings by providing emotion-aware, improved summaries.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of unstructured data from social media, reviews, and forums, text mining has become essential in Information Systems (IS) for extracting actionable insights. Summarization can condense fragmented, emotion-rich posts, but existing methods-optimized for structured news-struggle with noisy, informal content. Emotional cues are critical for IS tasks such as brand monitoring and market analysis, yet few studies integrate sentiment modeling into summarization of short user-generated texts. We propose a sentiment-aware framework extending extractive (TextRank) and abstractive (UniLM) approaches by embedding sentiment signals into ranking and generation processes. This dual design improves the capture of emotional nuances and thematic relevance, producing concise, sentiment-enriched summaries that enhance timely interventions and strategic decision-making in dynamic online environments.

TL;DR: Introduces Step-DeepResearch for autonomous LLM agents, emphasizing cost-effective, robust open-ended research capabilities through novel methodologies and extensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp fail to address real-world demands in open-ended deep research, such as intent recognition, decision-making, and cross-source verification, thus necessitating a new approach.

Method: Step-DeepResearch integrates a Data Synthesis Strategy for planning/reporting, employs a progressive training strategy involving agentic mid-training, SFT, and RL, and incorporates a Checklist-style Judger for improved robustness. Evaluation was extended via the newly established ADR-Bench.

Conclusion: Refined training methods and novel evaluation benchmarks enable medium-scale LLMs to achieve expert-level performance in cost-efficient ways, validating Step-DeepResearch as a significant advancement.

Abstract: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

### [59] [Distilling to Hybrid Attention Models via KL-Guided Layer Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20569)
*Yanhong Li,Songlin Yang,Shawn Tan,Mayank Mishra,Rameswar Panda,Jiawei Zhou,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient method to convert pretrained Transformers into hybrid architectures using importance-based layer selection and distillation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs) without expensive pretraining from scratch by selectively converting certain layers to linear attention.

Method: Layer importance scores derived from minimal training on generic text data dictate layer selection, followed by distillation techniques like attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL distribution matching, and light finetuning.

Result: Results show the proposed approach outperforms uniform conversion heuristics and diagnostic-dataset-based methods in terms of layer selection performance.

Conclusion: Efficient hybrid architectures can be created from pretrained LLMs using a layer importance-based selection method combined with a robust distillation pipeline, enhancing efficiency without additional pretraining costs.

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

### [60] [Can LLMs Predict Their Own Failures? Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20578)
*Amirhosein Ghasemabadi,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Gnosis," a lightweight self-awareness mechanism to help large language models (LLMs) predict their own errors by analyzing internal states during inference, improving accuracy and efficiency without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are fluent but often generate incorrect outputs or hallucinations. Current methods to detect mistakes are computationally expensive or weakly reliable.

Method: Gnosis decodes signals from hidden states and attention patterns to perform intrinsic self-verification, compressing internal traces and predicting correctness with minimal cost using an additional ~5M parameters.

Result: Gnosis consistently outperformed internal baselines and external judges in math reasoning, question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, while generalizing to zero-shot scenarios for early failure detection.

Conclusion: Reliable correctness cues are inherently present in LLM inference processes, and Gnosis efficiently extracts them for improved self-verification without relying on external supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

### [61] [Cube Bench: A Benchmark for Spatial Visual Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20595)
*Dhruv Anand,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cube Bench is proposed as a Rubik's-cube-based benchmark for assessing spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically evaluate the ability of MLLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks, emphasizing spatial and sequential reasoning.

Method: The authors evaluated seven MLLMs using a shared set of scrambled Rubik's cube states, considering tasks like reconstructing cube faces, choosing moves, multi-step planning, and error recovery.

Result: Accuracy of MLLMs dropped sharply with increased Rubik's cube complexity, and models showed difficulty recovering from stalled trajectories. Closed-source models outperformed open-source ones, though even the best degraded at higher complexities.

Conclusion: Cube Bench serves as a reliable tool to probe spatial reasoning in MLLMs, highlighting limitations in current models' performance under complex conditions.

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: MoE-DiffuSeq improves the efficiency and expressiveness of long document generation using diffusion models through sparse attention and mixture of experts architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with computational and memory inefficiencies for long text sequences. There is a need for scalable and efficient solutions for extended text generation.

Method: MoE-DiffuSeq employs a mixture of experts framework and a customized sparse attention mechanism, alongside a soft absorbing state for better sequence modeling and precision.

Result: Experiments show that MoE-DiffuSeq enhances efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness in generating coherent long documents.

Conclusion: MoE-DiffuSeq advances diffusion model capabilities for high-quality long-form text generation with improved scalability and performance.

Abstract: We present MoE-DiffuSeq, a mixture of experts based framework for enhancing diffusion models in long document generation. Existing diffusion based text generation models, such as DiffuSeq, suffer from high computational cost and memory overhead when applied to extended sequences. To address these challenges, MoE-DiffuSeq integrates sparse attention with a mixture of experts architecture, enabling efficient and scalable long sequence modeling. Our approach introduces a customized sparse attention mechanism designed to reduce computational complexity while preserving text quality and coherence. In addition, we incorporate a soft absorbing state within the diffusion process to accelerate sequence reconstruction and improve generation precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoE-DiffuSeq significantly improves training efficiency and sampling speed compared to existing diffusion models. These advantages are particularly effective for long document scenarios, including scientific article generation, code repository modeling, and long form dialogue generation. Benchmark results further show that MoE-DiffuSeq improves efficiency, speed, accuracy, and expressiveness, advancing the practical applicability of diffusion models for high quality long form text generation.

*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHANTOM, a physical adversarial attack method using anamorphic art to exploit connected autonomous vehicles' vulnerabilities, achieving high attack success rates and causing system-wide disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to physical adversarial attacks that exploit perception systems and communication links.

Method: PHANTOM leverages geometrically distorted anamorphic art to deceive CAV vision systems without model access. It operates in black-box settings and is tested across different detector architectures through simulations and co-simulations.

Result: PHANTOM achieves over 90% attack success rate in ideal conditions and 60-80% in degraded settings, while also disrupting communication networks and degrading safety-critical information dissemination in connected ecosystems.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant vulnerabilities in CAV perception and communication systems, demonstrating the need for robust defenses against physical adversarial threats.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

*SaiKiran Tedla,Kelly Zhu,Trevor Canham,Felix Taubner,Michael S. Brown,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a technique that utilizes a pre-trained video diffusion model to derive information about a scene's past, present, and future from motion-blurred images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods in recovering complex scene dynamics and predicting prior or subsequent events from motion-blurred images.

Method: The method leverages a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on large-scale datasets to recover dynamic scenes and events before, during, and after a motion-blurred image capture.

Result: The proposed technique surpasses prior methods in performance, generalizes to diverse 'in-the-wild' scenarios, and facilitates downstream applications like camera trajectory recovery and 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: By repurposing a video diffusion model, the approach provides a robust solution to infer complex scene dynamics from motion-blurred images, setting a new standard for this task.

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address failures in existing autofocus systems and meet the demand for post-capture focus adjustment.

Method: Utilizes video diffusion models to generate a focal stack (as a video sequence) from one defocused image, allowing interactive refocusing.

Result: The method surpasses existing techniques in perceptual quality and robustness, even in challenging real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The approach enhances focus-editing in photography, with the provided dataset and open-source code fostering future research in this area.

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research.

*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits scoring functions for geometric models in robust fitting, analyzing MAGSAC++ and proposing a new evaluation methodology, finding no major performance distinctions among existing scoring functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine and improve scoring functions for robust geometric fitting, addressing inconsistencies in current methods and providing a unified theoretical framework.

Method: The study extends scoring functions to spherical noises, integrates threshold-based parameterization for probabilistic and robust fitting, analyzes MAGSAC++, and evaluates scoring functions using both large and small validation datasets.

Result: The analysis reveals inconsistencies in MAGSAC++, demonstrates numerical equivalency to simpler models, and establishes that all scoring functions perform equivalently in evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified theoretical and experimental perspective on scoring functions and highlights the lack of performance differences, emphasizing the need for robust evaluation methods for future research.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyGE-Occ, a new framework for improving 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction by focusing on geometric consistency and boundary awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with maintaining precise geometry and accurately capturing the spatial range of 3D instances necessary for effective panoptic separation in dense volumetric scene mapping.

Method: HyGE-Occ utilizes a hybrid view-transformation branch that integrates Gaussian-based depth representation and discretized depth-bin formulation, alongside edge cues from BEV features, to achieve improved geometric and structural coherence in 3D scene mapping.

Result: Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset show that HyGE-Occ outperforms previous methods, achieving superior 3D geometric reasoning.

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ improves the precision in geometric reasoning and spatial representation for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction, making it better suited for complex environments.

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code), tackling the challenge of transforming UI widgets into executable code with a new benchmark and baseline system for enhanced perceptual understanding and code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UI2Code has focused on web and mobile UIs, leaving app widgets underexplored due to their compact, proprietary nature and lack of accessible markup.

Method: The authors create an image-only widget benchmark and fine-tuned evaluation metrics while developing a system, WidgetFactory, which includes WidgetDSL for framework-agnostic code generation and adaptive rendering.

Result: Generalized multimodal models outperform specialized methods but exhibit inconsistencies; WidgetFactory shows substantial improvement in visual fidelity and compactness constraints.

Conclusion: WidgetFactory establishes a strong baseline for future exploration of Widget2Code research, addressing previous limitations with reliable code generation and rendering refinements for compact widgets.

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeurAlign, a deep learning framework for joint cortical and subcortical brain MRI registration, combining both volumetric and surface-based alignments for anatomically accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inconsistencies in traditional brain MRI registration methods, which often separate volumetric and surface-based alignment, hindering downstream analyses.

Method: NeurAlign employs an intermediate spherical coordinate space to unify surface and volumetric alignments and integrates spherical registration into learning for better geometric coherence.

Result: NeurAlign achieves up to 7-point Dice score improvements, provides regular deformation fields, is significantly faster than traditional methods, and requires only MRI scans as inputs.

Conclusion: NeurAlign advances brain MRI registration with increased accuracy, speed, and simplicity, setting a new standard for consistent cortical and subcortical alignment.

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

*Wentao Wu,Xiao Wang,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VehicleMAE-V2, a vehicle-centric pre-trained model based on multimodal priors, aiming to enhance vehicle perception representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained models struggle with effectively learning vehicle-related knowledge, affecting general vehicle perception capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes modules (SMM, CRM, SRM) that incorporate symmetry, contour, and semantics to improve masked token reconstruction during pre-training.

Result: VehicleMAE-V2 was trained on the large-scale dataset Autobot4M and achieved superior results across five downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Structured multimodal priors significantly boost vehicle-centric representation learning, offering advanced performance for vehicle perception tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

### [71] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH) to interpret vision transformer (ViT) depth as a block-recurrent system where computation can be reduced to a few repeated layers, offering a simpler computational perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear dynamical framework for understanding the computational depth structure of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which is currently lacking.

Method: The authors introduced the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH) and created block-recurrent surrogate models (Raptors) to approximate pre-trained ViTs efficiently. They tested BRH experimentally and analyzed ViT dynamics through Dynamical Interpretability.

Result: The BRH was empirically validated, with a Raptor model achieving 96% of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy using just two blocks. Key dynamical behaviors such as token-specific dynamics and low rank updates were discovered.

Conclusion: A compact block-recurrent computational structure emerges in ViTs, allowing for low-complexity interpretability via dynamical systems analysis, enabling a principled understanding of these models.

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360 introduces a novel framework for text- and mask-guided editing in 360° panoramas, improving existing methods in realism and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for editing 360° panoramas produce suboptimal results in visual quality and semantic fidelity, highlighting the need for enhanced methods.

Method: SE360 employs a coarse-to-fine data generation pipeline using Vision-Language Models and projection adjustments to analyze scenes hierarchically. This allows creation of high-quality datasets for training a Transformer-based diffusion model.

Result: Through experiments, SE360 delivers superior visual quality and semantic accuracy in edited 360° panoramas, compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SE360 demonstrates a successful approach to 360° panorama editing, setting new benchmarks for quality, realism, and flexibility in multi-condition text-guided image manipulation.

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

*Zixuan Huang,Xiang Li,Zhaoyang Lv,James M. Rehg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Video Foundation Models (VidFMs), trained on large-scale video data, exhibit 3D understanding without explicit 3D training and finds that such models possess strong 3D awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if 3D awareness naturally emerges in VidFMs when pretrained solely on large 2D video datasets, and to explore the implications for scalable 3D model development.

Method: A model-agnostic framework is proposed to quantify 3D understanding in VidFMs. The 3D properties are evaluated using shallow read-outs from the features of various pretrained VidFMs.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models were found to demonstrate significant 3D understanding, often surpassing expert models specifically trained on 3D tasks, despite no exposure to 3D data.

Conclusion: VidFMs can achieve a strong understanding of 3D concepts simply through extensive training on video data, providing insights that could guide the development of effective and scalable 3D models.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HistoWAS, a computational framework that links tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes by employing spatial and topological features from GIS and an association study inspired by PheWAS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools lack the ability to measure spatial interactions of tissue characteristics and relate them to clinical parameters, which limits biomedical insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs).

Method: A computational framework, HistoWAS, extends tissue analysis with 30 GIS-inspired spatial features and statistical tools for mass univariate regression, enabling in-depth tissue biomarker exploration.

Result: HistoWAS was validated using 385 WSIs from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project, showing its capability to analyze both conventional and newly-introduced spatial features.

Conclusion: HistoWAS provides a novel method for linking tissue micro-architecture to clinical outcomes and facilitates biomarker discovery, with the code made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method called WSD-MIL to improve diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology using efficient attention mechanisms in MIL frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing MIL methods, such as ignoring instance relationships in WSIs and the computational inefficiency of Transformer-based models.

Method: The authors propose WSD-MIL, which includes a window-scale decay-based attention module to handle local relationships at varying scales and a squeeze-and-excitation module for better global modeling.

Result: WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art results on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing computational memory usage by 62%.

Conclusion: WSD-MIL effectively enhances modeling of tumor regions in WSIs, balances performance and efficiency, and shows strong potential for improving computational pathology workflows.

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CNN and machine learning models for efficient guava disease detection using the GFDD24 dataset, achieving high accuracy to aid Bangladesh's agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance guava production by early detection of diseases and improve agricultural economic contribution in Bangladesh.

Method: The authors employ CNN and machine learning techniques, specifically ensemble models (CNNML + Gradient Boosting Machine), for classification with high accuracy.

Result: Proposed method achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 99.99% for guava disease detection.

Conclusion: The CNN-ML framework is highly effective for real-time monitoring of guava diseases, supporting agriculture in Bangladesh.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

*Robert van de Ven,Trim Bresilla,Bram Nelissen,Ard Nieuwenhuizen,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of automating apple pose estimation in orchards by proposing a novel pipeline that reconstructs orchard scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, significantly reducing manual annotations while improving pose estimation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify apple pose estimation in orchards, dealing with issues such as environmental variation, occlusions, and time-intensive annotations, to improve the automation of orchard-related tasks.

Method: The proposed method uses a pipeline with 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct orchard scenes, allowing simplified annotations, automated annotation projection onto images, and improved training of a pose estimation method.

Result: The method reduced manual annotations by 99.6% (from 105 to 28,191 labels). It achieved an F1 score of 0.927 on original images and 0.970 on rendered images. Accuracy decreased with higher occlusion and the model struggled with learning orientation estimation.

Conclusion: The pipeline significantly simplifies annotation efforts and enhances pose estimation performance, particularly for less occluded fruits, although limitations remain in accurately estimating occluded fruit orientations.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDTM, a dual-branch framework for high-resolution land cover mapping using coarse labels, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in cross-resolution land cover mapping caused by resolution mismatch and improve supervision and mapping accuracy.

Method: Introduces DDTM with dual branches: diffusion-based refinement for local semantics and a transformer-based global context branch, along with a confidence evaluation module.

Result: DDTM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with 66.52% mIoU on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, outperforming prior approaches.

Conclusion: DDTM demonstrates significant improvement in weakly supervised land cover mapping, addressing challenges from resolution mismatches effectively and delivering superior mapping accuracy.

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIVA, a lightweight adapter for diffusion models that facilitates image animation with precise motion control and high-quality results, even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the limitations of diffusion models in image animation due to scarcity of video training data and lack of generalization to new motion patterns.

Method: The proposed solution, MIVA, consists of modular lightweight sub-networks attachable to pretrained diffusion models. These sub-networks are designed to learn specific motion patterns and can be scaled through parallelization. They are efficiently trained on about ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU.

Result: Experiments show that MIVA enables precise motion control while maintaining or improving the generation quality, outperforming models trained on larger datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MIVA approach significantly enhances diffusion models' capability for image animation, providing better motion control and generation quality while being resource-efficient for training.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

*Ji Song,Xing Wang,Jianguo Wu,Xiaowei Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel anomaly detection method called Texture Basis Integrated Smooth Decomposition (TBSD) for textured images, addressing issues like misidentification and dataset dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods for textured defect images often struggle with accuracy, robustness, and dependency on large, structured datasets.

Method: The TBSD method involves learning texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic texture patterns and leveraging this information to enhance anomaly detection.

Result: The TBSD approach demonstrates better performance than benchmarks, with reduced misidentification, lower training dataset requirements, and enhanced accuracy on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TBSD effectively addresses the limitations of conventional methods, improving accuracy and reducing reliance on large datasets for textured image anomaly detection.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaSeRS, a large-scale dataset, and SegEarth-R2, an advanced model for handling complex geospatial language-guided segmentation challenges such as granularities, multi-target instructions, and implicit intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current models in accurately interpreting complex language commands for geospatial segmentation in remote sensing applications.

Method: The authors developed LaSeRS as a benchmarking dataset focusing on hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. They also proposed SegEarth-R2 architecture with spatial attention supervision and a flexible segmentation query mechanism.

Result: SegEarth-R2 demonstrated outstanding performance in handling complex segmentation tasks using the LaSeRS dataset and surpassed other benchmarks.

Conclusion: LaSeRS and SegEarth-R2 collectively advance capabilities in geospatial segmentation, providing a strong baseline and new evaluation standards in remote sensing by overcoming real-world sensitivity challenges.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of combining driver-facing and road-facing camera views on distracted driving detection, finding that outcomes vary depending on model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing distracted driving detection models that neglect environmental context by relying solely on driver-facing views.

Method: The study evaluated three spatiotemporal action recognition architectures (SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50) using real-world driving datasets in both single (driver-only) and dual-view (driver + road) input configurations.

Result: Results demonstrated that dual-view inputs improved detection accuracy in some models, such as a 9.8% improvement with SlowOnly, but led to performance drops in others like SlowFast (-7.2%), indicating a dependency on architecture design.

Conclusion: Integrating context from road-facing views can enhance distracted driving detection but requires architecture designed for effective multi-view fusion to avoid representational conflicts.

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the misalignment between expert demonstrations and student observations that causes poor imitation learning performance in simulated driving tasks.

Method: The paper analyzes asymmetries in visibility, uncertainty, and navigational intent between experts and students. It proposes modifications to narrow these gaps and integrates perception supervision in simulation-to-reality tasks.

Result: Their TransFuser v6 policy achieved state-of-the-art performance on major CARLA benchmarks and improved results on NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Conclusion: Eliminating expert-student asymmetries and enhanced perception modeling demonstrably improves driving policy robustness and reliability. Their open-source contributions further promote practical advancements in autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

*Ziwei Qin,Xuhui Song,Deqing Huang,Na Qin,Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPI-GNN, a novel graph neural network approach that creates patient-specific multimodal graph profiles for improved medical diagnosis, significantly enhancing performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the shortcomings of static, single-graph approaches in medical diagnosis which fail to model patient-specific pathological relationships.

Method: MAPI-GNN introduces a multi-dimensional approach where latent graph-aware patterns are identified, used to construct dynamic activation graphs, and processed through a relational fusion engine.

Result: Experiments conducted on over 1300 patient samples across two tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN effectively addresses the limitations of static graph paradigms by dynamically modeling multifaceted graph profiles, leading to improved diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [86] [$\text{H}^2$em: Learning Hierarchical Hyperbolic Embeddings for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20029)
*Lin Li,Jiahui Li,Jiaming Lei,Jun Xiao,Feifei Shao,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes H2em, a framework for compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) using hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings to better model and generalize hierarchical structures in unseen compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current CZSL methods, which fail to effectively scale and generalize under large-scale hierarchical taxonomies due to the constraints of Euclidean space.

Method: The authors introduce H2em, which utilizes hyperbolic geometry for embedding hierarchical structures and adds two learning objectives: Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss and Discriminative Alignment Loss, alongside Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three CZSL benchmarks, proving effective for both closed-world and open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: H2em demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging hyperbolic geometry for better modeling hierarchical structures, showing potential for real-world CZSL applications.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

### [87] [VALLR-Pin: Dual-Decoding Visual Speech Recognition for Mandarin with Pinyin-Guided LLM Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20032)
*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VALLR-Pin, a two-stage framework for Mandarin Visual Speech Recognition, combining phonetic and linguistic features to handle the challenges of ambiguity and homophones in Mandarin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin Visual Speech Recognition is particularly difficult due to the high ambiguity of visemes and the prevalence of homophones, requiring novel approaches to achieve higher accuracy.

Method: The VALLR-Pin framework includes a video encoder with dual decoders to predict Chinese characters and Pinyin. It refines outputs using a large language model (LLM) with explicit phonetic context and fine-tuning through synthetic noisy examples.

Result: The proposed method enhances Mandarin lip-reading performance by integrating robust visual-semantic representations and addressing model-specific error patterns.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin successfully improves Mandarin Visual Speech Recognition by synergizing visual, phonetic, and linguistic contexts and equipping the LLM to handle phonetic errors effectively.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

### [88] [FlashLips: 100-FPS Mask-Free Latent Lip-Sync using Reconstruction Instead of Diffusion or GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20033)
*Andreas Zinonos,Michał Stypułkowski,Antoni Bigata,Stavros Petridis,Maja Pantic,Nikita Drobyshev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashLips is a mask-free lip-sync system achieving real-time performance at over 100 FPS with high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a lip-sync system that is both fast and visually accurate, addressing limitations of larger models' speed and complexity while eliminating reliance on GANs or diffusion methods.

Method: FlashLips uses a two-stage approach: first, a latent-space editor for reconstruction without GANs, and second, an audio-to-pose transformer for lip movement prediction, combined with self-supervision for fine-tuning.

Result: The system achieves over 100 FPS on a single GPU, matching the visual realism of larger models, while being simpler and more efficient.

Conclusion: FlashLips offers a robust, efficient, and high-quality pipeline for real-time lip synchronization that sets a benchmark for performance and simplicity.

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

*Nguyen Lam Phu Quy,Pham Phu Hoa,Tran Chi Nguyen,Dao Sy Duy Minh,Nguyen Hoang Minh Ngoc,Huynh Trung Kiet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal system combining visual input and external textual knowledge to create contextually rich image captions, showing its effectiveness on the OpenEvents v1 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Richer image captions are needed for journalism, education, and archives, as existing captions lack necessary contextual depth like events, temporal aspects, and named entities.

Method: The system retrieves semantically similar images (BEIT-3 and SigLIP), reranks with ORB and SIFT, retrieves context from articles, and uses a Qwen3 fine-tuned model to enrich captions by integrating this context with base captions.

Result: The model significantly enhances caption informativeness compared to traditional methods, tested on the OpenEvents v1 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach demonstrates strong potential in generating context-enriched image captions, addressing limitations of traditional image captioning systems.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

TL;DR: The paper introduces PICM-Net, a progressive image compression codec designed for machine perception, featuring adaptive decoding with high classification task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore progressive image compression (FGS) for machine-oriented codecs, addressing real-world adaptive requirements.

Method: Developed PICM-Net using trit-plane coding, prioritizing machine-perception rate-distortion strategies, and introduced adaptive decoding controller for inference.

Result: Achieved efficient transmission and high classification task performance, demonstrating adaptability and machine-aware compression.

Conclusion: PICM-Net establishes a novel approach for adaptable, machine-aware progressive image compression.

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

*Jinyoung Choi,Youngchae Kwon,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN), which improves accuracy by analyzing item-specific features, their combinations, and global appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion style classification is complicated due to visual variation within the same style and the resemblance of different styles. The aim is to improve style classification using advanced feature analysis techniques.

Method: The study proposes the IRSN framework which uses item region pooling (IRP) for extracting item-specific features, gated feature fusion (GFF) for combining them, and a dual-backbone architecture combining domain-specific and general feature extractors.

Result: IRSN improved style classification accuracy by average 6.9%-7.6% and maximum 14.5%-15.1% on FashionStyle14 and ShowniqV3 datasets respectively. Visualization shows improved differentiation between similar styles.

Conclusion: IRSN is effective at handling complexities in fashion style classification by combining item region-specific and global features using advanced techniques.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of activation functions and model optimizers on Human Activity Recognition using BiLSTM and ConvLSTM architectures, showing ConvLSTM paired with Adam or RMSprop offers superior performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to fill the gap in understanding how activation functions and model optimizers influence Human Activity Recognition models, especially in healthcare applications requiring precision and robust design.

Method: The researchers use BiLSTM and ConvLSTM architectures, combining three activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad), testing them on activity classes from HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets.

Result: ConvLSTM outperformed BiLSTM across datasets, achieving 99% accuracy with Adam or RMSprop optimizers, while BiLSTM showed limited robustness, particularly on the HMDB51 dataset.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that ConvLSTM combined with Adam or RMSprop is optimal for precise and robust Human Activity Recognition systems in healthcare settings, offering valuable guidance for future model optimization.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

TL;DR: This paper proposes LiDARDraft, a system for generating controllable and realistic LiDAR point clouds using versatile user inputs by bridging the gap between input signals and complex distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of achieving high-quality and controllable LiDAR point cloud generation, improving autonomous driving simulations.

Method: Utilizing 3D layouts derived from text, images, and sketches as intermediate signals, paired with a rangemap-based ControlNet for point cloud generation.

Result: LiDARDraft demonstrates excellent performance in generating controllable and realistic LiDAR point clouds based on diverse inputs.

Conclusion: LiDARDraft successfully establishes a method for generating simulation environments from varied input types like texts and images, enhancing autonomous driving capabilities.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

*Thanh-Tung Le,Tuan Pham,Tung Nguyen,Deying Kong,Xiaohui Xie,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid framework for novel view synthesis, combining a deterministic network for observed areas and a diffusion-based approach for unobserved areas, resulting in high-quality, efficient rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing NVS methods, which either render blurry unseen regions (deterministic methods) or require high computational costs (stochastic diffusion-based methods).

Method: The method employs a bidirectional transformer to encode multi-view tokens and ray embeddings, producing a shared representation. Two separate heads handle rendering: one for geometry-constrained regions and another for occluded areas using masked autoregressive diffusion. The entire system is trained end-to-end.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art image quality while significantly reducing rendering time compared to fully generative baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines deterministic and stochastic approaches, leading to scalable, efficient, and photorealistic NVS across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-modal attention network combining radar and thermal data for automated bridge deck defect detection, achieving better accuracy than single-mode approaches, though it struggles with extreme data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve automated inspection methods for civil infrastructure, overcoming the limitations of visual assessments and single-modal technologies like radar and thermography.

Method: The authors developed a multi-modal attention network using temporal attention for radar data, spatial attention for thermography, and cross-modal fusion with learnable embeddings. Uncertainty quantification is added via Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation.

Result: The proposed system outperformed baseline methods on five bridge datasets in accuracy and AUC. It demonstrated significant improvements in defect detection through attention mechanisms, though extreme class imbalance posed challenges.

Conclusion: The system excels in balanced scenarios but requires specialized techniques for extreme class imbalance. It supports real-time inspection, providing actionable insights into the method's strengths and deployment limits.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDAVS, an improved framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation, addressing challenges like multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Audio-Visual Segmentation methods often struggle with biases caused by multi-source entanglement and misalignment between auditory and visual cues, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios.

Method: The method uses the DDAVS framework, which incorporates learnable queries and an audio prototype memory bank to disentangle audio semantics, combined with contrastive learning and dual cross-attention for better multimodal alignment.

Result: DDAVS outperformed previous methods in experiments on AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks, achieving strong results across different scenarios, including single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance cases.

Conclusion: DDAVS demonstrates high effectiveness and generalizability in addressing real-world audio-visual segmentation challenges.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

*Hao Guo,Xugong Qin,Jun Jie Ou Yang,Peng Zhang,Gangyan Zeng,Yubo Li,Hailun Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark named NL-DIR is proposed for retrieving document images using natural language queries with fine-grained semantics, overcoming limitations of prior coarse category-based DIR methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DIR methods struggle with retrieving document images based on fine-grained, semantically rich natural language queries, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduce a benchmark (NL-DIR) with 41K document images paired with textual queries and evaluate using contrastive vision-language models, OCR-free VDU models, and a two-stage retrieval approach.

Result: Evaluations demonstrated improved retrieval performance using the proposed techniques and benchmark, achieving better efficiency in time and space.

Conclusion: The NL-DIR benchmark opens up new avenues for research in the VDU community by enabling document image retrieval using semantic-rich natural language queries.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

TL;DR: HEART-ViT is an efficient framework for Vision Transformer optimization that combines token and head pruning using second-order methods, achieving significant reductions in computational cost and latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of Vision Transformers (ViTs) caused by quadratic attention cost and redundant computations, making them unsuitable for latency and resource-constrained platforms.

Method: HEART-ViT estimates the sensitivities of tokens and heads using Hessian-vector products to facilitate input-adaptive, curvature-driven pruning under explicit loss budgets.

Result: HEART-ViT achieved up to 49.4% FLOPs reduction, 36% lower latency, and 46% higher throughput on ImageNet datasets, while consistently maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy.

Conclusion: HEART-ViT demonstrates the feasibility of an accuracy-preserving, edge-efficient pruning framework that narrows the gap between theoretical optimization and practical deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

TL;DR: The paper presents milliMamba, a framework for radar-based 2D human pose estimation using spatio-temporal modeling. It effectively handles challenges like sparse radar signals and exceeds baseline performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of millimeter-wave radar signals for human pose estimation, such as sparsity due to specular reflection, and provide a lighting-invariant, privacy-preserving alternative to RGB sensors.

Method: The framework includes a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder for efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder to predict joint coordinates. It uses a velocity loss to enhance motion smoothness during training.

Result: MilliMamba achieved significant performance improvements of 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets, respectively, surpassing baseline methods.

Conclusion: MilliMamba demonstrates effective and robust performance in radar-based 2D human pose estimation by addressing spatio-temporal features, overcoming sparse reflections, and maintaining acceptable complexity.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

*Grega Šuštar,Jer Pelhan,Alan Lukežič,Matej Kristan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoDi, a latent diffusion-based low-shot object counting model that excels in high-quality density map creation and accurate object localization, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing low-shot object counters, especially in dense regions with numerous small objects, which struggle with localization and counting accuracy.

Method: The authors propose CoDi, a low-shot counter that uses a latent diffusion-based approach and an innovative exemplar-based conditioning module to improve prototype accuracy and density map quality for better object localization.

Result: CoDi achieved significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods: a 15% reduction in MAE on few-shot, 13% on one-shot, 10% on reference-less cases in FSC benchmarks, and 44% on the MCAC benchmark.

Conclusion: CoDi significantly enhances counting and localization in low-shot scenarios, setting new benchmarks and demonstrating strong performance, with its code made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

TL;DR: The study introduces Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts (AMoE) Vision Foundation Models for more efficient multi-teacher distillation, offering approaches to reduce computational cost and enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve the learning dynamics, computational cost, and data efficiency of multi-teacher distillation in vision foundation models.

Method: The approach involves designing AMoE models that distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 using an Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss, token-balanced batching for resolution stability, and hierarchical clustering of training data for better sample efficiency.

Result: The AMoE model trained on OpenLVD200M corpus demonstrates superior sample efficiency and effective knowledge transfer capabilities while reducing computational requirements compared to random sampling.

Conclusion: OpenLVD200M and the distilled AMoE models show potential in advancing efficient, unified visual representations through multi-teacher distillation techniques.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, utilizing latent spaces of VQ-VAE for improved image compression and human perception alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image compression approaches struggle to achieve both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrates because pixel-space distortions do not align well with human perception.

Method: The paper proposes the GLC architecture, utilizing generative latent space for transform coding, introducing a categorical hyper module for bit cost reduction, and enhancing semantic consistency with code-prediction-based supervision.

Result: With less than 0.04 bpp for natural images and less than 0.01 bpp for facial images, GLC provides high visual quality. On CLIC2020, it matches MS-ILLM's FID with 45% fewer bits. It also enables applications like image restoration and style transfer.

Conclusion: GLC effectively addresses pixel-space compression challenges, achieving efficient and perceptually aligned compression. Its versatile latent space benefits applications beyond compression, making it a promising advancement in the field.

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JDPNet, a deep learning framework addressing coupled degradation in underwater images by unifying and adjusting degradation features, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on separate handling of specific underwater image degradations but overlook the nonlinear interactions and couplings, limiting their efficiency in addressing complex degradations comprehensively.

Method: JDPNet combines a joint feature-mining module with a probabilistic strategy to process coupled degradation features and introduces AquaBalanceLoss to balance color, clarity, and contrast while training the system.

Result: JDPNet outperforms existing methods across six public underwater datasets and two new datasets, providing a better balance between performance, model size, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that JDPNet effectively tackles coupled degradations in underwater images, offering a unified solution with improved tradeoffs in performance, computational costs, and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

### [104] [LiteFusion: Taming 3D Object Detectors from Vision-Based to Multi-Modal with Minimal Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20217)
*Xiangxuan Ren,Zhongdao Wang,Pin Tang,Guoqing Wang,Jilai Zheng,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteFusion enhances 3D object detection for autonomous systems by minimally using LiDAR as complementary geometric information without heavy reliance on LiDAR-specific processing, achieving increased accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal 3D object detection systems overly depend on LiDAR, causing performance issues when LiDAR is unavailable and challenging deployment on non-GPU hardware due to 3D convolution reliance.

Method: LiteFusion abandons a dedicated LiDAR backbone, instead integrating LiDAR data as geometric enhancement to image features within a quaternion space for better cross-modal learning.

Result: LiteFusion improves detection accuracy significantly (+20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS) with minimal parameter increase (1.1%) and remains effective even without LiDAR input, according to experiments on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: LiteFusion demonstrates a novel, lightweight fusion approach for robust, deployable, multi-modal 3D object detection that overcomes the limitations of LiDAR dependence and hardware compatibility issues.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper presents IndicDLP, a large-scale dataset for document layout analysis, addressing the limitations of existing datasets in multilingual and domain diversity, particularly for Indic languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lack of diverse, fine-grained, and multilingual datasets for document layout comprehension, especially for underrepresented Indic scripts, hindering progress in digitization and OCR tasks.

Method: The authors introduce IndicDLP, a dataset covering 11 Indic languages and 12 document domains, and UED-mini, a dataset for enhanced pretraining, testing these resources through fine-tuning experiments on layout models.

Result: Fine-tuning on IndicDLP improved performance for document layout models, generalizing well across Indic scripts and beyond.

Conclusion: IndicDLP addresses a critical gap in multilingual document layout analysis datasets, enhancing model performance and paving the way for inclusive digitization solutions.

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

*Binfeng Wang,Di Wang,Haonan Guo,Ying Fu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified method called DAMP for hyperspectral image restoration without predefined degradation labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI restoration methods rely on predefined degradation priors, which are challenging to access due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world data.

Method: The proposed framework, Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP), quantifies multi-dimensional degradations as prompts and utilizes a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) in a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for dynamic feature learning.

Result: DAMP outperforms existing methods on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets, displaying high efficiency and adaptability to diverse degradations.

Conclusion: DAMP offers a robust, unified solution for HSI restoration, eliminating dependence on explicit degradation labels and providing significant practical benefits.

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the BiCoR-Seg framework to enhance high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation (HRSS), addressing inter-class similarity and intra-class variability. It features a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy module (HBIS) and a hierarchical supervision strategy for better feature discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation is to overcome the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability in HRSS, which hinder effective semantic segmentation and lead to class confusion in complex scenes.

Method: The authors propose the BiCoR-Seg framework featuring HBIS for bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings via heatmaps, a hierarchical supervision strategy for improved features, and a discriminative loss for better representation.

Result: BiCoR-Seg demonstrates excellent segmentation performance on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets, showing stronger interpretability and enhanced feature discrimination.

Conclusion: The research provides an innovative method to solve HRSS challenges, achieving better segmentation accuracy and interpretability compared to existing methods. The proposed framework sets a solid direction for future developments in remote sensing image segmentation.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LADLE-MM, a multimodal misinformation detection model requiring limited annotations and computational resources, achieving competitive and sometimes superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of realistic synthetic manipulations across multimedia, misinformation has spread widely, especially through social media. There is a need for efficient detection methods with limited dependency on extensive resources.

Method: The proposed method, LADLE-MM, uses a modular approach with unimodal and multimodal branches. It incorporates BLIP-based embeddings for enhancing image-text representations while maintaining a parameter-efficient model construction.

Result: LADLE-MM achieves state-of-the-art performance, despite operating with fewer trainable parameters, generalizes effectively to open-set settings, and proves robust against unimodal biases on datasets like DGM4 and VERITE.

Conclusion: LADLE-MM demonstrates that effective multimodal misinformation detection can be achieved without reliance on computationally heavy or resource-intensive models, marking a significant step forward in the domain.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

*Jiawei Ge,Jiuxin Cao,Xinyi Li,Xuelin Zhu,Chang Liu,Bo Liu,Chen Feng,Ioannis Patras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ${D}^{3}$ETOR is a weakly-supervised framework designed for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD). It improves the quality of pseudo labels and addresses scribble annotation biases to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of weakly-supervised COD methods, specifically the unreliable pseudo masks generated by general-purpose models and the neglect of annotation bias in scribbles.

Method: The proposed ${D}^{3}$ETOR framework consists of two stages: (1) Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling, which improves pseudo masks using entropy-driven sampling and a multi-agent debate mechanism, and (2) Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing, which introduces FADeNet to balance global and local modeling, while tackling scribble biases.

Result: ${D}^{3}$ETOR achieves a significant performance improvement over existing weakly-supervised COD techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method bridges the gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised COD by improving pseudo label precision and addressing annotation bias, showcasing its effectiveness in tackling visually concealed objects.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to address uncertainty in SHAP explanations for medical imaging using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for medical imaging, though effective, often lack explainability and stability in SHAP visualizations under uncertainty.

Method: The study leverages Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations, using a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach with statistical analysis.

Result: The framework was evaluated on three medical imaging datasets from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology to demonstrate its efficacy in handling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Conclusion: By quantifying uncertainty in SHAP explanations, the framework enhances reliability and interpretability in deep learning medical imaging models.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create more human-like conversational systems by integrating both audio and visual elements of communication, addressing gaps in prior studies that handle audio and video synthesis separately.

Method: The TAVID framework integrates face and speech generation using two cross-modal mappers (motion and speaker mappers) for synchronized audio-visual interactions.

Result: TAVID demonstrates effectiveness through evaluations in speaking face realism, listening responsiveness, interaction fluency, and speech quality, backed by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: TAVID successfully combines audio and visual modalities for synchronized conversational generation, advancing the development of interactive and human-like systems.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing video virtual try-on methods which struggle with fine-grained garment dynamics, background consistency, computational cost, and dataset quality.

Method: KeyTailor uses keyframe sampling to extract informative frames and employs tailored modules to enhance garment details and background optimization. The enriched information is injected into diffusion transformers without modifying their architecture, supported by the newly introduced ViT-HD dataset.

Result: KeyTailor achieves superior garment fidelity and background integrity compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across dynamic and static scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework improves virtual try-on realism while reducing complexity and enhancing generalization, supported by a large-scale dataset for better training and evaluation.

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

### [113] [CRAFT: Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning for Multimodal Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20362)
*V. Kovalev,A. Kuvshinov,A. Buzovkin,D. Pokidov,D. Timonin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT significantly improves text-to-image generation through structured, inference-time reasoning without requiring retraining, ensuring compositional accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to improving text-to-image generation lack interpretability, control, and reliability, motivating the need for structured inference-time reasoning.

Method: The authors propose CRAFT, a framework that breaks down prompts into dependency-structured visual questions, verifies images using vision-language models, and iteratively makes prompt refinements using large language models until constraints are met.

Result: CRAFT improves composition, text accuracy, and user preferences across benchmarks with minimal computational cost, even enabling smaller models to rival more powerful ones.

Conclusion: Structured, constraint-driven reasoning at inference-time is essential for enhancing the dependability and quality of multimodal image generation systems.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

*Linfei Li,Lin Zhang,Zhong Wang,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmartSplat, a novel framework improving image compression for ultra-high-resolution visuals using adaptive and feature-aware strategies, achieving better results over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in generative AI-generated ultra-high-resolution visuals demands efficient compression and real-time decoding to handle the large data sizes and performance requirements.

Method: The authors propose SmartSplat, which includes Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling and Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling to optimize Gaussian primitives for compression. It captures both local structures and global textures effectively.

Result: SmartSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of compression efficiency and image reconstruction quality on datasets such as DIV8K and an introduced 16K dataset.

Conclusion: SmartSplat demonstrates exceptional scalability, strong reconstruction fidelity under compression, and practical applicability in ultra-high-resolution image scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

*Junho Yoon,Jaemo Jung,Hyunju Kim,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes DETACH, a decomposed spatiotemporal framework for aligning exocentric video with ambient sensors, addressing the limitations of existing methods in local motion capture and context-aware alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using egocentric video and wearable sensors for action recognition have limitations in terms of comfort, privacy, and scalability, prompting exploration of non-intrusive alternatives like exocentric video with ambient sensors.

Method: The authors introduce a decomposed spatiotemporal framework, DETACH, which preserves local details and uses sensor-spatial features via online clustering for context-aware alignment. Alignment is done in two stages: spatial correspondence using mutual supervision, followed by temporal alignment with a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss.

Result: Experiments on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets show significant improvements over adapted baselines, validating DETACH's effectiveness.

Conclusion: DETACH effectively addresses issues of local detail preservation and context-aware alignment in exocentric-ambient settings, outperforming prior methods and demonstrating its potential for scalable, non-intrusive action recognition.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a reasoning framework that incorporates anomaly-focused bias to enhance crime detection performance in video surveillance using Large Vision-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models perform poorly in detecting crimes due to their bias towards normality, and current reasoning strategies lack inductive anomaly biases, making crime detection ineffective.

Method: The authors propose the CoAT framework, which employs multi-agent reasoning and introduces inductive criminal bias through a specialized anomaly-focused classification layer.

Result: CoAT improves Anomaly Detection performance with an 11.8 percentage point boost in F1-score for low-resolution footage and a 3.78 percentage point improvement in Anomaly Classification for high-resolution videos.

Conclusion: Incorporating criminal biases via CoAT demonstrates significant advancements in anomaly and crime detection, making automated video surveillance more effective.

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

*Anh Dao,Manh Tran,Yufei Zhang,Xiaoming Liu,Zijun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of physically inferred forces into motion understanding tasks and finds that it improves performance across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion understanding methods largely ignore physical cues like joint actuation forces, which are vital in biomechanics but often overlooked in favor of vision-based approaches.

Method: The authors incorporate physically inferred forces into established motion understanding pipelines to assess their impact across gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning tasks, evaluating performance on multiple benchmarks.

Result: Incorporating forces improved performance metrics across all tasks, such as a 0.87% accuracy improvement in CASIA-B gait recognition, a +2.00% accuracy gain in action recognition, and better temporal and semantic grounding in video captioning.

Conclusion: Incorporating biomechanical force cues enhances the robustness and effectiveness of motion understanding pipelines, particularly under challenging conditions such as occlusion or variations in appearance.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, enabling improvements in text rendering, especially for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address limitations in diffusion-based text-to-image models for text rendering performance in design applications, particularly improving the quality for small typography and supporting non-Latin scripts.

Method: The framework utilizes a new DiT-based text style transfer model trained on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating RGBA text foregrounds that mimic reference glyph styles. It also includes a conditional text generation model with a multi-modal encoder trained on detailed text-annotated datasets, and incorporates layout planning and text-to-image models in an automated T2D pipeline.

Result: UTDesign achieves better stylistic consistency and text accuracy compared to existing open-source methods, with notable advantages against proprietary alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully advances state-of-the-art automated graphic design and text rendering capabilities, offering versatile tools for English and Chinese script design applications.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research studies RGB and LWIR thermal fusion for detecting surface-laid landmines using UAS. YOLOv11 performed best in accuracy and training efficiency. Results highlight thermal fusion parameters and detection accuracy differences between Anti-Tank and Anti-Personnel mines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landmines continue to be a severe humanitarian threat, requiring efficient systems to detect and mitigate their presence.

Method: Adaptive thermal fusion of RGB and LWIR for UAS-based detection was evaluated using YOLO architectures, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and RF-DETR, along with multi-temporal datasets.

Result: YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance at 86.8% mAP and demonstrated faster training. RF-DETR had higher accuracy but slower training. Multi-temporal training improved detection accuracy by up to 9.6%. Detection rates differed for mine types due to size and thermal-mass differences.

Conclusion: YOLOv11 offers an optimal balance of efficiency and accuracy for operational deployment. Future research is needed on buried mines across diverse soil types.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness.

TL;DR: AlignPose is introduced for multi-view 6D object pose estimation leveraging extrinsically calibrated RGB views without object-specific training or symmetry annotation, outperforming previous methods on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view object pose estimation struggles with depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions, while multi-view approaches promise better results but face issues of dependency on single-view pose precision or lack of generalization.

Method: The authors propose AlignPose, a technique that aggregates multi-view RGB data. It uses a multi-view feature-metric refinement optimizing the object pose by minimizing feature discrepancy between the observed image features and on-the-fly rendered object model features across all views.

Result: Experiments across four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) demonstrate that AlignPose achieves superior performance, particularly excelling in challenging industrial scenarios within the BOP benchmark evaluation.

Conclusion: AlignPose improves multi-view object pose estimation by overcoming the drawbacks of single-view methods and prior multi-view approaches, offering better robustness and generalization to unseen objects.

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel approach that uses multi-level textual descriptions and modules to improve image fusion quality under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in image fusion arising from disparities in dynamic range and focus depth, enhanced by incorporating fine-grained textual descriptions for better cross-modal alignment.

Method: The proposed MTIF leverages multi-grained textual descriptions guided by hierarchical cross-modal modulation, supervised alignment signals across granularities, and a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment data and improve model performance.

Result: MTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-grained textual guidance improves cross-modal alignment and enhances image fusion quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MTIF framework.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with dynamic spatial reasoning due to the lack of scalable 4D training resources.

Method: A pipeline generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs leveraging in-the-wild videos, extracting geometric and motion data. A Geometry Selection Module (GSM) integrates geometric priors into VLMs.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves DSR capabilities in VLMs while retaining performance on general video tasks.

Conclusion: DSR Suite bridges the gap in DSR for VLMs by providing novel data, benchmark, and model integration for enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM offers enhanced visual token reduction for vision-language models using a text-guided selection method, achieving improved efficiency-performance trade-offs while preserving semantic alignment and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the inefficiency and redundancy in visual token processing for large vision-language models, aiming to improve token reduction techniques to reduce computational costs without degrading alignment with textual queries.

Method: FlashVLM employs a text-guided visual token selection framework, combining cross-modal similarity metrics and intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and diversity-preserving strategies for compression.

Result: FlashVLM achieves lossless compression or minor improvements over unpruned baselines, pruning up to 77.8% of visual tokens with strong performance across 14 benchmarks, even maintaining 92.8% accuracy at 94.4% token compression.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that FlashVLM delivers state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs, robustness, and generalization, ensuring effective compression without compromising semantic alignment or context.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiTracker, a state-of-the-art point tracking method utilizing video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), which demonstrate strong capabilities for handling dynamic motions and occlusions in video frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point tracking is essential for applications like 4D reconstruction and robotics, yet current methods lack temporal coherence and often fail under challenging conditions.

Method: DiTracker adapts video DiTs with query-key attention matching, lightweight LoRA tuning, and cost fusion with a ResNet backbone to enhance point tracking.

Result: DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on ITTO benchmarks and matches/exceeds other models on TAP-Vid benchmarks, even with smaller training batch sizes.

Conclusion: Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) provide an effective and efficient foundation for robust point tracking in videos, validated by the proposed DiTracker model's superior performance.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

*Daewoon Kim,Si Young Yie,Jae Sung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedPOD, an optimization approach for federated learning, aimed at enhancing training efficiency, reducing communication costs, and addressing limitations of existing methods like FedPIDAvg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve federated learning systems by tackling inefficiencies in training, high communication costs, and data usage restrictions due to existing methods.

Method: FedPOD eliminates reliance on prior learning information and includes previously excluded participants using validation loss calculations while being inspired by Kubernetes POD architecture for scalability.

Result: FedPOD achieves comparable performance to FedPIDAvg with average Dice scores of 0.78 (WT), 0.71 (ET), and 0.72 (TC). Its convergence score averages to 0.74, proving its potential.

Conclusion: FedPOD demonstrated improved efficiency, flexibility, and performance in federated learning, showing promise for scalable and effective training systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

*Xuanhua He,Tianyu Yang,Ke Cao,Ruiqi Wu,Cheng Meng,Yong Zhang,Zhuoliang Kang,Xiaoming Wei,Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORCA, a framework for video avatars that can actively plan and achieve long-term goals using adaptive interaction in generative environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current video avatar methods that excel at identity and motion but lack the ability for autonomous, goal-directed behavior.

Method: ORCA employs an Internal World Model (IWM) with the OTAR cycle for robust state tracking and a hierarchical dual-system architecture to perform reasoning and execute precise actions.

Result: ORCA outperformed baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence across multi-step tasks in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework advances video avatars from passive animation to active, intelligent agents capable of achieving long-term goals.

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

*Yuxi Xiao,Longfei Li,Shen Yan,Xinhang Liu,Sida Peng,Yunchao Wei,Xiaowei Zhou,Bingyi Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired framework for evaluating spatial abilities in multimodal language models (MLLMs) with a four-level hierarchy and reveals insights into skill transfer and reinforcement-learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of hierarchical spatial ability development in MLLMs, which is critical for tasks requiring spatial reasoning and interaction.

Method: The paper introduces SpatialTree, a hierarchical benchmark rooted in cognitive science, to evaluate 27 spatial sub-abilities across four levels (perception, mapping, simulation, agentic competence) and investigates performance dynamics using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Findings reveal that low-level (L1) skills are independent while higher-level skills interrelate due to increasing dependencies, with fine-tuning showing negative transfer within L1 but strong cross-level transfer. Reinforcement learning results highlight auto-think strategies as effective across all levels.

Conclusion: SpatialTree framework provides a novel approach to systematically understand, evaluate, and improve the spatial abilities of MLLMs, offering insights into skill interdependencies, transfer dynamics, and optimization strategies.

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemanticGen, a two-stage video generation model focusing on semantic space for faster convergence, better computational efficiency, and high-quality video outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of current video generative models, which struggle with slow convergence and high computational costs, especially for long videos.

Method: SemanticGen uses a two-stage generation process: (1) a diffusion model generates semantic video features for global planning, and (2) another diffusion model generates VAE latents, adding detail conditioned on these semantic features.

Result: SemanticGen achieves faster convergence, effective long video generation, and high computational efficiency, while outperforming state-of-the-art models in video quality.

Conclusion: SemanticGen provides a more efficient and high-quality solution to video generation by leveraging semantic space for the early stages of the generation process.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for efficient Distributed Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) and achieves significant performance improvements over existing baselines by addressing communication overhead issues through innovative strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the major performance bottleneck of high communication overhead found in existing implementations of distributed Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication.

Method: Two innovative strategies are introduced: a sparsity-aware communication strategy to reduce overhead and a hierarchical strategy combining sparsity-awareness with network architectures, optimized for GPU systems.

Result: Achieved strong scalability up to 128 GPUs with geometric mean speedups of up to 221.5× compared to state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework optimizes communication in distributed SpMM implementations, displaying outstanding scalability and significant performance boosts over existing methods.

Abstract: Distributed Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) is a fundamental operation in numerous high-performance computing and deep learning applications. The major performance bottleneck in distributed SpMM lies in the substantial communication overhead, which limits both performance and scalability. In this paper, we identify and analyze sources of inefficient communication in existing distributed SpMM implementations at two levels and address these inefficiencies by proposing: (1) a fine-grained, sparsity-aware communication strategy that reduces communication overhead by exploiting the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix, and (2) a hierarchical communication strategy that integrates the sparsity-aware strategy with the common two-tier network architectures in GPU-accelerated systems, to reduce redundant communication across slow network links. We implement these optimizations in a comprehensive distributed SpMM framework, \method{}. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that our framework demonstrates strong scalability up to 128 GPUs, achieving geometric mean speedups of 221.5$\times$, 56.0$\times$, 23.4$\times$, and 8.8$\times$ over four state-of-the-art baselines (CAGNET, SPA, BCL, and CoLa, respectively) at this scale.

TL;DR: UCCL-EP is a portable communication system for Mixture-of-Experts workloads, achieving high performance across various GPU and NIC platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art communication systems like DeepEP perform well but lack portability across diverse GPU and NIC architectures due to tight integration requirements.

Method: UCCL-EP uses a GPU-CPU control channel to enable GPUDirect RDMA operations via CPU proxies. It also emulates ordering semantics using RDMA immediate data to ensure compatibility with non-specialized NICs.

Result: Experiments show UCCL-EP outperforms existing solutions on AWS EFA by up to 2.1×, achieves equivalent performance to DeepEP on NVIDIA platforms, and enhances system throughput on heterogeneous systems by 40-45%.

Conclusion: UCCL-EP is a versatile and high-performing solution for expert parallelism in MoE workloads, bridging portability gaps across different hardware platforms.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) workloads rely on expert parallelism (EP) to achieve high GPU efficiency. State-of-the-art EP communication systems such as DeepEP demonstrate strong performance but exhibit poor portability across heterogeneous GPU and NIC platforms. The poor portability is rooted in architecture: GPU-initiated token-level RDMA communication requires tight vertical integration between GPUs and NICs, e.g., GPU writes to NIC driver/MMIO interfaces.
  We present UCCL-EP, a portable EP communication system that delivers DeepEP-level performance across heterogeneous GPU and NIC hardware. UCCL-EP replaces GPU-initiated RDMA with a high-throughput GPU-CPU control channel: compact token-routing commands are transferred to multithreaded CPU proxies, which then issue GPUDirect RDMA operations on behalf of GPUs. UCCL-EP further emulates various ordering semantics required by specialized EP communication modes using RDMA immediate data, enabling correctness on NICs that lack such ordering, e.g., AWS EFA. We implement UCCL-EP on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with EFA and Broadcom NICs. On EFA, it outperforms the best existing EP solution by up to $2.1\times$ for dispatch and combine throughput. On NVIDIA-only platform, UCCL-EP achieves comparable performance to the original DeepEP. UCCL-EP also improves token throughput on SGLang by up to 40% on the NVIDIA+EFA platform, and improves DeepSeek-V3 training throughput over the AMD Primus/Megatron-LM framework by up to 45% on a 16-node AMD+Broadcom platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python's scientific computing ecosystem lacks efficient multi-node GPU support, particularly for hardware-adaptive, energy-efficient HPC workflows.

Method: Developing an adaptive framework using CharmTiles with a NumPy-like syntax, allowing dynamic resource scaling during execution, supported by Charm++ runtime.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated significant dynamic scalability and outperformed existing stencil DSLs and generalized solutions like NumPy replacements.

Conclusion: A resource-adaptive, scalable solution successfully integrates the ease of prototyping with high-performance multi-node GPU execution, addressing existing HPC limitations.

Abstract: The scientific computing ecosystem in Python is largely confined to single-node parallelism, creating a gap between high-level prototyping in NumPy and high-performance execution on modern supercomputers. The increasing prevalence of hardware accelerators and the need for energy efficiency have made resource adaptivity a critical requirement, yet traditional HPC abstractions remain rigid. To address these challenges, we present an adaptive, distributed abstraction for stencil computations on multi-node GPUs. This abstraction is built using CharmTyles, a framework based on the adaptive Charm++ runtime, and features a familiar NumPy-like syntax to minimize the porting effort from prototype to production code. We showcase the resource elasticity of our abstraction by dynamically rescaling a running application across a different number of nodes and present a performance analysis of the associated overheads. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our abstraction achieves significant performance improvements over both a specialized, high-performance stencil DSL and a generalized NumPy replacement.

Result: The paper categorizes existing works based on their handling of memory and knowledge, providing insights into the dynamics of KD in different collaborative learning setups.

Conclusion: The authors highlight challenges in KD for collaborative learning and propose future research directions for enhancing the techniques in this field.

Abstract: Collaborative learning has emerged as a key paradigm in large-scale intelligent systems, enabling distributed agents to cooperatively train their models while addressing their privacy concerns. Central to this paradigm is knowledge distillation (KD), a technique that facilitates efficient knowledge transfer among agents. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KD leverages memory and knowledge across agents remain underexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive review of KD in collaborative learning, with a focus on the roles of memory and knowledge. We define and categorize memory and knowledge within the KD process and explore their interrelationships, providing a clear understanding of how knowledge is extracted, stored, and shared in collaborative settings. We examine various collaborative learning patterns, including distributed, hierarchical, and decentralized structures, and provide insights into how memory and knowledge dynamics shape the effectiveness of KD in collaborative learning. Particularly, we emphasize task heterogeneity in distributed learning pattern covering federated learning (FL), multi-agent domain adaptation (MADA), federated multi-modal learning (FML), federated continual learning (FCL), federated multi-task learning (FMTL), and federated graph knowledge embedding (FKGE). Additionally, we highlight model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, resource heterogeneity, and privacy concerns of these tasks. Our analysis categorizes existing work based on how they handle memory and knowledge. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and propose future directions for advancing KD techniques in the context of collaborative learning.

Method: Gaian provides a unified API that supports existing PBDR methods while optimizing data locality to minimize communication and enhance efficiency during distributed training.

Result: Gaian achieves significant improvements, reducing communication overhead up to 91% and increasing training throughput by 1.50x-3.71x on six datasets using up to 128 GPUs.

Conclusion: Gaian successfully addresses the limitations of existing PBDR training systems by offering a generalized, efficient, and versatile platform for high-performance distributed training.

Abstract: Point-based Differentiable Rendering (PBDR) enables high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction, but scaling PBDR to high-resolution and large scenes requires efficient distributed training systems. Existing systems are tightly coupled to a specific PBDR method. And they suffer from severe communication overhead due to poor data locality. In this paper, we present Gaian, a general distributed training system for PBDR. Gaian provides a unified API expressive enough to support existing PBDR methods, while exposing rich data-access information, which Gaian leverages to optimize locality and reduce communication. We evaluated Gaian by implementing 4 PBDR algorithms.

Motivation: To address challenges with traditional data and model parallelism in handling the increasing scale of MPS in quantum applications, particularly memory constraints, scalability, and computational limitations.

Method: The authors propose Fast-MPS, which integrates data parallelism across samples with tensor parallelism along bond dimensions, while employing techniques like compression and overlapping to resolve memory and I/O bottlenecks.

Result: Fast-MPS achieves over a 10x speedup compared to existing simulators, scales to thousands of processes, and supports simulations with 8,176 sites and a bond dimension of chi = 10^4, surpassing previous performance benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fast-MPS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, showcasing its potential for large-scale MPS applications in high-performance tensor network computations.

Abstract: Matrix Product State (MPS) is a versatile tensor network representation widely applied in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and machine learning, etc. MPS sampling serves as a critical fundamental operation in these fields. As the problems become more complex, the scale of MPS is rapidly increasing. Traditional data parallelism is limited by memory and heavy I/O in large-scale MPS. Model parallelism that can handle large-scale MPS imposes rigid process bindings and lacks scalability. This work proposes Fast-MPS, a multi-level parallel framework for scalable MPS sampling. Our design combines data parallelism across samples with tensor parallelism along bond dimensions. We eliminate memory and I/O pressure through compression and overlapping, and revive data parallel in large-scale MPS sampling. We evaluate our approach on Gaussian Boson Sampling, a representative and demanding application. Fast-MPS achieves over 10x speedup compared to existing simulators, scales to thousands of processes, and enables simulations with 8,176 sites and bond dimension chi = 10^4, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Fast-MPS has demonstrated great potential in high-performance tensor network applications.

*Leszek Gąsieniec,Tytus Grodzicki,Tomasz Jurdziński,Jakub Kowalski,Grzegorz Stachowiak*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving efficient population protocols for congruency predicates like parity computation, and proposes robust and universal protocols using population weights, successfully achieving silent stabilization in $O(\log^3 n)$ time and state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency gap in solving congruency predicates such as parity computation within population protocols, which directly impacts distributed computing performance.

Method: A novel paradigm integrating population weights, robust clocking mechanisms, anomaly detection, and a switching mechanism for multistage stable population protocols.

Result: Developed efficient parity and congruence protocols utilizing $O(\log^3 n)$ states, with silent stabilization achieved in $O(\log^3 n)$ time.

Conclusion: The proposed protocols represent a significant advancement in universal and efficient design for population protocols, facilitating broader applications including sub-population size computations.

Abstract: For nearly two decades, population protocols have been extensively studied, yielding efficient solutions for central problems in distributed computing, including leader election, and majority computation, a predicate type in Presburger Arithmetic closely tied to population protocols. Surprisingly, no protocols have achieved both time- and space-efficiency for congruency predicates, such as parity computation, which are complementary in this arithmetic framework. This gap highlights a significant challenge in the field. To address this gap, we explore the parity problem, where agents are tasked with computing the parity of the given sub-population size. Then we extend the solution for parity to compute congruences modulo an arbitrary $m$.
  Previous research on efficient population protocols has focused on protocols that minimise both stabilisation time and state utilisation for specific problems. In contrast, this work slightly relaxes this expectation, permitting protocols to place less emphasis on full optimisation and more on universality, robustness, and probabilistic guarantees. This allows us to propose a novel computing paradigm that integrates population weights (or simply weights), a robust clocking mechanism, and efficient anomaly detection coupled with a switching mechanism (which ensures slow but always correct solutions). This paradigm facilitates universal design of efficient multistage stable population protocols. Specifically, the first efficient parity and congruence protocols introduced here use both $O(\log^3 n)$ states and achieve silent stabilisation in $O(\log^3 n)$ time. We conclude by discussing the impact of implicit conversion between unary and binary representations enabled by the weight system, with applications to other problems, including the computation and representation of (sub-)population sizes.

### [141] [Reaching Agreement Among Reasoning LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20184)
*Chaoyi Ruan,Yiliang Wang,Ziji Shi,Jialin Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes Aegean, a consensus protocol for stochastic reasoning agents, aiming to improve multi-agent reasoning by eliminating inefficiencies in static workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems lack dynamic orchestration, leading to wasted computation, slow performance due to stragglers, and unreliable agreements.

Method: The authors present a formal model for multi-agent refinement and introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol for stochastic agents within Aegean-Serve, which accelerates reasoning by detecting quorum early and allowing safe termination.

Result: Aegean demonstrates significant latency reductions (1.2–20×) while keeping answer quality high (within 2.5%) across benchmarks and deployment setups.

Conclusion: Consensus-based paradigms for multi-agent systems improve efficiency and reliability without compromising result accuracy, validated across local and commercial settings.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have extended the capability of agentic AI. Instead of single inference passes, multiple agents perform collective reasoning to derive high quality answers. However, existing multi-agent orchestration relies on static heuristic workflows such as fixed loop limits and barrier synchronization. These ad-hoc approaches waste computational resources, incur high latency due to stragglers, and risk finalizing transient agreements. We argue that reliable multi-agent reasoning requires a formal foundation analogous to classical distributed consensus problem.
  To that end, we propose a formal model of the multi-agent refinement problem. The model includes definitions of the correctness guarantees and formal semantics of agent reasoning. We then introduce Aegean, a consensus protocol designed for stochastic reasoning agents that solves multi-agent refinement. We implement the protocol in Aegean-Serve, a consensus-aware serving engine that performs incremental quorum detection across concurrent agent executions, enabling early termination when sufficient agents converge. Evaluation using four mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows that Aegean provides provable safety and liveness guarantees while reducing latency by 1.2--20$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art baselines, maintaining answer quality within 2.5%. Consistent gains across both local GPU deployments and commercial API providers validate that consensus-based orchestration eliminates straggler delays without sacrificing correctness.

*Yinan Ni,Xiao Yang,Yuqi Tang,Zhimin Qiu,Chen Wang,Tingzhou Yuan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a serverless system to optimize Large Language Model inference using proactive adapter management and memory optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address two critical challenges in serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs in serverless environments: reducing cold start latency and mitigating GPU memory fragmentation.

Method: P-LoRA employs a LSTM-based traffic predictor for proactive adapter loading and a page-based memory management mechanism inspired by virtual memory systems.

Result: P-LoRA reduces cold start latency by up to 68%, achieves a GPU memory utilization of over 87%, improves throughput by 1.52x compared to S-LoRA, and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% in high concurrency scenarios.

Conclusion: P-LoRA effectively optimizes serverless LLM inference by minimizing latency and maximizing memory efficiency, enhancing performance significantly over existing systems.

Abstract: The serverless computing paradigm offers compelling advantages for deploying Large Language Model (LLM) inference services, including elastic scaling and pay-per-use billing. However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.

### [143] [Resilient Packet Forwarding: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Routing in Gaussian Interconnected Networks with Clustered Faults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20394)
*Mohammad Walid Charrwi,Zaid Hussain*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing system for Gaussian Interconnected Networks to manage faults and congestion more effectively, significantly outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address faults and communication reliability challenges in Gaussian Interconnected Networks as they scale in size, which are particularly impacted by node and link failures.

Method: The study proposes a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RL routing protocol with a reward structure that avoids faulty regions and dynamically adapts to network conditions.

Result: The RL routing scheme achieves better results under both high fault density and low network load, maintaining a 0.95 Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) compared to 0.66 of the traditional greedy routing system at 40% fault density.

Conclusion: The RL-based routing approach demonstrates high efficacy in overcoming stochastic faults and congestion compared to traditional deterministic routing methods in Gaussian Interconnected Networks.

Abstract: As Network-on-Chip (NoC) and Wireless Sensor Network architectures continue to scale, the topology of the underlying network becomes a critical factor in performance. Gaussian Interconnected Networks based on the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, offer attractive properties regarding diameter and symmetry. Despite their attractive theoretical properties, adaptive routing techniques in these networks are vulnerable to node and link faults, leading to rapid degradation in communication reliability. Node failures (particularly those following Gaussian distributions, such as thermal hotspots or physical damage clusters) pose severe challenges to traditional deterministic routing. This paper proposes a fault-aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) routing scheme tailored for Gaussian Interconnected Networks. By utilizing a PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) agent with a specific reward structure designed to penalize fault proximity, the system dynamically learns to bypass faulty regions. We compare our proposed RL-based routing protocol against a greedy adaptive shortest-path routing algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL agent significantly outperforms the adaptive routing sustaining a Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of 0.95 at 40% fault density compared to 0.66 for the greedy. Furthermore, the RL approach exhibits effective delivery rates compared to the greedy adaptive routing, particularly under low network load of 20% at 0.57 vs. 0.43, showing greater proficiency in managing congestion, validating its efficacy in stochastic, fault-prone topologies

### [144] [WOC: Dual-Path Weighted Object Consensus Made Efficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20485)
*Tanisha Fonseca,Gengrui Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol designed to address both node heterogeneity and workload independence in distributed systems, achieving higher throughput and adaptability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consensus protocols struggle to simultaneously optimize for node heterogeneity and workload independence, which limits their efficiency in handling diverse operational conditions.

Method: The authors propose a dual-path consensus protocol, WOC, which routes operations based on access patterns: independent operations take a fast path using object-specific weighted quorums, while shared or conflicting operations go through a leader-coordinated slow path.

Result: WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput compared to Cabinet in workloads with over 70% independent objects, while maintaining similar performance under high contention conditions.

Conclusion: WOC successfully handles both independent and conflicting operations by efficiently leveraging object-specific weighted quorums and node-weighted consensus, making it suitable for heterogeneous and diverse workloads.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems face a critical challenge: existing consensus protocols optimize for either node heterogeneity or workload independence, but not both. For example, Cabinet leverages weighted quorums to handle node heterogeneity but serializes all operations through a global leader, limiting parallelism. EPaxos enables parallel execution for independent operations but treats all nodes uniformly, ignoring performance differences. To tackle this problem, we present WOC, a dual-path consensus protocol that dynamically routes operations into two paths based on their access patterns. Independent operations execute through a fast path that uses object-specific weighted quorums and completes in one network round-trip. Conflicting or shared objects route through a leader-coordinated slow path employing node-weighted consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates that WOC achieves up to 4X higher throughput than Cabinet for workloads with >70% independent objects, while maintaining equivalent performance under high contention.

*Taoran Sheng,Manfred Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores diverse learning paradigms for human activity recognition using wearable sensors, focusing on reducing labeling while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labeled data acquisition poses a challenge in wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR), motivating exploration of alternative learning methods.

Method: The paper investigates six learning paradigms, including fully supervised, unsupervised, weakly supervised, multi-task learning, self-supervised, and a novel weakly self-supervised framework.

Result: Experiments affirm that weakly supervised methods achieve competitive performance with reduced labeling, multi-task learning enhances via knowledge sharing, and weakly self-supervised methods excel with minimal labeling.

Conclusion: The novel weakly self-supervised framework efficiently addresses limited labeled data challenges in HAR applications while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

*Behrooz Mamandipoor,Chun-Nan Hsu,Martin Krause,Ulrich H. Schmidt,Rodney A. Gabriel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal deep learning model was developed to predict in-hospital mortality for critically ill ICU patients using diverse clinical data, with high accuracy and external validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the study was to assist clinicians in improving treatment decisions by enabling early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients.

Method: The authors developed a multimodal model that utilized structured and unstructured clinical data (e.g., time-invariant/variant variables, notes, and chest X-rays) from multiple datasets (MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, HiRID). External validation was performed for reliability.

Result: The model demonstrated high prediction accuracy with AUROC and AUPRC scores of 0.92 and 0.53 respectively for structured data, and external validations showed AUROCs of 0.84-0.92 across multiple institutions. Adding clinical notes and imaging data further improved the model's metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating diverse patient information significantly enhances mortality prediction, and external validation affirms the model's robustness across various clinical datasets.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

TL;DR: A framework called ICFA, which reuses proposal samplers and a similarity function, is introduced for effectively finding rare but important solutions across large candidate spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently identifying rare but valuable solutions in large candidate spaces, like in language generation and reinforcement learning.

Method: Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm (ICFA) that reweights sampling distributions using a combination of a proposal sampler and a similarity function, along with adaptive focusing strategies.

Result: ICFA shows practical applicability through two experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation, with theoretical explanations and diagnostic tools provided.

Conclusion: ICFA effectively reduces sample needs in complex search spaces, combining algorithmic reweighting with structured prompts for versatile applications.

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

TL;DR: This paper presents Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a Pythonic library for evaluating the fidelity of synthetic tabular data through metrics and visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data allows for innovation while maintaining privacy, but existing evaluation methods are fragmented and inadequate.

Method: They introduce SDB, a modular Python library offering feature detection, fidelity metrics, structural preservation scores, and extensive visualization tools, tested on real-world use cases.

Result: SDB effectively handled diverse use cases such as healthcare diagnostics, socioeconomic modeling, and cybersecurity, showcasing its robustness and domain-agnostic application.

Conclusion: SDB provides a consistent and reproducible framework for synthetic data evaluation across various domains and challenges.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDFA-Net, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in Lithium-ion batteries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling techniques are inefficient at assessing local and global correlations in battery degradation sequences, posing challenges for real-life applications.

Method: MDFA-Net is composed of dual-path networks: MF-Net for shallow information retention, and EC-Net for capturing deep sequence trends, integrating local and global patterns.

Result: Testing on two public Lithium-ion battery datasets shows MDFA-Net exceeds top-tier methods in accurately forecasting capacity degradation.

Conclusion: MDFA-Net effectively predicts RUL by leveraging deep and shallow features, offering superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

### [151] [Per-Axis Weight Deltas for Frequent Model Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19720)
*Stefan Kuyumdzhiev,Radostin Cholakov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compact and efficient method to store fine-tuned language model weights by using a 1-bit delta compression scheme with lightweight per-axis scaling factors, improving cold-start latency and storage efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of serving many fine-tuned variants of large language models, which is constrained by the size of checkpoints and cold-start latency issues.

Method: A 1-bit delta scheme is proposed, representing weight differences with the sign of changes and per-axis FP16 scaling factors, learned from calibration data. This avoids dense reconstruction and optimizes data storage.

Result: The scheme effectively reduces storage overhead and cold-start latency, preserving inference efficiency and improving reconstruction quality compared to scalar alternatives.

Conclusion: The method is simple, drop-in efficient, and applicable without dense data reconstruction, making it practical for frequent model updates while enhancing system performance.

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction. Our experimental setup and source code are available at https://github.com/kuiumdjiev/Per-Axis-Weight-Deltas-for-Frequent-Model-Updates.

*Vineet Yadav*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced mathematical framework for comparing signals (real or complex-valued) using overlap-based distances. Its key innovation is incorporating sign and magnitude considerations while retaining important mathematical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend traditional overlap-based distance measures (like Jaccard/Tanimoto) beyond nonnegative inputs to real- and complex-valued signals, enabling better analytical tools for various scientific and financial domains.

Method: The method involves embedding signals into multistate representations based on their properties (e.g., positive/negative splits, Cartesian/polar). These embeddings are used to define new similarity measures that maintain bounded metric qualities, kernel compatibility, and interpretability.

Result: The framework produces distances that satisfy triangle inequality, define positive-semidefinite kernels, and can handle decompositions for both probabilistic analysis and magnitudes.

Conclusion: This innovative framework offers a cohesive way to analyze signals, ensuring bounded distance metrics, probabilistic interpretations, and modular analysis, making it applicable for feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other domains.

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Motivation: To address the challenge of incorporating cost function asymmetry within forecasting to minimize expenses and adapt to station-specific and unmodeled factors.

Method: A methodology that integrates cost asymmetry into forecasting distribution, uses dynamic adjustments to favor cost-effective outcomes, and employs a self-regulation mechanism based on observed savings.

Result: Empirical results indicate that this approach yields $5.1M annual savings.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively adapts to specific conditions and reduces costs by integrating cost asymmetry into forecasting outcomes.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recent advancements in machine learning have improved model capabilities significantly, but evolving real-world scenarios pose challenges necessitating continual learning and out-of-distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios introduce new conditions and unexpected inputs that traditional machine learning models, developed under i.i.d assumptions, struggle to manage effectively.

Method: The paper suggests addressing these limitations through the integration of Continual Learning (CL) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.

Result: By adopting CL and OOD detection, machine learning systems can adapt to evolving data streams while retaining previously learned knowledge and identifying novel inputs.

Conclusion: Combining CL and OOD detection is integral to building adaptive, robust, and efficient AI systems for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

*Carlos Purves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a split-policy architecture for RL deployment on resource-constrained edge devices to reduce data transfer, lower decision latency, and simplify server-side computation while maintaining comparable learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges faced in deploying visual policies on edge devices caused by computational limitations and communication latency.

Method: A split-policy architecture is proposed, where an on-device encoder transforms observations into compact feature tensors for remote policy evaluation, leveraging OpenGL fragment-shader passes for compatibility with embedded GPUs.

Result: The approach reduces communication overhead and server-side computational demands, achieves comparable performance in benchmarks, and demonstrates improved latency and scalability under bandwidth constraints.

Conclusion: This paper highlights the feasibility of an efficient RL deployment strategy for edge devices with trade-offs in performance, and provides open source code for replication and further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

*Peng-Hung Tsai,Daniel Berleant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on forecasting spacecraft lifetimes by merging machine learning and classical growth models, while addressing biases in lifetime analysis with the STETI approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving the accuracy of technology forecasting for spacecraft lifetimes, addressing the challenges caused by the complex interplay of technical, economic, and policy factors, as well as mitigating biases caused by traditional methods.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic literature review to identify trends in forecasting and developed a hybrid model that integrates LSTM neural networks with Moore's law. They introduced the STETI approach to address right censoring issues in lifetime analyses.

Result: The model successfully improved prediction of spacecraft lifetimes by mitigating biases due to censored data, offering a robust analysis framework for assessing lifetimes based on launch and failure times.

Conclusion: By integrating machine learning and addressing right censoring with STETI, this paper advances forecasting techniques, providing valuable insights for mission planning and policy-making in space exploration.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

*Daniel M. Jimenez-Gutierrez,Mehrdad Hassanzadeh,Aris Anagnostopoulos,Ioannis Chatzigiannakis,Andrea Vitaletti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Clust-PSI-PFL, a personalized federated learning (FL) framework that addresses challenges arising from non-IID data using PSI-based clustering. It achieves significant improvements in accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of biased updates and degraded performance in federated learning caused by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients.

Method: A novel clustering-based FL framework, Clust-PSI-PFL, which quantifies non-IID data using a weighted Population Stability Index (WPSI) metric, combining it with K-means++ clustering to form distributionally homogeneous client groups.

Result: Clust-PSI-PFL improves global accuracy by up to 18% and achieves a 37% improvement in client fairness compared to baselines under severe non-IID conditions across multiple datasets and protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed PSI-guided clustering represents an efficient and effective approach to personalized federated learning, particularly under label-skewed, non-IID data conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

*Haocheng Lu,Minjun Zhu,Henry Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors introduce a cost-efficient post-training pipeline to address structured errors in large language models during mathematical reasoning, emphasizing targeted improvements using a compact MathVerifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of large language models in mathematical reasoning and structured failures in chain-of-thought processes without relying on resource-intensive methods like RLHF.

Method: Employ supervised fine-tuning on MetaMathQA data combined with a MathVerifier that provides a six-dimensional error profile, interpretable scores, and guides a verifier-weighted Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a smaller-scale model demonstrates improved reasoning performance in logically inconsistent, near-correct scenarios, surpassing traditional fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight verifier-guided approach offers an effective alternative to traditional RLHF pipelines, delivering focused mathematical reasoning improvement under realistic computational constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

*Rui Pan,Zhuofu Chen,Ravi Netravali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a speculative decoding framework called FailFast that uses Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) to enhance token generation speed for autoregressive models, achieving substantial acceleration without compromising output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the efficiency-quality tradeoff in token generation when using dLLMs standalone, and explore their value as drafters to optimize speculative decoding for autoregressive verifiers.

Method: The FailFast framework dynamically adapts drafting lengths of dLLMs in speculative decoding. By minimizing computation in challenging portions and extending drafts in simpler areas, it reduces both speculation and verification times without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: FailFast achieves significant speedups, delivering up to 4.9× faster performance compared to vanilla decoding, 1.7× faster than the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4× faster than EAGLE-3, across different workloads and model types.

Conclusion: FailFast successfully resolves the efficiency-quality tradeoff in dLLMs by leveraging their parallel decoding capabilities for speculative decoding, effectively accelerating autoregressive models and offering practical value without fine-tuning adjustments.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

*Kosuke Ukita,Tsuyoshi Okita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowFM, a method that uses flow matching for efficient and effective self-supervised learning, demonstrating improvements in speed and performance over diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the trade-offs and computational inefficiencies of diffusion-based models for self-supervised learning, especially for wearable sensor data.

Method: FlowFM employs a joint training mechanism for a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator, optimizing velocity fields for faster and stabilized learning.

Result: Experiments show a 50.4% reduction in training time compared to diffusion-based methods, along with improvements in task performance and inference speedup (up to 51.0x).

Conclusion: FlowFM effectively balances generative and discriminative tasks, outperforming prior methods in both training efficiency and downstream task performance while maintaining high generative quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes methods for improving reasoning in large language models using sampling schemes, with PPS being the most effective approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing reasoning challenges in large language models by designing effective methods for rationale generation.

Method: The research formalized reasoning as a latent variable model with an expectation-maximization objective. It tested several sampling schemes: rejection sampling, STaR, and PPS.

Result: Experiments on datasets such as ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA showed that PPS outperforms rejection sampling and STaR in improving reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: Effective rationale generation methods, such as PPS, significantly influence reasoning accuracy in large language models, with PPS being the superior approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArcGen, a black-box method for detecting backdoor attacks on deep learning models by extracting architecture-invariant features, addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the poor generalization of current neural backdoor detection methods across unseen model architectures, which severely limits their effectiveness.

Method: The ArcGen method introduces an alignment layer in the feature extraction process to generate architecture-invariant features and employs two alignment losses to ensure these features align across different architectures while reflecting similar backdoor behaviors.

Result: ArcGen achieves up to 42.5% improvement in detection performance (e.g., AUC scores) across unseen architectures, validated on 16,896 models using diverse datasets, architectures, and attacks.

Conclusion: ArcGen significantly advances neural backdoor detection by ensuring model architecture generalization, offering a robust and improved detection approach.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the trade-off between deep networks' accuracy and shallow networks' hardware efficiency for embedded intelligent systems.

Method: Double-Win NAS employs a deep-to-shallow network transformation approach, integrating hybrid transformable training and arbitrary-resolution elastic training techniques.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrated that Double-Win NAS outperforms previous NAS methods on NVIDIA embedded systems with ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: Double-Win NAS achieves a balance between accuracy and hardware efficiency, proving effective for resource-constrained intelligent systems.

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes and refines the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset to control descriptor leakage and assesses predictive models using structured physical descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential descriptor leakage in bandgap prediction datasets and provide a refined dataset for accurate modeling and analysis.

Method: A systematic dataset refinement was applied to remove descriptors inadvertently encoding band-structure information, followed by a multi-phase modeling approach using tree-based models.

Result: Tree-based models achieved stable R2 values (~0.88-0.90) with controlled leakage and highlighted dielectric tensor components as dominant predictors.

Conclusion: The study establishes a leakage-controlled dataset and modeling benchmarks for future bandgap prediction research.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an unsupervised method for extracting meaningful and interpretable concepts from neural networks, addressing the limitations of sparse autoencoders.

Method: Clustering differences in activations combined with weighting by the skewness of activations, grounded in a discriminant analysis framework.

Result: The proposed method surpasses prior SAE variants in concept quality and approaches supervised baselines, with extracted concepts showing causal influence on downstream model behavior.

Conclusion: The clustering-based approach is a promising unsupervised method for interpretable concept extraction, applicable across different modalities and models.

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel prompting framework, CAse Prompting (CAP), which reduces demographic biases in ICU mortality prediction while improving performance, using a training-free, clinically adaptive approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address demographic biases in ICU mortality prediction made by LLMs, which hamper their trustworthy application despite their potential utility.

Method: The authors propose a multi-dimensional bias analysis scheme and introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), which uses a clinically adaptive, training-free prompting method based on debiasing and case-based reasoning.

Result: Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP increases AUROC and AUPRC significantly while reducing demographic disparities by over 90%. Consistent attention patterns are observed across demographic groups with similarity scores exceeding 0.98.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates that LLMs face bias in ICU mortality prediction, but these biases can be effectively mitigated using the CAP framework, achieving simultaneous fairness and accuracy without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoPHo, a method for conditional topology generation using classifier-guided diffusion and persistent homology, improving synthesis for graphs with desired properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic generation of topology graphs is essential due to limited real-world data availability, especially to test or release graphs with desired structural properties.

Method: By incorporating classifier gradients into the reverse diffusion posterior, CoPHo uses persistent homology features as conditional guidance for generating graphs with specific properties during every denoising step.

Result: Experiments show CoPHo surpasses previous methods in matching target metrics on various datasets, with further validation of transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

Conclusion: CoPHo enables more accurate and transferable topology generation, addressing fundamental barriers in conditional graph synthesis and outperforming current approaches.

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the robustness and efficiency of train delay predictions by addressing the issue of covariate shift during sequential forecasting in railway systems.

Method: The authors propose DCIL, a self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger with a distance-based drift correction to account for stochastic state transitions and uncertainty in delay propagation.

Result: DCIL outperforms traditional regression models and deep learning-based behavioral cloning in forecasting train delays, validated on a dataset containing over three million train movements.

Conclusion: DCIL effectively models delay propagation in railway systems, offering robust and uncertainty-aware predictions, thus contributing to more reliable railway operations.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient forecasting at delivery stations is vital for managing last-mile logistics, preventing resource misallocation, cost hikes, and delivery delays.

Method: OpComm employs LightGBM for demand forecasting, PPO for buffer control, and generative AI for interpretable outputs. It emphasizes penalizing under-buffering and uses Monte Carlo updates for adaptability.

Result: The framework lowered WAPE by 21.65%, reduced under-buffering incidents, and enhanced transparency across 400+ stations.

Conclusion: OpComm showcases how combining reinforcement learning with predictive modeling can tackle forecasting challenges in logistics, blending statistical accuracy with actionable insights.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers.

### [171] [OASI: Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization in TinyML Keyword Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19739)
*Soumen Garai,Suman Samui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), improving initialization for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) in resource-constrained Keyword Spotting (KWS) models for TinyML devices, achieving better accuracy and model size trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current naive initialization methods for MOBO, especially in achieving high accuracy and efficient model size balance for KWS on resource-limited TinyML devices.

Method: The authors propose OASI, leveraging Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a Pareto-efficient seed set. This method explicitly focuses on balancing accuracy and model size during initialization.

Result: OASI achieves the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and lowest generational distance (0.0) in TinyML KWS tasks, outperforming traditional initialization methods like LHS, Sobol, and Random search, with a slightly higher computation time.

Conclusion: OASI is a superior initialization method for MOBO in KWS applications, offering better trade-offs between accuracy and resource use with consistent performance and robustness.

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology to optimize Vision Transformers (ViTs) for edge deployment by combining pruning, mixed-precision execution, and quantization to reduce memory and latency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome memory, compute, and latency constraints of deploying large-scale transformer models on resource-limited edge devices.

Method: The approach involves a multi-stage optimization pipeline using activation profiling, structured pruning, selective FP16 conversion, and activation-aware INT8 quantization without retraining.

Result: The optimized ViT model achieves a 76% reduction in memory usage, over 6x lower latency, and maintains or improves accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to the original model.

Conclusion: This framework presents an effective solution for deploying ViTs on edge devices, with potential for future advancements by incorporating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts architectures.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CUDA-APML, a GPU-optimized implementation of APML for 3D point cloud modeling, achieving reduced memory usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in common loss functions for 3D point cloud modeling, notably balancing geometric fidelity with computational cost.

Method: Developed a sparse GPU implementation of APML that reduces memory requirements by employing adaptive softmax, symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization in coordinate form.

Result: CUDA-APML significantly reduces peak GPU memory usage by 99.9% and matches dense APML's accuracy on benchmarks like ShapeNet and MM-Fi.

Conclusion: CUDA-APML represents an efficient yet accurate advancement in 3D point cloud loss functions, combining high geometric fidelity with minimal memory requirements.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

### [176] [Brain-Grounded Axes for Reading and Steering LLM States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19399)
*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using human brain activity as a coordinate system, this study introduces interpretable and controllable axes to understand and steer LLM behavior at various layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised textual interpretability methods for LLMs lack grounding in external, meaningful systems.

Method: Brain activity (MEG dataset) is employed to develop interpretable axes via ICA validated with external lexica and labels. Lightweight adapters map LLM states to these brain-derived axes without fine-tuning the LLM, enabling steering and probing.

Result: Key axes such as log-frequency and function/content were identified and tested across multiple LLMs, with robust and interpretable results improving LLM steering and interpretability.

Conclusion: Brain-axis derived directions provide a promising neurophysiology-grounded interface for LLM interpretability and control.

Abstract: Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.

### [178] [How Many Experts Are Enough? Towards Optimal Semantic Specialization for Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19765)
*Sumin Park,Noseong Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASS, a semantic-aware MoE framework focusing on adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing for enhanced performance and semantic specialization in sparse mixture-of-experts systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SMoE frameworks are either overly dependent on hyperparameter tuning or fail to address semantic differentiation among experts when adjusting expert pool sizes.

Method: MASS uses a semantic drift detector for expert expansion and adaptive routing strategy for dynamic token-level expert utilization.

Result: MASS achieves optimized cost-performance trade-off with improved semantic specialization in synthetic setups and outperforms other baselines across language and vision datasets.

Conclusion: MASS demonstrates robustness and superior semantic specialization, overcoming limitations of existing SMoE frameworks through adaptive and targeted strategies.

Abstract: Finding the optimal configuration of Sparse Mixture-ofExperts (SMoE) that maximizes semantic differentiation among experts is essential for exploiting the full potential of MoE architectures. However, existing SMoE frameworks either heavily rely on hyperparameter tuning or overlook the importance of diversifying semantic roles across experts when adapting the expert pool size. We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) framework using graph attention networks for designing transit route networks, achieving significantly better results than human-designed systems and heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing transit route networks is a crucial, yet highly complex (NP-hard) problem, traditionally solved through manual planning. This calls for a more efficient, automated approach.

Method: An RL framework is introduced using graph attention networks. A two-level reward system is utilized, combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards.

Result: The proposed approach significantly outperforms both existing human-designed transit networks and traditional heuristics using a dataset from Bloomington, Indiana. It demonstrates improved service rates, shorter wait times, better bus utilization, higher route efficiency, and lower travel times.

Conclusion: The study proves that end-to-end reinforcement learning can effectively design transit route networks, exceeding the performance of traditional methods on realistic and city-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Motivation: To ensure reproducibility and scientific integrity in machine learning by understanding and addressing the conditions affecting consistent results in popular clustering algorithms.

Method: Decomposed the clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, and Ward) into fundamental steps, and tested reproducibility using Python's scikit-learn, with attention to influencing factors like OpenMP threads.

Result: Observed inconsistent results, particularly in K-Means, when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two, highlighting a critical reproducibility issue.

Conclusion: The study raises awareness about reproducibility challenges, prompting both users and developers to investigate further and address these issues for improved reliability.

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces randPROM, a neural Galerkin-projections-based approach for modeling spatiotemporal processes like tsunamis, enabling faster and generalized simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed-feature ROMs, which cannot account for varied initial conditions in spatiotemporal simulations, especially for complex problems like tsunamis.

Method: A novel Reduced Order Model (randPROM) using neural Galerkin projections and hierarchical pooling is introduced to calibrate weights flexibly and simulate generalized, physically consistent trajectories.

Result: randPROM reduces the need for extensive simulations and accurately predicts tsunami wave height and arrival times, demonstrated for synthetic cases and the 2011 Tohoku disaster.

Conclusion: randPROM offers an efficient, statistically robust method for simulating and predicting complex, chaotic phenomena like tsunamis, while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting strategies while maintaining alignment with business KPIs and constraints.

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a unified method merging in-context learning into the fine-tuning process to improve predictive performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to maximize the predictive effectiveness of downstream tasks by addressing the limitations of both prompt-based methods (challenging to scale data) and fine-tuning (underperforming with low data).

Method: A unified approach is proposed, incorporating in-context examples into the fine-tuning process to blend sample efficiency with performance gains. Prequential evaluation is used for hyperparameter selection in low-data settings.

Result: The proposed method achieves performance that consistently matches or exceeds prompt engineering and fine-tuning alone across various tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating in-context examples in fine-tuning combines strengths of both paradigms, offering robust performance across different data settings while economizing hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

### [184] [Demystifying LLM-as-a-Judge: Analytically Tractable Model for Inference-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19905)
*Indranil Halder,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores inference-time scaling in language models using a Bayesian framework, focusing on generalization error under specific scenarios of sample selection using softmax-weighted inference. They describe how scaling inference-time computation can outperform additional data collection under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and theorize the principles of inference-time scaling in large language models, which reallocates resources from training to inference, particularly under generalization error and task difficulty scenarios.

Method: The authors use a Bayesian linear regression model with high-dimensional analysis, deriving closed-form solutions for generalization error when inference-time sampling with softmax-weighted rewards based on a teacher model.

Result: Generalization error decreases monotonically with increased sampling if rewards are aligned with the teacher model. However, for mismatched rewards, excessive sampling can increase error. They also identify optimal sampling parameters and theoretically derive scaling laws under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Inference-time scaling is efficient in reducing error for aligned rewards but its advantage diminishes with higher task difficulty or reward misspecification. Best-of-$k$ scaling achieves an error decay of $Θ(1/k^2)$, emphasizing the trade-off between computation and new data collection.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

*Maxime Lacour,Pu Ren,Rie Nakata,Nori Nakata,Michael Mahoney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep-learning approach, CGM-FAS, for modeling non-ergodic path effects in seismic data, offering advantages over traditional Gaussian Process methods such as speed, flexibility, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational inefficiencies and limitations of Gaussian Process-based methods for large-scale non-ergodic ground-motion models, while improving spatial and interfrequency correlation modeling.

Method: A Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) approach was proposed, which uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to learn correlations and spatial patterns from earthquake data based on geographical coordinates.

Result: CGM-FAS was tested using San Francisco earthquake data and was shown to predict non-ergodic path effects consistently with GP-based models, while improving speed and efficiency, generating maps across thousands of sites and frequencies in seconds.

Conclusion: The study presents CGM-FAS as a viable and efficient alternative for non-ergodic ground-motion predictions, enabling rapid and scalable seismic hazard analysis without relying on prescribed correlation functions.

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

### [186] [Mitigating LLM Hallucination via Behaviorally Calibrated Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19920)
*Jiayun Wu,Jiashuo Liu,Zhiyuan Zeng,Tianyang Zhan,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by focusing on behavioral calibration, enabling models to admit uncertainty and improve their capacity to flag mistakes or abstain from responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs, which hinder deployment in critical domains like factual reasoning. Standard training and reinforcement paradigms incentivize models to prioritize guessing over epistemic honesty.

Method: The paper introduces training interventions using strictly proper scoring rules to align model outputs with accurate uncertainty quantification. It enables models to either abstain entirely or flag parts of responses where uncertainty exists.

Result: Using behavioral calibration techniques, their smaller model Qwen3-4B-Instruct surpasses frontier models in uncertainty quantification metrics such as cross-domain calibration error and log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Behavioral calibration enhances LLMs' ability to manage epistemic uncertainty, making smaller models outperform larger ones in specific meta-skills like uncertainty quantification, despite lower overall factual accuracy.

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Common Task Framework (CTF) for machine learning applications in seismology, providing benchmarks for seismic wavefield analysis to improve rigor and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismology faces challenges in forecasting, reconstructing, and managing parametric variability due to model inadequacies, sparse field data, and the computational burdens of simulations.

Method: The authors propose a Common Task Framework using curated seismic datasets at varying scales and task-specific metrics to enable standardized evaluations of machine learning models.

Result: Results demonstrate the CTF's ability to highlight performance strengths and limitations of ML models, showcasing its utility for rigorous comparisons and evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework aims to replace inconsistent comparisons with standardized evaluations, enhancing the scientific rigor and reproducibility of ML approaches in seismology.

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

### [188] [Conditional Adversarial Fragility in Financial Machine Learning under Macroeconomic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19935)
*Samruddhi Baviskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how financial machine learning models’ adversarial robustness fluctuates with economic regimes, showing heightened vulnerability during stress periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how adversarial robustness in financial machine learning systems is affected under dynamic economic conditions, particularly during stress periods.

Method: Introduces a regime-aware framework for evaluating adversarial robustness in financial models by segmenting regimes based on economic stress (e.g., volatility). This method isolates stress and calm conditions to observe performance under adversarial attacks while keeping other variables constant.

Result: During economic stress regimes, models suffer worse degradation under adversarial attacks in areas like accuracy, decision thresholds, and risk-sensitive outcomes. This includes increased false negatives, which heighten risks.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness in financial ML models is regime-dependent, necessitating stress-aware evaluation frameworks and governance layers for high-stake applications to minimize risks during adverse economic periods.

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving privacy-preserving machine learning while maintaining classification accuracy and reducing memory consumption.

Method: The paper utilizes Bloom filter transform to encode data into small, privacy-preserving bit arrays and assesses its effectiveness on six diverse datasets using four classifiers (XGBoost, DNN, CNN, Logistic Regression).

Result: Results show that models trained on Bloom-filter-encoded data achieve accuracy comparable to those trained on raw data, with added benefits of memory savings and privacy improvement.

Conclusion: The Bloom filter transform is effective as a preprocessing method for machine learning tasks, offering high accuracy along with better memory usage and privacy.

Abstract: We present a method that uses the Bloom filter transform to preprocess data for machine learning. Each sample is encoded into a compact, privacy-preserving bit array. This reduces memory use and protects the original data while keeping enough structure for accurate classification. We test the method on six datasets: SMS Spam Collection, ECG200, Adult 50K, CDC Diabetes, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST. Four classifiers are used: Extreme Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression. Results show that models trained on Bloom filter encodings achieve accuracy similar to models trained on raw data or other transforms. At the same time, the method provides memory savings while enhancing privacy. These results suggest that the Bloom filter transform is an efficient preprocessing approach for diverse machine learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoFT-LLM is a new method for time-series forecasting utilizing frequency-aware techniques and semantic calibration to improve performance under challenging conditions like limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasting often suffers from issues like insufficient data, noisy temporal dynamics, and underutilized auxiliary domain-specific variables, particularly in few-shot scenarios.

Method: The pipeline includes three components: a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting module to capture trends, a residual learner for high-frequency variations, and a fine-tuned LLM to integrate domain knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show that LoFT-LLM surpasses existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across financial and energy datasets.

Conclusion: LoFT-LLM offers a superior solution to forecasting challenges by combining spectral analysis and language model integration tailored for domain-specific contexts.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

*Khaled Kahouli,Romuald Elie,Klaus-Robert Müller,Quentin Berthet,Oliver T. Unke,Arnaud Doucet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI) to minimize score estimate variance in diffusion models, improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the variance trade-off in score estimation for diffusion models, as DSI and TSI suffer from high variance in low and high noise regimes respectively.

Method: CVSI unifies DSI and TSI using a control variate framework, deriving optimal time-dependent control coefficients to minimize variance across noise levels.

Result: CVSI significantly reduces variance, improving sample efficiency in data-free sampler learning and diffusion sampling during inference.

Conclusion: The proposed CVSI method provides a robust, low-variance score estimation framework, reconciling existing methods and enhancing diffusion model performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new activation function (OGAB) to address class imbalance in deep learning classifiers by using orthogonality and group-aware bias for enhanced feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning struggles with class imbalance in datasets, often leading to poor classifier performance, necessitating innovative methods to address this issue.

Method: The proposed OGAB activation function leverages orthogonal transformations to preserve minority class information and introduces group-aware bias mechanisms for automatic class separability without explicit supervision.

Result: Experiments on real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets confirm that OGAB consistently improves classification performance over existing activation functions.

Conclusion: OGAB effectively mitigates class imbalance during the training phase by enhancing embeddings and can be seamlessly integrated into deep learning workflows.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

*Yuan Gao,Zhenguo Dong,Xuelong Wang,Zhiqiang Wang,Yong Zhang,Shaofan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DecoKAN, an interpretable framework for forecasting cryptocurrency prices by decoupling long-term and high-frequency dynamics using wavelet decomposition and symbolic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for cryptocurrency forecasting are often 'black-box' and lack both interpretability and the ability to disentangle complex socio-economic trends from high-frequency oscillations.

Method: The proposed DecoKAN framework uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for time series decomposition and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for nonlinear modeling. Additionally, it applies symbolic analysis for interpretability.

Result: DecoKAN achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error across real-world datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DecoKAN bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering an advanced tool for trustworthy financial decision-making in cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable forecasting of multivariate time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets in digital asset systems. Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets.

### [195] [An Optimal Policy for Learning Controllable Dynamics by Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20053)
*Peter N. Loxley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a policy for effectively learning controllable dynamic environments through exploration, addressing certain challenging state types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable agents to effectively learn and adapt in unknown environments by optimizing exploration strategies in controllable Markov chains.

Method: The paper provides a parameterized control set, devises an algorithm for finding an optimal non-stationary policy to maximize information gain, and explores unique state restrictions.

Result: The policy demonstrates effectiveness in optimizing exploration behavior, supported by theoretical validation using counting arguments and comparisons with suboptimal methods.

Conclusion: A non-stationary policy is necessary for optimal exploration in dynamic environments, and the proposed framework provides theoretical and practical advancements for learning controllable dynamics.

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents PairFlow, a lightweight preprocessing step for accelerative training in Discrete Flow Models (DFMs), enabling faster sampling without relying on a pretrained teacher.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFMs are powerful generative models for discrete data but suffer from slow sampling. Previous acceleration methods rely on finetuning, adding training overhead.

Method: PairFlow uses closed-form inversion of DFMs to efficiently construct paired samples from source and target distributions, eliminating the need for a pretrained teacher.

Result: Despite minimal computational overhead (up to 1.7% of full training), PairFlow achieves or surpasses the performance of finetuning-based methods. It also provides stronger base models for distillation.

Conclusion: PairFlow is a cost-efficient framework that accelerates DFMs, has broad applicability across different data types, and enhances future model distillation and finetuning results.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces QE-Catalytic, a framework combining a language model with a graph neural network for predicting adsorption energy and inverse design in catalysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in text-based approaches and improve adsorption energy prediction accuracy for catalysis using multimodal modeling.

Method: The authors integrate E(3)-equivariant graph neural network Equiformer-V2 with a large language model (Qwen), enabling joint 3D structure-text prediction and autoregressive design.

Result: QE-Catalytic improves relaxed adsorption energy prediction accuracy (MAE reduced to 0.486 eV on OC20) and outperforms baseline models.

Conclusion: QE-Catalytic offers enhanced accuracy for catalyst screening and design by integrating multimodal approaches leveraging graph structures and textual descriptions.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

*Jeehong Kim,Youngseok Hwang,Minchan Kim,Sungho Bae,Hyunwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in maritime domains, focusing on spatio-temporal graph neural networks in non-grid environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of fixed reference points and structured data in real-world systems like maritime traffic, making anomaly detection and graph construction fundamentally challenging.

Method: The researchers extend the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) as a benchmark tailored for node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomaly detection, utilizing LLM-based agents to synthesize trajectories and inject anomalies.

Result: The dataset enables systematic anomaly evaluation across multiple granularities, allowing researchers to create richer contexts for analysis.

Conclusion: This work aims to improve reproducibility and inspire advancements in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new paradigm using Jensen-Shannon Divergence for representation learning on rich-text graphs, proposing two new graph neural networks: DMPGCN and DMPPRG, which outperform state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the issue of contextual and structural divergence in representation learning within rich-text graphs, which existing methods inadequately handle.

Method: The paper proposes the Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP) paradigm, which captures both similarities and dissimilarities in structure and text to compute new message weights. Two novel graph neural networks, DMPGCN and DMPPRG, are introduced to implement this.

Result: DMPGCN and DMPPRG were evaluated on several rich-text datasets and consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed JSDMP paradigm and its implementation through DMPGCN and DMPPRG effectively address contextual and structural divergence, offering superior performance for representation learning in rich-text graphs.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the widely existing contextual and structural divergence may influence the representation learning in rich-text graphs. To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that DMPGCN and DMPPRG can outperform other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing paradigm

*Annika Hirling,Giorgio Nicoletti,Antonio Celani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Multi-Armed Bandit problem using Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, comparing them to optimal strategies in Bernoulli bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze efficient methods for balancing exploration and exploitation in sequential decision-making environments and to synthesize reinforcement learning concepts with information theory.

Method: The authors adapt the IDS framework to a discounted infinite-horizon setting using a modified information measure and a tuning parameter. They then rigorously evaluate this framework in two specific Bernoulli bandit scenarios.

Result: In symmetric bandits, IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret; while in one-fair-coin scenarios, IDS regrets logarithmically, aligning with classical lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into IDS policies, effectively bridging reinforcement learning and information theory concepts in the evaluation of bandit problems.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

### [201] [Sample-Efficient Policy Constraint Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning based on Sample Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20115)
*Yuanhao Chen,Qi Liu,Pengbin Chen,Zhongjian Qiao,Yanjie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in offline RL caused by suboptimal transitions in datasets and proposes a filtering method to improve training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the distribution shift problem in offline RL and overcome inefficiencies caused by low-reward transitions in datasets.

Method: A sample filtering method is introduced that evaluates transition scores and selectively trains RL algorithms using high-score transitions.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in multiple offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: Selective filtering of high-score transitions improves sample efficiency and final performance in offline RL frameworks.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents NeuralCrop, a hybrid crop model combining process-based and machine learning approaches to improve crop yield simulations and projections under climate change and extreme weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs), which suffer from uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes and challenges in generalization faced by standalone machine learning methods.

Method: The authors developed NeuralCrop, a hybrid model that combines process-based GGCMs with machine learning. This model is trained to emulate a GGCM and fine-tuned using observational data.

Result: NeuralCrop outperforms traditional GGCMs in simulating interannual yield anomalies and performs robustly even under drought and unseen climatic conditions, surpassing pure machine learning approaches.

Conclusion: NeuralCrop offers a more reliable and accurate method for predicting crop yields, especially against the challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

TL;DR: Cost-TrustFL optimizes federated learning by improving robustness against attacks and reducing communication costs in multi-cloud environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical issues in federated learning across multi-cloud setups, such as high communication costs and malicious participant detection in non-IID data scenarios.

Method: Introduced hierarchical federated learning with Shapley value-based lightweight reputation evaluation and cost-aware aggregation to reduce complexity and communication costs.

Result: Cost-TrustFL achieved 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients and cut communication costs by 32%, demonstrating stability under variable attack and data conditions.

Conclusion: Cost-TrustFL is practical for real-world multi-cloud settings by balancing accuracy, cost, and robustness in federated learning systems.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

*Kausthubh Manda,Raghuram Bharadwaj Diddigi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies offline multitask reinforcement learning with settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions, proposing and analyzing a multitask fitted Q-iteration approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to exploit shared structures in offline multitask reinforcement learning to improve statistical efficiency and generalization by pooling data from related tasks.

Method: The proposed method involves a multitask extension of fitted Q-iteration, jointly learning shared representations and task-specific value functions using Bellman error minimization on fixed, offline datasets.

Result: The analysis shows that pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, achieving a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on sample size and favorable generalization guarantees, even under common distribution shift challenges.

Conclusion: Shared representations aid in multitask offline Q-learning by enhancing generalization and efficiency, and can also simplify downstream task learning.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

*Onintze Zaballa,Verónica Álvarez,Santiago Mazuelas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting to address dynamic changes and uncertainties in load demand for multiple entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for accurate load forecasting across multiple entities in power systems, crucial for efficiency and reliability, and addressing challenges like dynamic consumption patterns and inter-entity correlations.

Method: The authors introduced a vector-valued hidden Markov model with recursive parameter updates for adaptive multi-task learning and probabilistic forecasting of load demand.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in forecasting accuracy and uncertainty assessment, validated through experiments on datasets with diverse and dynamic load patterns.

Conclusion: The adaptive multi-task learning approach delivers better load forecasting and uncertainty quantification, addressing limitations of previous offline learning methods and adapting to dynamic changes.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

*Nathan Roos,Ekaterina Iakovleva,Ani Gjergji,Vito Paolo Pastore,Enzo Tartaglione*

TL;DR: The study investigates the influence of sampling algorithms and hyperparameters on bias amplification in diffusion-based generative models, showing they can both amplify and reduce biases regardless of the trained model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel at image synthesis but often replicate and amplify dataset biases, and their bias-related behavior during sampling remains poorly understood.

Method: The authors conducted empirical studies with diffusion models trained on biased datasets and examined the impact of hyperparameters in sampling algorithms.

Result: The findings highlight that sampling algorithms and their parameters significantly affect bias amplification, with hyperparameter tuning leading to either bias amplification or reduction.

Conclusion: Sampling algorithms and hyperparameter settings are critical factors in bias amplification in diffusion-based models, even for fixed trained models, pointing to the need for more nuanced control during sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability in decoding semantic information from brain activity signals for generating natural language descriptions.

Method: The authors propose the BrainROI model that utilizes a new fMRI encoder with soft-ROI parcellations and a voxel-gate mechanism. The model also includes interpretable prompt optimization using the Qwen model and parameterized constraints for stable decoding.

Result: The BrainROI model achieved superior results on the NSD dataset in brain-captioning, showing clear improvements in metrics like BLEU-4 and CIDEr under cross-subject settings when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations in BrainROI significantly enhance its decoding performance and cross-subject transferability while improving interpretability and stability in generated descriptions.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using neural operator learning to create fast and precise emulators for moving boundary flow systems, specifically applying it in Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enable real-time, accurate, and efficient monitoring and control of moving boundary systems by addressing limitations in traditional inverse modeling methods, particularly those applied in RTM processes.

Method: A Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) is used for surrogate modeling of Darcy flow dynamics, paired with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) framework to handle Bayesian inverse problems.

Result: The proposed framework accelerates computation by orders of magnitude compared to full-model EKI, offers real-time parameter estimation, and ensures adaptability across spatial and temporal domains while enhancing efficiency and accuracy in RTM processes.

Conclusion: The framework represents a major advancement in using neural operators for industrial applications, supporting the practical deployment of digital twins for moving boundary flow systems and other similar domains.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GAN approaches face difficulties in efficiently and accurately capturing continuous-time stochastic path dynamics, particularly due to computational costs and training instability of prior methods.

Method: HGAN-SDEs leverage Neural Hermite functions as a lightweight and expressive basis to model dynamics in GAN's discriminator, addressing previous issues in computational and training efficiency.

Result: The framework shows improved runtime efficiency, enhanced training stability, and superior sample quality in learning SDE-driven distributions compared to prior models on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: HGAN-SDEs provide an effective and theoretically grounded solution for generative modeling of stochastic processes, outperforming existing techniques in efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the CDSP-MoE framework, which resolves the limitations of current Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models by dynamically instantiating experts in a shared space through learnable topology masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome two main issues in current MoE designs: structural parameter isolation, leading to catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting, which degrades performance in instruction-free settings.

Method: The method involves leveraging the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis and using gradient conflict as a structural signal via a Lagged Gradient Game to prune conflicting pathways and create dynamic modular structures.

Result: CDSP-MoE demonstrates robust routing based on content without relying on explicit task labels. It maintains semantic specialization under blind inference protocols.

Conclusion: CDSP-MoE enhances MoE architecture efficiency and robustness by overcoming catastrophic forgetting and instruction-overfitting issues, proving effective even without explicit task instructions.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TableGPT-R1, a tabular data model leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning and code execution capabilities on structured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models often struggle with complex reasoning and code execution on tabular data due to limitations like data scarcity, feedback complexity, and risks of over-specialization.

Method: The methodology includes synthesized agentic trajectories, a reward system combining rule-based and criteria-injected strategies, and a multi-stage training framework for stabilization and specialization.

Result: TableGPT-R1 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, surpassing baseline models and maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: TableGPT-R1 marks a significant advancement in RL-based tabular data analysis, blending systematic training and model flexibility to address current challenges.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedDPC, a novel federated learning method that addresses data heterogeneity and partial client participation to enhance global model performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges from data heterogeneity and partial client participation, which impair global model convergence and training stability.

Method: FedDPC mitigates these issues by projecting local updates onto previous global updates to control variance and employing adaptive scaling for local updates before aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on heterogeneously partitioned image datasets show that FedDPC achieves faster training loss reduction and higher test accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedDPC effectively addresses data heterogeneity and partial client participation, improving both the performance and training efficiency of federated learning systems.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Result: Achieved models that outperform classical approaches and are 421 times faster than existing implementations.

Conclusion: The paradigm successfully blends physics insights with machine learning for efficient and precise detector simulations, setting a benchmark for ZDC applications.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuel consumption is a major cost factor in maritime operations and has significant environmental implications. Accurate prediction of shaft power is essential to optimize efficiencies and reduce emissions.

Method: A hybrid approach combining physics-based empirical formulas with neural networks was developed, leveraging the strengths of both methods.

Result: The proposed method outperformed baseline neural networks and traditional empirical methods in predicting vessel fuel consumption, achieving lower error metrics across all tested vessels.

Conclusion: Integrating physics-based knowledge with neural networks provides a more accurate and effective solution for optimizing maritime fuel consumption.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

TL;DR: The paper presents Field-Space attention, a novel mechanism for Earth system Transformers designed to preserve continuous geophysical field structures, enabling efficient and physically consistent Earth system modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth system dynamics require models that respect the geometric structure of continuous geophysical fields for accurate, interpretable, and physically consistent predictions.

Method: The paper introduces Field-Space attention, which operates in the physical domain rather than latent space, utilizing a fixed multiscale decomposition and structure-preserving transformations to integrate multiscale information.

Result: Field-Space Transformers achieve faster and more stable convergence with fewer parameters compared to Vision Transformers and U-Nets, providing improved fidelity and enabling embedding of scientific constraints.

Conclusion: Field-Space attention offers a compact, interpretable, and physically consistent modeling framework for future Earth system prediction and generative modeling.

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

TL;DR: GeoTransolver, a novel transformer-based model for Computational Aerodynamics Engineering (CAE), integrates multiscale geometry-aware physics attention and delivers improved accuracy and robustness in high-fidelity modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance computational models in CAE with improved accuracy, robustness to geometric and regime shifts, and better data efficiency by combining physics-aware attention and multiscale geometry-aware context.

Method: GeoTransolver introduces the GALE attention mechanism, blending physics-aware self-attention with cross-attention tied to multiscale geometry and boundary conditions, implemented within NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo.

Result: The model outperforms existing methods like Domino and Transolver in terms of accuracy (drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors), robustness to shifts, and data efficiency in benchmarking studies.

Conclusion: GeoTransolver represents a significant step forward in operator learning for surrogate modeling, particularly for complex geometries and nonlinear physical systems, due to its unification of geometry and physics-based attention.

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

### [217] [BRIDGE: Budget-aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation with Guided Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20403)
*Xuan-An Le,Minh-Nam Tran,Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes BRIDGE, a two-phase framework for distilling knowledge from large proprietary models to smaller ones (tiny deployable models) by addressing constraints like capacity gaps and budget limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of transferring knowledge from large proprietary models to smaller, deployable models efficiently while addressing issues of capacity gap and prohibitive API costs.

Method: The method involves a two-phase framework. Phase 1 uses a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA) to learn from the large teacher model on a limited dataset via a cost-efficient selection pipeline. In Phase 2, the TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset, which are then used to train a small student model with instruction-tuning to ensure behavioral alignment and reasoning.

Result: BRIDGE consistently delivers student model performance gains of 28-41%, reducing capability gaps with proprietary teacher models by 12-16% while consuming only 10% of teacher queries compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: BRIDGE surpasses direct distillation methods in cost-performance efficiency, delivering significant improvements in knowledge transfer while using only 5% of the resources typically required.

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

### [218] [Simplifying Multi-Task Architectures Through Task-Specific Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20420)
*Mihai Suteu,Ovidiu Serban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes using task-specific normalization layers in Multi-task Learning (MTL) instead of complex architectures, yielding competitive results while being simpler and more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and enhance Multi-task Learning (MTL) by avoiding intricate task-specific architectures while still addressing generalization challenges and resource allocation.

Method: The paper investigates replacing shared normalization with task-specific normalization variants and introduces Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN) to boost performance with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: The proposed TS$σ$BN improves stability and performance on datasets like NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, with better parameter efficiency and interpretable insights on MTL dynamics.

Conclusion: Task-specific normalization layers can efficiently handle Multi-task Learning, challenging the need for complex task-specific architectures by offering a lightweight, interpretable, and effective solution.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

*Jibin Joseph*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents methods to predict user frustration in e-commerce sessions using clickstream data. Utilizing tabular features with classifiers and LSTM-based models, frustration is detected early with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User frustration on mobile apps or websites can lead to lost sales and complaints, emphasizing the need to predict and mitigate these issues.

Method: Rules are applied to clickstream data to define frustration characteristics. Features are extracted from the session data, training both tabular classifiers (e.g., XGBoost) and LSTM models. Predictions are based on early session interactions.

Result: XGBoost achieves 90% accuracy with an ROC AUC of 0.9579, while LSTM achieves 91% accuracy with an ROC AUC of 0.9705, effectively and reliably predicting frustration early in sessions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully identifies frustrated sessions with high accuracy, providing tools for businesses to improve user experience and reduce lost sales through early intervention.

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational inefficiency of recurrent deep reinforcement learning models, enabling their adoption in state-of-the-art off-policy RL tasks.

Method: The method involves RISE, combining learnable and non-learnable encoder layers to integrate recurrent models into off-policy RL algorithms without added computational costs.

Result: When applied to leading non-recurrent algorithms, RISE improves human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance by 35.6% on the Atari benchmark.

Abstract: Recurrent off-policy deep reinforcement learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are often sidelined due to their high computational demands. In response, we introduce RISE (Recurrent Integration via Simplified Encodings), a novel approach that can leverage recurrent networks in any image-based off-policy RL setting without significant computational overheads via using both learnable and non-learnable encoder layers. When integrating RISE into leading non-recurrent off-policy RL algorithms, we observe a 35.6% human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance improvement across the Atari benchmark.

*Matthias Hertel,Sebastian Pütz,Ralf Mikut,Veit Hagenmeyer,Benjamin Schäfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHAPformer, a fast and accurate explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture, addressing limitations of SHAP in handling time-series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance explainability of time-series forecasts, addressing SHAP's inefficiencies and limitations in feature independence assumptions.

Method: SHAPformer is built on the Transformer architecture, using attention manipulation for generating fast and accurate explanations without sampling counterfactuals.

Result: SHAPformer delivers explanations in under one second, performs well on synthetic and real-world data, and identifies key features like past load and unique behaviors during specific periods.

Conclusion: SHAPformer improves both time-series forecast accuracy and explainability, offering rapid and meaningful insights to users while overcoming limitations of traditional SHAP models.

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

### [222] [Performative Policy Gradient: Optimality in Performative Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20576)
*Debabrota Basu,Udvas Das,Brahim Driss,Uddalak Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Performative Policy Gradient (PePG), a novel RL algorithm addressing performativity by achieving performatively optimal policies, unlike prior methods focusing solely on stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL approaches ignore the shift in underlying dynamics caused by the algorithm’s influence on the environment, hence the need to develop optimal solutions in performative settings.

Method: The authors derived performative RL counterparts of key lemmas and proposed PePG, a policy gradient algorithm, for optimizing policies in performative settings.

Result: PePG converges to policies that remain optimal under their induced distribution shifts and outperforms standard RL models and existing performative RL algorithms in experiments.

Conclusion: The study extends previous works by achieving performative optimality and demonstrates promise for further improving RL applications in shifting environments.

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

*Leslie Barrett,Michael W. Sherman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses improving the quality of hand-tagged training data for machine learning by proposing statistical methods to measure and enhance tagging consistency and agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of attention in literature towards quality control of hand-tagged training data, which significantly varies depending on the tagging exercise.

Method: The authors propose statistical approaches to evaluate tagging consistency and agreement, emphasize the importance of monitoring agreement metrics over multiple iterations, and suggest alternatives to multiple tags for every item to improve data quality.

Result: The study highlights that declining variance in agreement metrics over iterations is an indicator of better data quality. It also suggests that collecting high-quality data doesn't necessarily require multiple tags per item and questions the adequacy of tagger burn-in periods for reducing errors.

Conclusion: Using statistical evaluations and iterative monitoring can enhance training data quality without excessive redundancy. The methods proposed could streamline efficient quality control in tagged datasets.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

*Stephane Gaubert,Yiannis Vlassopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes interpreting ReLU neural network output as a zero-sum game, leveraging game theory to evaluate, train, and verify robustness properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a novel game-theoretic framework for understanding and analyzing ReLU neural networks and improve their interpretability and robustness.

Method: A game-theoretic representation using a zero-sum, turn-based stopping game (ReLU net game), inducing transition probabilities and using Shapley-Bellman recursion for network evaluation.

Result: The framework provides a path-integral formula, derives bounds on output using bounds on input, verifies robustness properties, and formulates network training as an inverse game problem.

Conclusion: This approach enriches the theoretical understanding of neural networks, enabling a new perspective on evaluating, training, and improving robustness properties.

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning method called 'internal RL,' leveraging internal representations in autoregressive models to overcome inefficiencies in sparse-reward scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning on autoregressive models often struggles with inefficiency when rewards are sparse, prompting the need for more effective exploration mechanisms.

Method: The authors introduce a non-causal higher-order sequence model that operates on the internal representations of an autoregressive model, enabling hierarchical actions with learned termination conditions.

Result: Experiments in grid world and MuJoCo tasks show improved exploration and learning efficiency compared to standard RL approaches, especially in sparse-reward cases.

Conclusion: Internal RL enables efficient learning in autoregressive models through latent action generation and deep hierarchical exploration, making it a promising strategy for sparse reward scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified theoretical framework explaining simplicity bias in neural networks, where solutions progressively increase in complexity during learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the widely observed phenomenon of simplicity bias in neural networks and provide a unifying explanation for it, across different architectures.

Method: The authors analyze gradient descent learning dynamics, focusing on invariant manifolds and saddle points across various types of neural networks to uncover how complexity evolves.

Result: Key results explain simplicity bias as saddle-to-saddle dynamics, showing how networks sequentially increase complexity: linear networks increase rank, ReLU networks add kinks, convolutional networks add kernels, and self-attention models add heads.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the progressive learning of complex solutions by gradient descent, influenced by factors like data distribution and weight initialization.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural architecture search method, DCL-ENAS, using dual contrastive learning to train a neural predictor, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency across benchmark and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and limited training data for high-precision predictors in Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS).

Method: Introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach for training neural predictors: (1) contrastive self-supervised learning for representation learning from architectures without labels, and (2) fine-tuning with contrastive learning to predict relative performance of architectures.

Result: DCL-ENAS achieved superior validation accuracy across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, improving baselines by 0.05% to 0.39%, and enhanced performance by 2.5% in a real-world ECG task with only 7.7 GPU-days.

Conclusion: DCL-ENAS effectively guides ENAS with reduced computational cost, achieving high accuracy and applicability to both benchmark datasets and real-world tasks.

Abstract: Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) has gained attention for automatically designing neural network architectures. Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days.

*Tarik Houichime,Abdelghani Souhar,Younes El Amrani*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a novel method for memory representation in Large Language Models, emphasizing trajectory persistence over item storage to significantly improve compression and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of memory representation in Large Language Models suffer from limitations such as memory overflow and latency due to linear accumulation of Key-Value states.

Method: The authors propose PTM, a neuro-symbolic approach, encoding context as a continuous trajectory governed by irrational rotation matrices and enabling memory decoupling into geometric navigation and probabilistic reconstruction.

Result: PTM achieves over 3,000 times compression compared to traditional dense caches and ensures up to 92% factual accuracy with faster memory access latency of approximately 34ms.

Conclusion: PTM redefines the concept of memory in language models by treating memory as a reconstructive process acting on conserved signals, enabling infinite context without the necessity of infinite physical resources.

Abstract: The memory of contemporary Large Language Models is bound by a physical paradox: as they learn, they fill up. The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via "Signal Consensus" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NABA, a unified white matter tractography atlas for neonates and adults, enabling direct cross-population comparison and analysis of brain development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding brain development and identifying potential biomarkers for neurological disorders require tools that allow comparison of white matter connections between neonates and adults.

Method: The authors propose NABA, a white matter atlas built from diffusion MRI data of neonates and adults, developed using a data-driven fiber clustering method to ensure joint white matter mapping across populations.

Result: NABA successfully identifies white matter tracts in neonates and adults, enabling analyses such as age and sex-related differences and the impact of preterm birth on brain development.

Conclusion: NABA provides a standardized framework to investigate white matter development, revealing key developmental insights and potential differences across populations.

Abstract: Comparing white matter (WM) connections between adults and neonates using diffusion MRI (dMRI) can advance our understanding of typical brain development and potential biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts. These findings demonstrate that NABA is a useful tool for investigating WM development across neonates and adults.

*Philipp Schröer,Darion Haase,Joost-Pieter Katoen*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach to diagnostics in deductive verification of probabilistic programs using slices for error reporting, proof simplification, and preserving verification results. It introduces the tool Brutus to implement these concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in deductive verification lack efficient tools to provide insightful error diagnostics for probabilistic programs. This paper aims to improve user diagnostics during this process by introducing slicing techniques.

Method: The authors define slicing concepts based on the HeyVL intermediate verification language and implement these concepts in a tool called Brutus. Slicing is applied for error reporting, proof simplification, and preserving successful results, using algorithms like binary search, unsatisfiable cores, and SMT encodings for optimization.

Result: The implementation of Brutus successfully identifies small, informative slices in probabilistic programs. The empirical evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness in providing specialized error messages and verification hints.

Conclusion: Slicing techniques, as implemented in Brutus, significantly improve diagnostics in probabilistic program verification. The method is versatile and can be adapted across various probabilistic programming languages.

Abstract: This paper focuses on effective user diagnostics generated during the deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Our key principle is based on providing slices for (1) error reporting, (2) proof simplification, and (3) preserving successful verification results. By formally defining these different notions on HeyVL, an existing quantitative intermediate verification language (IVL), our concepts (and implementation) can be used to obtain diagnostics for a range of probabilistic programming languages. Slicing for error reporting is a novel notion of error localization for quantitative assertions. We demonstrate slicing-based diagnostics on a variety of proof rules such as quantitative versions of the specification statement and invariant-based loop rules, and formally prove the correctness of specialized error messages and verification hints.
  We implemented our user diagnostics into the deductive verifier Caesar. Our novel implementation -- called \emph{Brutus} -- can search for slices which do or do not verify, corresponding to each of the three diagnostic notions. For error reporting (1), it exploits a binary search-based algorithm that minimizes error-witnessing slices. To solve for slices that verify (2 and 3), we empirically compare different algorithms based on unsatisfiable cores, minimal unsatisfiable subset enumeration, and a direct SMT encoding of the slicing problem. Our empirical evaluation of Brutus on existing and new benchmarks shows that we can find slices that are both small and informative.

### [231] [Gaussian Variational Inference with Non-Gaussian Factors for State Estimation: A UWB Localization Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19855)
*Andrew Stirling,Mykola Lukashchuk,Dmitry Bagaev,Wouter Kouw,James R. Forbes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper extends the ESGVI algorithm for state estimation to matrix Lie groups and introduces factors for heavy-tailed and skewed noise, validated with real-world experiments and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in state estimation with orientation components and to handle heavy-tailed, skewed noise distributions encountered in UWB localization.

Method: The authors generalize ESGVI to matrix Lie groups and integrate factors accommodating complex noise distributions while preserving algorithm efficiency.

Result: Improved accuracy and comparable consistency in localization were observed when tested on UWB data with challenging noise conditions.

Conclusion: The extensions enhance ESGVI's capabilities for practical applications, with open-source implementation provided for further use.

Abstract: This letter extends the exactly sparse Gaussian variational inference (ESGVI) algorithm for state estimation in two complementary directions. First, ESGVI is generalized to operate on matrix Lie groups, enabling the estimation of states with orientation components while respecting the underlying group structure. Second, factors are introduced to accommodate heavy-tailed and skewed noise distributions, as commonly encountered in ultra-wideband (UWB) localization due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects. Both extensions are shown to integrate naturally within the ESGVI framework while preserving its sparse and derivative-free structure. The proposed approach is validated in a UWB localization experiment with NLOS-rich measurements, demonstrating improved accuracy and comparable consistency. Finally, a Python implementation within a factor-graph-based estimation framework is made open-source (https://github.com/decargroup/gvi_ws) to support broader research use.

### [232] [A Time-efficient Prioritised Scheduling Algorithm to Optimise Initial Flock Formation of Drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19914)
*Sujan Warnakulasooriya,Andreas Willig,Xiaobing Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a prioritised scheduling algorithm to enhance the initial formation of drone flocks, solving collision issues efficiently for up to 5000 drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As drone applications expand, initial formation for cooperative flocking poses challenges due to collisions and inefficiencies in existing algorithms.

Method: The algorithm assigns priority to drones based on potential collisions and impact on others, calculating delays for collision-free paths.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated superior performance and efficiency, successfully managing up to 5000 drones and outperforming the CDH-PP method in simulations.

Conclusion: This prioritised scheduling algorithm significantly enhances the initial formation process in drone flocking, providing scalable and efficient collision-free solutions.

Abstract: Drone applications continue to expand across various domains, with flocking offering enhanced cooperative capabilities but introducing significant challenges during initial formation. Existing flocking algorithms often struggle with efficiency and scalability, particularly when potential collisions force drones into suboptimal trajectories. This paper presents a time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm that improves the initial formation process of drone flocks. The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.

### [233] [Bring My Cup! Personalizing Vision-Language-Action Models with Visual Attentive Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20014)
*Sangoh Lee,Sangwoo Mo,Wook-Shin Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a method to help Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models handle personalized commands for manipulating user-specific objects by leveraging a training-free perceptual adapter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models struggle to handle personalized commands involving specific objects unseen during training. This limitation hampers their ability to identify and manipulate personal items.

Method: The proposed VAP method uses reference images as non-parametric visual memory to ground the personal object in a scene. It highlights the object through open-vocabulary detection, embedding-based matching, and rewrites the instructions accordingly for personalization.

Result: VAP outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation across simulation and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: VAP effectively bridges the gap between semantic understanding and precise instance-level control for personalized object manipulation in robots.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models generalize well to generic instructions, they struggle with personalized commands such as "bring my cup", where the robot must act on one specific instance among visually similar objects. We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.

### [234] [LoLA: Long Horizon Latent Action Learning for General Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20166)
*Xiaofan Wang,Xingyu Gao,Jianlong Fu,Zuolei Li,Dean Fortier,Galen Mullins,Andrey Kolobov,Baining Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoLA, a framework for long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation that significantly improves performance over existing methods by integrating multi-view observations and grounding visual-linguistic inputs into actionable robot motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to leverage historical information and generate coherent action sequences necessary for long-horizon robotic tasks.

Method: LoLA incorporates Vision-Language Models for encoding historical sequences and multi-view data along with a State-Aware Latent Re-representation module that grounds robot actions using a learnable embodiment-anchored latent space.

Result: LoLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robotic tasks, especially in long-horizon manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: LoLA demonstrates the importance of integrating historical, multi-modal data and physical grounding in improving long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: The capability of performing long-horizon, language-guided robotic manipulation tasks critically relies on leveraging historical information and generating coherent action sequences. However, such capabilities are often overlooked by existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. To solve this challenge, we propose LoLA (Long Horizon Latent Action Learning), a framework designed for robot manipulation that integrates long-term multi-view observations and robot proprioception to enable multi-step reasoning and action generation. We first employ Vision-Language Models to encode rich contextual features from historical sequences and multi-view observations. We further introduces a key module, State-Aware Latent Re-representation, which transforms visual inputs and language commands into actionable robot motion space. Unlike existing VLA approaches that merely concatenate robot proprioception (e.g., joint angles) with VL embeddings, this module leverages such robot states to explicitly ground VL representations in physical scale through a learnable "embodiment-anchored" latent space. We trained LoLA on diverse robotic pre-training datasets and conducted extensive evaluations on simulation benchmarks (SIMPLER and LIBERO), as well as two real-world tasks on Franka and Bi-Manual Aloha robots. Results show that LoLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods (e.g., pi0), particularly in long-horizon manipulation tasks.

*Teqiang Zou,Hongliang Zeng,Yuxuan Nong,Yifan Li,Kehui Liu,Haotian Yang,Xinyang Ling,Xin Li,Lianyang Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents the DuoCore-FS framework, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system that operates asynchronously to enhance performance in robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action systems suffer from synchronous execution constraints, which limit control stability and real-time performance, particularly in complex robotic tasks involving whole-body motion.

Method: DuoCore-FS establishes a fast-slow pathway architecture with two main innovations: a latent representation buffer to connect slow reasoning with fast action generation, and a whole-body action tokenizer for compact action representation while enabling asynchronous execution.

Result: The framework supports a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model and achieves a high 30 Hz action generation rate, outperforming previous synchronous models in terms of speed and responsiveness.

Conclusion: DuoCore-FS improves task success rates and responsiveness, offering significant advancements in real-world robotic manipulation applications. The system is end-to-end trainable and has been deployed on the Astribot robotic platform.

Abstract: Most Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for semantic reasoning with an action expert generating continuous action signals, yet both typically run at a single unified frequency. As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines. The implementation of DuoCore-FS, including training, inference, and deployment, is provided to commercial users by Astribot as part of the Astribot robotic platform.

Abstract: Due to the limitations of a single autonomous vehicle, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technology opens a new window for achieving fully autonomous driving through sensor information sharing. However, real-world datasets supporting vehicle-infrastructure cooperative navigation in complex urban environments remain rare.

Our onboard platform provides synchronized data from multiple industrial cameras, LiDARs, 4D radar, ultra-wideband (UWB), IMU, and high-precision GNSS-RTK/INS navigation systems. Meanwhile, our roadside infrastructure provides LiDAR, GNSS, and UWB measurements. The entire vehicle-infrastructure platform is synchronized using the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), with sensor calibration data provided. We also benchmark various navigation algorithms to evaluate the collected cooperative data. The dataset is publicly available at https://polyu-taslab.github.io/UrbanV2X/.

TL;DR: This paper introduces KnowVal, an autonomous driving system combining visual-language reasoning and value alignment for enhanced decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing complex decision-making logic solely through data-driven techniques.

Method: KnowVal integrates open-world perception and a driving knowledge graph for reasoning, alongside value model training for trajectory assessment.

Result: KnowVal improves planning performance, reduces collision rates (tested on nuScenes), and achieves state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive.

Conclusion: Synergizing knowledge and visual-language reasoning enhances decision-making and compatibility with current systems.

Abstract: Visual-language reasoning, driving knowledge, and value alignment are essential for advanced autonomous driving systems. However, existing approaches largely rely on data-driven learning, making it difficult to capture the complex logic underlying decision-making through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. To address this, we propose KnowVal, a new autonomous driving system that enables visual-language reasoning through the synergistic integration of open-world perception and knowledge retrieval. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model to guide interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves planning performance while remaining compatible with existing architectures. Notably, KnowVal achieves the lowest collision rate on nuScenes and state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unique inflatable robot with pneumatic bladder links connected by Hillberry joints, showcasing better motion range, arm payload capacity, and movement potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance the applications of inflatable robots by improving joint range of motion, structural flexibility, and load-bearing capabilities.

Method: The authors designed an articulated inflatable robot combining a dual-layered tarpaulin-polyurethane bladder link and Hillberry rolling contact joints, achieving a wide motion range and durability.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the robot's ability to carry payloads up to 5 kg with different arm configurations and proved its feasibility for legged locomotion.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed inflatable robotic mechanism is a versatile and effective innovation for applications requiring flexibility, wide motion range, and load capacity.

Abstract: Exploration of various applications is the frontier of research on inflatable robots. We proposed an articulated robots consisting of multiple pneumatic bladder links connected by rolling contact joints called Hillberry joints. The bladder link is made of a double-layered structure of tarpaulin sheet and polyurethane sheet, which is both airtight and flexible in shape. The integration of the Hilberry joint into an inflatable robot is also a new approach. The rolling contact joint allows wide range of motion of $\pm 150 ^{\circ}$, the largest among the conventional inflatable joints. Using the proposed mechanism for inflatable robots, we demonstrated moving a 500 g payload with a 3-DoF arm and lifting 3.4 kg and 5 kg payloads with 2-DoF and 1-DoF arms, respectively. We also experimented with a single 3-DoF inflatable leg attached to a dolly to show that the proposed structure worked for legged locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FAR-AVIO is a computationally efficient underwater odometry framework using acoustic-visual-inertial data for precise real-time state estimation in challenging underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges underwater environments pose to visual-inertial odometry systems such as light attenuation, turbidity, weak motions, and frequent tracking failures.

Method: The method integrates a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter for joint pose-landmark optimization, alongside adaptive weight adjustment and reliability evaluation modules.

Result: Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments demonstrate FAR-AVIO's superior localization accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines.

Conclusion: FAR-AVIO enables robust underwater operation on resource-constrained platforms, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The implementation is open-source for wider use.

Abstract: Underwater environments impose severe challenges to visual-inertial odometry systems, as strong light attenuation, marine snow and turbidity, together with weakly exciting motions, degrade inertial observability and cause frequent tracking failures over long-term operation. While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms. Our implementation has been released as open source software at https://far-vido.gitbook.io/far-vido-docs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses autonomous drone racing using minimal sensors by correcting Visual-Inertial Odometry drift through Kalman filter fusion and optimizing trajectory planning, achieving podium finishes in various categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competition challenged teams to develop high-speed autonomous drone systems with limited sensors, imitating the capabilities of expert human pilots.

Method: The method involved correcting VIO drift using Kalman filter fusion with YOLO-based gate detection and generating perception-aware trajectories to optimize speed and visibility.

Result: The system achieved competitive performance with podium finishes in several categories, including high-speed races up to 59 km/h.

Conclusion: The developed architecture demonstrates the potential for monocular vision-based autonomous drone racing systems, offering valuable insights for improving speed and perception under minimal sensor setups.

Abstract: The Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League(A2RL) x Drone Champions League competition(DCL) requires teams to perform high-speed autonomous drone racing using only a single camera and a low-quality inertial measurement unit -- a minimal sensor set that mirrors expert human drone racing pilots. This sensor limitation makes the system susceptible to drift from Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly during long and fast flights with aggressive maneuvers. This paper presents the system developed for the championship, which achieved a competitive performance. Our approach corrected VIO drift by fusing its output with global position measurements derived from a YOLO-based gate detector using a Kalman filter. A perception-aware planner generated trajectories that balance speed with the need to keep gates visible for the perception system. The system demonstrated high performance, securing podium finishes across multiple categories: third place in the AI Grand Challenge with top speed of 43.2 km/h, second place in the AI Drag Race with over 59 km/h, and second place in the AI Multi-Drone Race. We detail the complete architecture and present a performance analysis based on experimental data from the competition, contributing our insights on building a successful system for monocular vision-based autonomous drone flight.

*Changyi Lin,Boda Huo,Mingyang Yu,Emily Ruppel,Bingqing Chen,Jonathan Francis,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LightTact introduces a deformation-independent, optics-based tactile sensor for high-contrast contact detection and light-contact robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tactile sensors struggle to detect light contact without visible surface deformation, limiting interaction with soft or fluid-like materials.

Method: LightTact employs an optical configuration that blocks non-contact illumination and transmits light from true contact areas for high-contrast pixel-level segmentation.

Result: LightTact demonstrates accurate contact detection unaffected by material properties or lighting and showcases light-contact robotic manipulation behaviors.

Conclusion: This sensor enables robust robotic interactions in challenging light-contact scenarios and offers new integration possibilities with vision-language models.

Abstract: Contact often occurs without macroscopic surface deformation, such as during interaction with liquids, semi-liquids, or ultra-soft materials. Most existing tactile sensors rely on deformation to infer contact, making such light-contact interactions difficult to perceive robustly. To address this, we present LightTact, a visual-tactile fingertip sensor that makes contact directly visible via a deformation-independent, optics-based principle. LightTact uses an ambient-blocking optical configuration that suppresses both external light and internal illumination at non-contact regions, while transmitting only the diffuse light generated at true contacts. As a result, LightTact produces high-contrast raw images in which non-contact pixels remain near-black (mean gray value < 3) and contact pixels preserve the natural appearance of the contacting surface. Built on this, LightTact achieves accurate pixel-level contact segmentation that is robust to material properties, contact force, surface appearance, and environmental lighting. We further integrate LightTact on a robotic arm and demonstrate manipulation behaviors driven by extremely light contact, including water spreading, facial-cream dipping, and thin-film interaction. Finally, we show that LightTact's spatially aligned visual-tactile images can be directly interpreted by existing vision-language models, enabling resistor value reasoning for robotic sorting.

*Wang Bin,Ao Yang,Kedan Li,Aofan Liu,Hui Li,Guibo Luo,Weixiang Huang,Yan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Attention Distance,' a novel metric using large language models for improving Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing (DGF), achieving significant efficiency gains in software security testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing approaches rely solely on physical distances, neglecting logical relationships among code elements, leading to suboptimal and misleading results.

Method: The authors propose the use of 'Attention Distance,' which employs large language models for contextual analysis to compute attention scores between code elements, to replace traditional physical distance metrics in fuzzing.

Result: Replacing physical distances with attention distances led to a 3.43x increase in testing efficiency over traditional methods in 38 vulnerability reproduction experiments, with further improvements of 2.89x and 7.13x compared to other state-of-the-art directed fuzzers.

Conclusion: Attention Distance effectively enhances the efficiency and accuracy of Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing, showing superior performance and adaptability in multiple fuzzing scenarios.

Abstract: In the domain of software security testing, Directed Grey-Box Fuzzing (DGF) has garnered widespread attention for its efficient target localization and excellent detection performance. However, existing approaches measure only the physical distance between seed execution paths and target locations, overlooking logical relationships among code segments. This omission can yield redundant or misleading guidance in complex binaries, weakening DGF's real-world effectiveness. To address this, we introduce \textbf{attention distance}, a novel metric that leverages a large language model's contextual analysis to compute attention scores between code elements and reveal their intrinsic connections. Under the same AFLGo configuration -- without altering any fuzzing components other than the distance metric -- replacing physical distances with attention distances across 38 real vulnerability reproduction experiments delivers a \textbf{3.43$\times$} average increase in testing efficiency over the traditional method. Compared to state-of-the-art directed fuzzers DAFL and WindRanger, our approach achieves \textbf{2.89$\times$} and \textbf{7.13$\times$} improvements, respectively. To further validate the generalizability of attention distance, we integrate it into DAFL and WindRanger, where it also consistently enhances their original performance. All related code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/TheBinKing/Attention\_Distance.git.

### [243] [A Declarative Language for Building And Orchestrating LLM-Powered Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19769)

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a declarative system for language model agents that separates workflow specification from implementation, making it easier to develop and deploy efficient workflows across different setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of tightly coupled agent logic and deployment models, and streamline development by abstracting workflows to a declarative level.

Method: Introduces a DSL (domain-specific language) for common workflow patterns that emphasizes configuration over imperative programming, supporting multi-language execution, A/B testing, and better scalability.

Result: The system achieved a 60% reduction in development time, 3x faster deployment rates, and allowed workflows to be expressed in significantly less code, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: This declarative approach simplifies and accelerates the development and deployment of complex agent workflows, while making them accessible to non-engineers and retaining performance efficiency.

Abstract: Building deployment-ready LLM agents requires complex orchestration of tools, data sources, and control flow logic, yet existing systems tightly couple agent logic to specific programming languages and deployment models. We present a declarative system that separates agent workflow specification from implementation, enabling the same pipeline definition to execute across multiple backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and deployment environments (cloud-native, on-premises).
  Our key insight is that most agent workflows consist of common patterns -- data serialization, filtering, RAG retrieval, API orchestration -- that can be expressed through a unified DSL rather than imperative code. This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment. Our system natively supports A/B testing of agent strategies, allowing multiple pipeline variants to run on the same backend infrastructure with automatic metric collection and comparison.
  We evaluate our approach on real-world e-commerce workflows at PayPal, processing millions of daily interactions. Our results demonstrate 60% reduction in development time, and 3x improvement in deployment velocity compared to imperative implementations. The language's declarative approach enables non-engineers to modify agent behaviors safely, while maintaining sub-100ms orchestration overhead. We show that complex workflows involving product search, personalization, and cart management can be expressed in under 50 lines of DSL compared to 500+ lines of imperative code.

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of code-comment inconsistency by proposing a new method that uses CodeT5+ to analyze code changes and outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring semantic consistency between source code and comments, which is crucial for program comprehension and long-term maintainability.

Method: The paper presents a Just-In-Time Code-Comment Inconsistency (CCI) detection method using CodeT5+, analyzing ordered sequences of code modifications like replacing, deleting, and adding for better semantic correlation.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to a 13.54% improvement in F1-Score over state-of-the-art models and substantial performance boosts compared to fine-tuned LLMs on benchmarks JITDATA and CCIBENCH.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles code-comment inconsistency by integrating the structural complexity of code evolution and surpasses existing methods, offering a robust solution for developers.

Abstract: Ensuring semantic consistency between source code and its accompanying comments is crucial for program comprehension, effective debugging, and long-term maintainability. Comment inconsistency arises when developers modify code but neglect to update the corresponding comments, potentially misleading future maintainers and introducing errors. Recent approaches to code-comment inconsistency (CCI) detection leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and rely on capturing the semantic relationship between code changes and outdated comments. However, they often ignore the structural complexity of code evolution, including historical change activities, and introduce privacy and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose a Just-In-Time CCI detection approach built upon the CodeT5+ backbone. Our method decomposes code changes into ordered sequences of modification activities such as replacing, deleting, and adding to more effectively capture the correlation between these changes and the corresponding outdated comments. Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets-JITDATA and CCIBENCH--demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by up to 13.54% in F1-Score and achieves an improvement ranging from 4.18% to 10.94% over fine-tuned LLMs including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama and Qwen2.5-Coder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the high performance of code language models on code tasks, their inner workings remain underexplored, particularly concerning their interpretability compared to models in natural language processing.

Method: The authors empirically investigate the neuron-level behavior of Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on code tasks across multiple programming languages by measuring neuron selectivity and layer contributions.

Result: The study identifies specialized neurons for specific languages and universal neurons for general-purpose tasks, showing lower layers encode syntax and middle layers capture shared semantic abstractions.

Conclusion: Neurons and concept layers in code LLMs can be leveraged to improve multilingual code tasks such as fine-tuning, clone detection, and code summarization, delivering consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Code language models excel on code intelligence tasks, yet their internal interpretability is underexplored. Existing neuron interpretability techniques from NLP are suboptimal for source code due to programming languages formal, hierarchical, and executable nature. We empirically investigate code LLMs at the neuron level, localizing language-specific neurons (selectively responsive to one language) and concept layers (feed-forward layers encoding language-agnostic code representations). We analyze Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on multilingual inputs in C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript, measuring neuron selectivity and layerwise contributions during generation. We find (1) neurons specialized for individual languages alongside a universal subset supporting general-purpose generation; and (2) lower layers mainly encode language-specific syntax, while middle layers capture semantic abstractions shared across languages, emerging as concept layers. We demonstrate utility on three tasks: neuron-guided fine-tuning for code generation, clone detection via concept-layer embeddings, and concept-layer-guided transfer for code summarization, each yielding consistent gains in multilingual settings.

### [246] [Detecting Non-Optimal Decisions of Embodied Agents via Diversity-Guided Metamorphic Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20083)
*Wenzhao Wu,Yahui Tang,Mingfei Cheng,Wenbing Tang,Yuan Zhou,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, NoD-DGMT, to address inefficiencies in embodied agent task planning by detecting non-optimal decisions using diversity-guided metamorphic testing. It outperforms baselines in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the inefficiency of embodied agents, which complete tasks successfully but suboptimally, leading to performance issues and resource wastage.

Method: The authors propose NoD-DGMT, utilizing four metamorphic relations and a diversity-guided selection strategy to detect non-optimal decisions in task planning of embodied agents.

Result: NoD-DGMT demonstrated a 31.9% detection rate of violations, with diversity-guided filtering improving both detection rates and diversity scores, outperforming six baseline approaches by 16.8%.

Conclusion: NoD-DGMT is an efficient and effective framework for pinpointing non-optimal decisions in embodied agents, enhancing performance across architectures and tasks.

Abstract: As embodied agents advance toward real-world deployment, ensuring optimal decisions becomes critical for resource-constrained applications. Current evaluation methods focus primarily on functional correctness, overlooking the non-functional optimality of generated plans. This gap can lead to significant performance degradation and resource waste. We identify and formalize the problem of Non-optimal Decisions (NoDs), where agents complete tasks successfully but inefficiently. We present NoD-DGMT, a systematic framework for detecting NoDs in embodied agent task planning via diversity-guided metamorphic testing. Our key insight is that optimal planners should exhibit invariant behavioral properties under specific transformations. We design four novel metamorphic relations capturing fundamental optimality properties: position detour suboptimality, action optimality completeness, condition refinement monotonicity, and scene perturbation invariance. To maximize detection efficiency, we introduce a diversity-guided selection strategy that actively selects test cases exploring different violation categories, avoiding redundant evaluations while ensuring comprehensive diversity coverage. Extensive experiments on the AI2-THOR simulator with four state-of-the-art planning models demonstrate that NoD-DGMT achieves violation detection rates of 31.9% on average, with our diversity-guided filter improving rates by 4.3% and diversity scores by 3.3 on average. NoD-DGMT significantly outperforms six baseline methods, with 16.8% relative improvement over the best baseline, and demonstrates consistent superiority across different model architectures and task complexities.

### [247] [AXIOM: Benchmarking LLM-as-a-Judge for Code via Rule-Based Perturbation and Multisource Quality Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20159)
*Ruiqi Wang,Xinchen Wang,Cuiyun Gao,Chun Yong Chong,Xin Xia,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces AXIOM, a framework to create robust, balanced code evaluation benchmarks for LLM-generated code by utilizing perturbation techniques and multisource quality calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code evaluation methods and benchmarks are limited due to their reliance on surface-level scoring, coarse labels, subjective criteria, and unbalanced synthesized data, which hinder accurate and reliable evaluation of LLM-generated code.

Method: The AXIOM framework synthesizes code benchmarks at scale through a two-stage process: (1) systematically modifying high-quality programs with predefined rules to manage target score distributions, and (2) applying multisource quality calibration to ensure realistic and balanced benchmarks.

Result: AXIOM produces benchmarks with well-defined and balanced score distributions across different quality levels, addressing issues in current evaluation metrics and providing a more reliable, scalable solution for assessing LLM-generated code.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes the limitations of prior methods, enhancing the evaluation process for LLM-generated code through rigorous benchmark synthesis and quality calibration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed in real-world software engineering, fostering the development of code evaluation metrics to study the quality of LLM-generated code. Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios.
  To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions. (2) Multisource quality calibration, which first selects a subset of...

*Zhenlei Ye,Xiaobing Sun,Sicong Cao,Lili Bo,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces \sysname, an LLM-based approach to address limitations in automated software vulnerability repairs by identifying patching locations and assessing patch quality during iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based vulnerability repair methods lack focus on patching locations and fail to perform quality assessment for patches during iterations.

Method: \sysname incorporates patch location identification and iterative patch selection by evaluating quality through dimensions like vulnerability introduction and taint statement coverage.

Result: \sysname outperforms prior approaches by producing 27 plausible patches and repairing 8-13 more vulnerabilities compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: \sysname significantly enhances generated patch quantity and quality for real-world vulnerability repair, demonstrating its effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The advances of large language models (LLMs) have paved the way for automated software vulnerability repair approaches, which iteratively refine the patch until it becomes plausible. Nevertheless, existing LLM-based vulnerability repair approaches face notable limitations: 1) they ignore the concern of locations that need to be patched and focus solely on the repair content. 2) they lack quality assessment for generated candidate patches in the iterative process.
  To tackle the two limitations, we propose \sysname, an LLM-based approach that provides information about where should be patched first. Furthermore, \sysname improves the iterative repair strategy by assessing the quality of test-failing patches and selecting the best patch for the next iteration. We introduce two dimensions to assess the quality of patches: whether they introduce new vulnerabilities and the taint statement coverage. We evaluated \sysname on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset VulnLoc+, which contains 40 vulnerabilities and their Proofs-of-Vulnerability. The experimental results demonstrate that \sysname exhibits substantial improvements compared with the Neural Machine Translation-based, Program Analysis-based, and LLM-based state-of-the-art vulnerability repair approaches. Specifically, \sysname is able to generate 27 plausible patches, which is comparable to or even 8 to 22 more plausible patches than the baselines. In terms of correct patch generation, \sysname repairs 8 to 13 additional vulnerabilities compared with existing approaches.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FeatureSHAP is an explainability framework designed for software engineering tasks that uses Shapley values to provide model-agnostic explanations for LLM outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models excel in software engineering tasks but lack explainability, a crucial factor for trust and adoption in high-stakes domains.

Method: FeatureSHAP uses Shapley values to systematically attribute model outputs to input features through input perturbation and task-specific similarity, ensuring compatibility with both open-source and proprietary LLMs.

Result: FeatureSHAP outperforms baseline methods in fidelity and relevance of explanations and is positively received by practitioners in aiding decision-making.

Conclusion: FeatureSHAP advances practical explainable AI in software engineering, fostering trust and better interpretability in LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially advanced the automation of software engineering (SE) tasks, enabling complex activities such as code generation and code summarization. However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP.

*Yuan Huang,Yukang Zhou,Xiangping Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Cursor generate defective code when prompted with defective commented-out code (CO code).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of defective commented-out code on AI coding assistants and improve their robustness and reliability in generating secure code.

Method: The study evaluates two AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, through experiments analyzing their behavior when exposed to defective CO code in contextual prompts.

Result: Defective CO code in prompts increased the rate of defective code generation by up to 58.17%. Despite explicit instructions to ignore defective CO code, the defect generation was only reduced by 21.84%, showing that tools reason beyond copying and complete defects.

Conclusion: AI coding assistants demonstrate susceptibility to defective CO code, necessitating stronger security and robustness measures to enhance reliability in code generation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models in code generation, AI-powered editors such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor are revolutionizing software development practices. At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate.
  This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants.

*Xiaoxue Ma,Wanwei Zhan,Jiale Chen,Yishu Li,Jacky Keung,Federica Sarro*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes challenges in distributed deep learning frameworks by studying 849 issues in frameworks like DeepSpeed and Colossal-AI, identifying common bugs, causes, and fixes, and offering actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning requires processing large datasets that exceed the computational and memory limits of single-device setups. While distributed frameworks enable scaling, existing general-purpose frameworks often lack user-friendly, specialized tools, creating a need for better solutions.

Method: The authors analyzed 849 real-world issues from distributed deep learning frameworks (DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI), developed a taxonomy of bugs, and mapped symptoms, root causes, and fixes systematically.

Result: 45.1% of bugs are specific to distributed frameworks with setup failures, memory problems, and performance issues as key challenges. Communication setup frequently faces unique distributed challenges, and over 60% of issues can be resolved with software environment and dependency tuning.

Conclusion: The study systematically highlights unique challenges in distributed deep learning frameworks, provides actionable insights for resolution, and emphasizes the necessity of robust specialized tools to tackle these issues effectively.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, deep learning is vital for processing massive datasets, yet single-device training is constrained by computational and memory limits. Distributed deep learning overcomes these challenges by leveraging multiple GPUs or machines in parallel. While general-purpose frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow and PyTorch) provide distributed capabilities, these are often add-on features that demand significant manual effort for advanced parallelism, underscoring the need for specialized frameworks. This study conducts the first large-scale empirical analysis of practitioner challenges in dedicated distributed frameworks. We examine 849 real-world issues from DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI and construct a taxonomy of 34 bug symptoms, 28 root causes, and 6 fix patterns. Crucially, we establish explicit mappings between symptoms, causes, and fixes across distributed training stages, enabling a systematic understanding of how issues emerge and are resolved. Our results show that 45.1\% of bug symptoms are unique to distributed frameworks, with setup failures, memory issues, and performance anomalies being the most prevalent. Moreover, 95\% of issues in the communication setup stage occur exclusively in distributed contexts. We also find over 60\% of cases can be resolved through version and dependency management, and distributed feature, API, and communication tuning. Based on these findings, we provide actionable implications.

*Syeda Tasnim Fabiha,Saad Shafiq,Wesley Klewerton Guez Assunção,Nenad Medvidović*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rake, a deep reinforcement learning-based method for service decomposition in legacy systems, achieving better modularization and business capability alignment compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modernizing legacy systems using service-based architecture is challenging, especially in areas like defining appropriate service sizes without relying on extensive documentation, personnel, or predefined service numbers.

Method: The authors propose Rake, a reinforcement learning technique leveraging system documentation and source code to identify services, without dependency on language or personnel. The technique uses an objective function to balance modularization quality and business capability.

Result: Rake performed better than state-of-the-art methods, improving modularization quality by 7-14% and business capability alignment by 18-22% in experiments on four open-source legacy projects.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Rake is effective for service decomposition, but balancing objectives is necessary to avoid quality degradation in tightly coupled systems.

Abstract: Service-based architecture (SBA) has gained attention in industry and academia as a means to modernize legacy systems. It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SweRank+, a multilingual framework for precise issue localization in codebases, surpassing existing approaches with iterative reasoning and advanced tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve issue localization in large-scale multilingual codebases by addressing limitations like Python-centric bias and single-pass search methodologies in existing approaches.

Method: SweRank+ consists of SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking retriever and reranker trained on a diverse dataset, and SweRankAgent, which uses iterative multi-turn reasoning with a memory buffer to improve code issue localization.

Result: SweRankMulti achieves state-of-the-art performance for issue localization, and SweRankAgent further enhances performance by improving localization through iterative reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, SweRank+, significantly advances the accuracy and flexibility of issue localization in multilingual codebases by combining advanced cross-lingual ranking and iterative search strategies.

Abstract: Maintaining large-scale, multilingual codebases hinges on accurately localizing issues, which requires mapping natural-language error descriptions to the relevant functions that need to be modified. However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.

*Yingchao Yu,Pengfei Sun,Yaochu Jin,Kuangrong Hao,Hao Zhang,Yifeng Zhang,Wenxuan Pan,Wei Chen,Danyal Akarca,Yuchen Xiao*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores how self-motion can serve as a structural prior for organizing cognitive maps, which improves spatial representation and navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of assuming that sensory anchoring alone stabilizes cognitive maps, especially under sensory ambiguity or conflict, by investigating the deeper role self-motion might play in spatial representations.

Method: Introduced a path-integration-based motion prior within a predictive-coding framework, implemented through a brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation, and adaptive thresholds. Applied and analyzed this across various environments, including a quadrupedal robot.

Result: The motion prior demonstrated stabilization of spatial maps, improved local and global spatial accuracy, and better next-step predictions even under sensory ambiguity. It also generalized to unseen environments and outperformed simpler motion constraints.

Conclusion: The study highlights the organizing role of self-motion in spatial cognition, advancing both scientific understanding and practical capabilities in artificial agents' navigation systems.

Abstract: Most computational accounts of cognitive maps assume that stability is achieved primarily through sensory anchoring, with self-motion contributing to incremental positional updates only. However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents.

*Alexis Pomares Pastor,Ines Ribeiro Violante,Gregory Scott*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores a deep learning approach to classify EEG responses evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation for objective consciousness measurement in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical practice lacks objective tools to assess consciousness levels, particularly in cases such as brain injury or seizures. Neurophysiological methods that infer awareness through command following face challenges in reliably measuring brain states.

Method: Researchers collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants, applying transcranial direct current stimulation to posterior cortical areas. They employed deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, to classify brain responses.

Result: The best CNN model achieved a 92% F1-score in classifying brain responses, significantly outperforming human-level accuracy of 60-70%, with robust results on unseen participants.

Conclusion: The study offers a promising framework for bedside consciousness measurement, enables clinical utility, and shares open-source datasets and tools to encourage replication and innovation in neuroscience and AI research.

Abstract: A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).
  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.
  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.
  These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use. In this spirit, we documented and open-sourced our datasets and codebase in full, to be used freely by the neuroscience and AI research communities, who may replicate our results with free tools like GitHub, Kaggle, and Colab.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the brain balances gradual meaning accumulation and rapid reconfiguration during language comprehension using a large language model and high-precision fMRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the brain implements two essential processes for language coherence: gradual accumulation of meaning and rapid shifts at event boundaries, especially during naturalistic listening.

Method: The study used an annotation-free approach based on signals derived from a large language model, combined with voxelwise encoding models from ultra high-field (7T) BOLD fMRI data collected over 7 hours of narrative listening.

Result: Drift signals linked to contextual integration were prevalent in the default-mode network, while shift signals representing event changes were found in the auditory and language association cortex. Additionally, meaning accumulation was tied to the default-mode and parietal networks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight distinct neural mechanisms for slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reorganization during language comprehension, providing insights into language coherence and potential disturbances in psychiatric contexts.

Abstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.

*Joonsung Kang*

TL;DR: This paper presents a robust framework for determining causal directionality in quantum engineering, using a CVAE-based and MNAR-stabilized method that addresses both quantum and classical noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of distinguishing causal directionality in quantum systems, given the active role of observation and MNAR data complexities.

Method: A unified framework combining CVAE-based latent constraints, MNAR-aware selection models, GEE-stabilized regression, penalized empirical likelihood, and Bayesian optimization is introduced.

Result: The approach lowers bias and variance, improves coverage and diagnostics, and is validated through simulations and real data (e.g., TCGA gene expression and proteomics).

Conclusion: The framework is a methodological advance in robust causal directionality inference, crucial for reliable quantum engineering.

Abstract: In quantum mechanics, observation actively shapes the system, paralleling the statistical notion of Missing Not At Random (MNAR). This study introduces a unified framework for \textbf{robust causal directionality inference} in quantum engineering, determining whether relations are system$\to$observation, observation$\to$system, or bidirectional.
  The method integrates CVAE-based latent constraints, MNAR-aware selection models, GEE-stabilized regression, penalized empirical likelihood, and Bayesian optimization. It jointly addresses quantum and classical noise while uncovering causal directionality, with theoretical guarantees for double robustness, perturbation stability, and oracle inequalities.
  Simulation and real-data analyses (TCGA gene expression, proteomics) show that the proposed MNAR-stabilized CVAE+GEE+AIPW+PEL framework achieves lower bias and variance, near-nominal coverage, and superior quantum-specific diagnostics. This establishes robust causal directionality inference as a key methodological advance for reliable quantum engineering.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a convex loss function for quasiprobabilistic density-ratio estimation and an extended Sliced-Wasserstein distance for performance measurement, demonstrating effectiveness on particle physics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loss functions for density-ratio estimation struggle with ensuring a continuous and surjective relationship in quasiprobabilistic settings. A new approach is needed for better reliability and performance.

Method: The authors propose a convex loss function for density-ratio estimation and introduce an extended Sliced-Wasserstein distance for evaluating quasiprobabilistic distributions.

Result: Using a real-world particle physics example, this new method achieves state-of-the-art results for density ratio estimation, demonstrating improved performance and accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses issues in quasiprobabilistic density-ratio estimation, offering a more robust loss function and measurement tool applicable in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We consider a generalization of the classifier-based density-ratio estimation task to a quasiprobabilistic setting where probability densities can be negative. The problem with most loss functions used for this task is that they implicitly define a relationship between the optimal classifier and the target quasiprobabilistic density ratio which is discontinuous or not surjective. We address these problems by introducing a convex loss function that is well-suited for both probabilistic and quasiprobabilistic density ratio estimation. To quantify performance, an extended version of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced which is compatible with quasiprobability distributions. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world example from particle physics, of di-Higgs production in association with jets via gluon-gluon fusion, and achieve state-of-the-art results.

*Zhihan Huang,Ziang Niu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper develops a universally consistent nonparametric score-based goodness-of-fit (GoF) test called SKSD, leveraging integral probability metrics (IPMs) and kernelized Stein's function class.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional score-based GoF tests require only null model fitting but lack powerful nonparametric alternatives due to improper score functions. The paper aims to overcome this limitation using a novel approach.

Method: By connecting score-based GoF tests to IPMs indexed by rich function classes, the authors create a new SKSD test using kernelized Stein's function class, supported by a parametric bootstrap.

Result: The SKSD test is computationally efficient, universally consistent, and handles nuisance parameters. It performs comparably to task-specific tests in power while accommodating models with complicated likelihoods.

Conclusion: The SKSD test establishes a computationally practical and robust alternative for GoF testing, applicable to general nonparametric alternatives and complex models.

Abstract: Goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests are fundamental for assessing model adequacy. Score-based tests are appealing because they require fitting the model only once under the null. However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method. Our method achieves power comparable to task-specific normality tests such as Anderson-Darling and Lilliefors, despite being designed for general nonparametric alternatives.

*Anna R. Flowers,Christopher T. Franck,Robert B. Gramacy,Justin A. Krometis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to guide data collection for machine learning models by leveraging metadata and Gaussian process surrogates to identify deficiencies and improve performance efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting realistic operational data for machine learning models is expensive, and understanding model deficiencies before acquiring new data is essential.

Method: The method involves analyzing model performance by varying training data based on metadata and using Gaussian process surrogates to guide targeted data acquisition.

Result: The proposed meta-learning approach improves model performance compared to randomly selected data acquisition, demonstrated through classic examples and aerial image applications.

Conclusion: Efficient data acquisition guided by model deficiencies and metadata can significantly improve machine learning performance.

Abstract: Collecting operationally realistic data to inform machine learning models can be costly. Before collecting new data, it is helpful to understand where a model is deficient. For example, object detectors trained on images of rare objects may not be good at identification in poorly represented conditions. We offer a way of informing subsequent data acquisition to maximize model performance by leveraging the toolkit of computer experiments and metadata describing the circumstances under which the training data was collected (e.g., season, time of day, location). We do this by evaluating the learner as the training data is varied according to its metadata. A Gaussian process (GP) surrogate fit to that response surface can inform new data acquisitions. This meta-learning approach offers improvements to learner performance as compared to data with randomly selected metadata, which we illustrate on both classic learning examples, and on a motivating application involving the collection of aerial images in search of airplanes.

### [261] [Generative Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20051)
*Hedibert Lopes,Nick Polson,Vadim Sokolov*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel generative approach to hyper-parameter tuning, introducing a lookup-table-like framework combining Bayesian posterior approximations and transport map learning for efficient exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyper-parameter selection is crucial for balancing regularization, model capacity, and robustness in machine learning but is often computationally intensive or difficult with existing methods.

Method: The authors integrate Bayesian posterior approximations using randomized weighted objectives with a transport map learning technique that efficiently maps hyper-parameters to optimizers.

Result: The method enables rapid evaluation of hyper-parameters and supports predictive tuning objectives alongside approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: The proposed approach connects optimization strategies to weighted $M$-estimation, offering an efficient, generative solution that advances hyper-parameter selection capabilities in machine learning.

Abstract: \noindent Hyper-parameter selection is a central practical problem in modern machine learning, governing regularization strength, model capacity, and robustness choices. Cross-validation is often computationally prohibitive at scale, while fully Bayesian hyper-parameter learning can be difficult due to the cost of posterior sampling. We develop a generative perspective on hyper-parameter tuning that combines two ideas: (i) optimization-based approximations to Bayesian posteriors via randomized, weighted objectives (weighted Bayesian bootstrap), and (ii) amortization of repeated optimization across many hyper-parameter settings by learning a transport map from hyper-parameters (including random weights) to the corresponding optimizer. This yields a ``generator look-up table'' for estimators, enabling rapid evaluation over grids or continuous ranges of hyper-parameters and supporting both predictive tuning objectives and approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification. We connect this viewpoint to weighted $M$-estimation, envelope/auxiliary-variable representations that reduce non-quadratic losses to weighted least squares, and recent generative samplers for weighted $M$-estimators.

*Mebin Jose,Jisha Francis,Sudheesh Kumar Kattumannil*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAN-AFT, a framework using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance the parametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model with both interpretability and predictive performance compared to current deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survival analysis models like CoxPH and AFT struggle with rigid assumptions and lack interpretability, with deep learning approaches (e.g., DeepAFT) remaining black-box solutions.

Method: KAN-AFT integrates Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) into the AFT model, incorporates robust optimization strategies for handling right-censored data, and provides interpretability via symbolic equations for survival time.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that KAN-AFT matches or exceeds DeepAFT's predictive performance, offering unique interpretive advantages through clear symbolic representations.

Conclusion: KAN-AFT combines predictive accuracy with symbolic interpretability, addressing challenges in survival analysis methods and advancing practical application.

Abstract: Survival analysis relies fundamentally on the semi-parametric Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model and the parametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. CoxPH assumes constant hazard ratios, often failing to capture real-world dynamics, while traditional AFT models are limited by rigid distributional assumptions. Although deep learning models like DeepAFT address these constraints by improving predictive accuracy and handling censoring, they inherit the significant challenge of black-box interpretability. The recent introduction of CoxKAN demonstrated the successful integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel architecture that yields highly accurate and interpretable symbolic representations, within the CoxPH framework. Motivated by the interpretability gains of CoxKAN, we introduce KAN-AFT (Kolmogorov Arnold Network-based AFT), the first framework to apply KANs to the AFT model. KAN-AFT effectively models complex nonlinear relationships within the AFT framework. Our primary contributions include: (i) a principled AFT-KAN formulation, (ii) robust optimization strategies for right-censored observations (e.g., Buckley-James and IPCW), and (iii) an interpretability pipeline that converts the learned spline functions into closed-form symbolic equations for survival time. Empirical results on multiple datasets confirm that KAN-AFT achieves performance comparable to or better than DeepAFT, while uniquely providing transparent, symbolic models of the survival process.

### [263] [Avoiding the Price of Adaptivity: Inference in Linear Contextual Bandits via Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20368)
*Samya Praharaj,Koulik Khamaru*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper examines statistical inference in adaptive, non-i.i.d. contextual bandits, proposing a penalized EXP4 algorithm that achieves valid inference and optimal regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Statistical inference in contextual bandits is challenging because data collected under adaptive policies is non-i.i.d., and classical methods often fail. This motivates the need for statistically efficient and reliable methods for inference in this setting.

Method: The paper proposes the penalized EXP4 algorithm, leveraging the stability condition to ensure valid confidence intervals and minimax optimal regret bounds.

Result: The proposed algorithm satisfies the Lai-Wei stability condition, enabling valid Wald-type confidence intervals without the adaptivity penalty. It also achieves minimax optimal regret guarantees up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that it is possible to achieve both statistical stability and efficiency in contextual bandit methods, validated through theoretical results and simulations.

Abstract: Statistical inference in contextual bandits is complicated by the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\sqrt{d \log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies.
  A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \emph{without} incurring the $\sqrt{d \log T}$ price of adaptivity.
  In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals.

### [264] [Shallow Neural Networks Learn Low-Degree Spherical Polynomials with Learnable Channel Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20562)
*Yingzhen Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper improves sample complexity for learning spherical polynomials using an over-parameterized two-layer neural network with channel attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in sample complexity for learning spherical polynomials and achieve minimax optimal regression risk rates.

Method: Design and train a two-layer NN with channel attention across two stages: Stage 1—select ground-truth channels using GD; Stage 2—train the second layer for feature learning.

Result: The proposed method achieves the lowest sample complexity of $n \sim Θ(d^{\ell_0}/\eps)$, reaching minimax optimal rates for regression risk.

Conclusion: The training framework efficiently learns low-degree polynomials, attains minimax optimal regression risk, and improves sample complexity.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a low-degree spherical polynomial of degree $\ell_0 = Θ(1) \ge 1$ defined on the unit sphere in $\RR^d$ by training an over-parameterized two-layer neural network (NN) with channel attention in this paper. Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\eps \in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \ge Θ({n^4 \log (2n/δ)}/{d^{2\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \asymp Θ(d^{\ell_0}/\eps)$ with probability $1-δ$ for every $δ\in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $Θ\pth{d^{\ell_0} \max\set{\eps^{-2},\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-δ$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\ell_0$ from the initial $L \ge \ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets. In Stage 2, the second layer is trained by standard GD using the activation function with the selected channels.

### [265] [Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20391)
*Georg Schildbach*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a decentralized, communicationless collision avoidance system for robot swarms through implicit cooperation via pre-established rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reliable collision avoidance in robot swarms, especially considering that communication between robots is often fragile and prone to faults.

Method: The proposed Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) uses implicit cooperation, where offline rules define contingency trajectories and mutual collision avoidance criteria, without requiring robot-to-robot communication.

Result: CMC guarantees recursive feasibility and collision avoidance under closed-loop operation, while supporting seamless integration of new robots into the swarm.

Conclusion: CMC provides a robust solution for swarm collision avoidance without relying on communication, enhancing reliability and scalability in practical swarm operations.

Abstract: Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.

### [266] [Optimality-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Parametric Optimization Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20270)
*Matthias K. Hoffmann,Amine Othmane,Kathrin Flaßkamp*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs) to efficiently predict solutions for nonlinear constrained optimization problems by embedding optimality conditions and feasibility into the neural network's design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving parametric, nonlinear constrained optimization problems across a wide range of parameters is computationally expensive and can benefit from efficient, learning-based surrogate models suited for control and model-based design tasks.

Method: The authors propose OptINNs, which utilize KKT-residual-based loss to ensure optimality, enforce constraint adherence through output activations, and use problem-specific design to predict both primal solutions and dual variables.

Result: OptINNs demonstrate comparable or superior performance compared to quadratic-penalty baselines by achieving better primal accuracy, lower constraint violations, and successful dual prediction, particularly in complex, higher-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: OptINNs provide a more feasible, accurate, and data-efficient learning-based approach to parametric optimization by embedding feasibility and optimality directly into the neural network structure and training loss.

Abstract: Many engineering tasks require solving families of nonlinear constrained optimization problems, parametrized in setting-specific variables. This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization.

*Jian Xue,Qian Zhang,Wu Zhu*

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of generative AI on financial analysts' productivity, finding significant improvements in report quality but increases in forecast errors due to cognitive challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how generative AI, specifically FactSet's 2023 platform, affects the work quality, efficiency, and decision-making abilities of financial analysts.

Method: The authors use the launch of FactSet's AI platform as a natural experiment, analyzing metrics such as information richness, topical coverage, analytical methods, timing, and forecast errors. Placebo tests ensure results are tied to AI adoption.

Result: Reports generated by analysts using the AI platform become richer, broader, and more timely, but forecast errors increase by 59% due to the complexity of synthesizing more balanced information.

Conclusion: Generative AI can enhance productivity and enrich content but also challenges cognitive capacities, uncovering trade-offs between information quality and usability in financial analysis.

Abstract: We study how generative artificial intelligence (AI) transforms the work of financial analysts. Using the 2023 launch of FactSet's AI platform as a natural experiment, we find that adoption produces markedly richer and more comprehensive reports -- featuring 40% more distinct information sources, 34% broader topical coverage, and 25% greater use of advanced analytical methods -- while also improving timeliness. However, forecast errors rise by 59% as AI-assisted reports convey a more balanced mix of positive and negative information that is harder to synthesize, particularly for analysts facing heavier cognitive demands. Placebo tests using other data vendors confirm that these effects are unique to FactSet's AI integration. Overall, our findings reveal both the productivity gains and cognitive limits of generative AI in financial information production.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper investigates time-varying equity-premium predictability across economic regimes and proposes improved methods for forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent research suggests equity-premium predictability varies significantly across economic regimes, often focusing on recessionary periods. The study aims to advance our understanding of these predictive variations.

Method: The paper introduces a state-switching predictive regression model using yield curve slope to define market states. It also proposes a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed using partial least squares (PLS).

Result: The state-switching model improves predictive performance in sample and out of sample, especially for popular predictors. The Aligned Economic Index achieves significant predictive accuracy, outperforming standard methods and benchmarks.

Conclusion: State-based models and the Aligned Economic Index enhance equity-premium forecasting, offering strong evidence of time-varying returns in both expansionary and contractionary states.

Abstract: A growing empirical literature suggests that equity-premium predictability is state dependent, with much of the forecasting power concentrated around recessionary periods \parencite{Henkel2011,DanglHalling2012,Devpura2018}. I study U.S. stock return predictability across economic regimes and document strong evidence of time-varying expected returns across both expansionary and contractionary states. I contribute in two ways. First, I introduce a state-switching predictive regression in which the market state is defined in real time using the slope of the yield curve. Relative to the standard one-state predictive regression, the state-switching specification increases both in-sample and out-of-sample performance for the set of popular predictors considered by \textcite{WelchGoyal2008}, improving the out-of-sample performance of most predictors in economically meaningful ways. Second, I propose a new aggregate predictor, the Aligned Economic Index, constructed via partial least squares (PLS). Under the state-switching model, the Aligned Economic Index exhibits statistically and economically significant predictive power in sample and out of sample, and it outperforms widely used benchmark predictors and alternative predictor-combination methods.

Motivation: To address the challenge of organizing and efficiently extracting the most prominent features in higher-order persistent homology, especially for large datasets.

Method: The paper introduces a structural decomposition theorem to organize exterior-power layers and proposes a best-first algorithm for computing the Top-$K$ longest intervals. Additionally, stability properties under bottleneck perturbations and lower bounds are analyzed.

Result: The approach is proven to be theoretically sound, achieving speedups in high overlap cases. Experiments confirm the practical viability of the method by enabling faster computation of prominent features.

Conclusion: Efficient extraction of higher-order persistent features is made feasible for large datasets, enhancing applicability in fields such as machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.

Abstract: Exterior powers play important roles in persistent homology in computational geometry. In the present paper we study the problem of extracting the $K$ longest intervals of the exterior-power layers of a tame persistence module. We prove a structural decomposition theorem that organizes the exterior-power layers into monotone per-anchor streams with explicit multiplicities, enabling a best-first algorithm. We also show that the Top-$K$ length vector is $2$-Lipschitz under bottleneck perturbations of the input barcode, and prove a comparison-model lower bound. Our experiments confirm the theory, showing speedups over full enumeration in high overlap cases. By enabling efficient extraction of the most prominent features, our approach makes higher-order persistence feasible for large datasets and thus broadly applicable to machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.

TL;DR: A novel attitude control law is introduced for rotational systems using a generalized axis-angle method, showing improved stabilization times and lower control effort compared to quaternion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve control efficiency and stabilization times in rotational systems by enhancing the flexibility of control law design beyond quaternion-based schemes.

Method: The method uses a generalized axis-angle representation, Lyapunov's stability theory, and extended $K_{\infty}$ functions to enforce global asymptotic stability. It incorporates switching schemes dependent on angular velocity.

Result: Simulations and experiments confirm faster stabilization and reduced control effort during high-speed tumble-recovery maneuvers compared to quaternion and geometric-control methods.

Conclusion: The generalized axis-angle approach offers superior performance and flexibility in rotational system control compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We introduce a new class of attitude control laws for rotational systems, which generalizes the use of the Euler axis-angle representation beyond quaternion-based formulations. Using basic Lyapunov's stability theory and the notion of extended $K_{\infty}$ functions, we developed a method for determining and enforcing the global asymptotic stability of the single fixed point of the resulting closed-loop (CL) scheme. In contrast with traditional quaternion-based methods, the proposed generalized axis-angle approach enables greater flexibility in the design of the control law, which is of great utility when employed in combination with a switching scheme whose transition state depends on the angular velocity of the controlled rotational system. Through simulation and real-time experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. According to the recorded data, in the execution of high-speed tumble-recovery maneuvers, the new method consistently achieves shorter stabilization times and requires lower control effort relative to those corresponding to the quaternion-based and geometric-control methods used as benchmarks.

However, their deployment in practice must balance inference cost, latency, and reliability. In this work, we study an edge-cloud-expert cascaded LLM-based knowledge system that supports decision-making through a question-and-answer pipeline. In it, an efficient edge model handles routine queries, a more capable cloud model addresses complex cases, and human experts are involved only when necessary. We define a misalignment-cost constrained optimization problem, aiming to minimize average processing cost, while guaranteeing alignment of automated answers with expert judgments. We propose a statistically rigorous threshold selection method based on multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) for a query processing mechanism based on knowledge and confidence tests. The approach provides finite-sample guarantees on misalignment risk. Experiments on the TeleQnA dataset -- a telecom-specific benchmark -- demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cost-efficiency compared to conventional cascaded baselines, while ensuring reliability at prescribed confidence levels.

*Kyriakos Stylianopoulos,Paolo Di Lorenzo,George C. Alexandropoulos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how programmable metasurfaces can enable wireless channels to process data for edge inference while reducing energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond data transmission paradigms by enabling cooperative communications between a Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) for efficient edge inference, leveraging programmable wireless channels.

Method: The authors propose treating the TX, RX, and metasurface-based wireless channel as a single deep neural network trained using backpropagation for inference tasks using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM).

Result: The Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) achieves comparable inference performance to fully digital neural networks under various conditions, utilizing programmable metasurfaces.

Conclusion: Integrating metasurfaces into neural networks for communication systems can enhance computational efficiency and energy savings by reducing transceiver workload and transmission power.

Abstract: Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference.

*Cagatay Isil,Alexander Chen,Yuhang Li,F. Onuralp Ardic,Shiqi Chen,Che-Yung Shen,Aydogan Ozcan*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a compact 3D display system using digital encoding and diffractive optical decoding to project 3D images with high resolution and minimal cross-talk, achieving wavelength-scale axial separations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in 3D image projection, specifically diffraction-induced cross-talk in dense depth multiplexing, and develop a system with high fidelity and axial resolution.

Method: The system employs a digital encoder using a Fourier encoder network and a multi-layer diffractive optical decoder. Deep learning end-to-end optimization is used to achieve accurate depth-resolved 3D image projections in a single snapshot.

Result: The system demonstrated wavelength-scale axial separations, achieved volumetric images with 28 slices, and dynamically reconfigured axial image planes on demand. Experimental results closely matched the theoretical models.

Conclusion: This diffractive 3D display system provides a scalable and compact solution for depth-resolved 3D imaging, with potential applications in holograms, AR/VR, and optical computing.

Abstract: 3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This study introduces a new method for estimating Riesz representers using score matching, addressing overfitting issues in density ratio estimation applications like causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve causal inference methods by mitigating overfitting in density ratio estimation.

Method: Extends score-matching-based density ratio estimation techniques to Riesz representer estimation.

Result: Proposed method reduces overfitting and enhances insights into causal inference, particularly linking marginal effects and average policy effects.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust framework for debiased machine learning and causal inference by leveraging score matching-based techniques for efficient estimation of Riesz representers.

Abstract: This study proposes Riesz representer estimation methods based on score matching. The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.

*Sarah Alsubaie,Sakhaa Alsaedi,Xin Gao*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper analyzes 103 tools for non-targeted analysis and identifies challenges with reproducibility, openness, and portability in laboratory workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arose from the 2008 melamine contamination crisis, exposing gaps in laboratories' ability to verify unforeseen compounds and ensure reproducibility of independent analyses.

Method: The paper assesses tools using six pillars derived from FAIR and BP4NTA principles: validation, data/code availability, standardized formats, knowledge integration, and portable implementations.

Result: Findings reveal that while data-sharing increased from 56% to 86% over 21 years, the ability to replicate workflows dropped from 55% to 43%. Validation and portability rarely coexist, and no tools were specifically aimed at food safety.

Conclusion: Strengthening reproducibility pillars (validation, portability, and standardization) can transform static documentation into repeatable workflows, aiding laboratories in verifying non-targeted analysis results uniformly.

Abstract: In 2008, melamine in infant formula forced laboratories across three continents to verify a compound they had never monitored. Non-targeted analysis using LC/GC-HRMS handles these cases. But when findings trigger regulatory action, reproducibility becomes operational: can an independent laboratory repeat the analysis and reach the same conclusion?
  We assessed 103 tools (2004-2025) against six pillars drawn from FAIR and BP4NTA principles: laboratory validation (C1), data availability (C2), code availability (C3), standardised formats (C4), knowledge integration (C5), and portable implementation (C6). Health contributed 51 tools, Pharma 31, and Chemistry 21.
  Nine in ten tools shared data (C2, 90/103, 87%). Fewer than four in ten supported portable implementations (C6, 40/103, 39%). Validation and portability rarely appeared together (C1+C6, 18/103, 17%). Over twenty-one years, openness climbed from 56% to 86% while operability dropped from 55% to 43%. No tool addressed food safety.
  Journal data-sharing policies increased what authors share but not what reviewers can run. Tools became easier to find but harder to execute. Strengthening C1, C4, and C6 would turn documented artifacts into workflows that external laboratories can replay.

*Fernando M. de Paula Neto,Lucas dos Reis Silva,Paulo S. G. de Mattos Neto,Felipe F. Fanchini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a genetic algorithm framework for designing compact and efficient quantum neural network (QNN) architectures for regression tasks, competing with classical regression models and utilizing dataset complexity metrics for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of selecting optimal quantum circuit architectures for regression tasks, a quantum counterpart to the classical difficulty of neural network architecture selection, which is computationally hard.

Method: The authors propose an automated approach using a genetic algorithm framework that optimizes quantum circuit depth, parametrized gate configurations, and data re-uploading patterns. They evaluate the optimized quantum architectures against classical regression models on benchmark problems.

Result: The optimized quantum models exhibit comparable or competitive performance to classical regression models, requiring significantly fewer parameters. Dataset complexity metrics predict which quantum model works best, achieving high predictive accuracy in multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding in quantum regression by providing a meta-learning-driven, systematic approach to designing quantum neural network architectures. It underscores the potential of using dataset complexity measures for efficient and effective QNN design, paving the way for more robust quantum regression systems.

Abstract: The performance of quantum neural network models depends strongly on architectural decisions, including circuit depth, placement of parametrized operations, and data-encoding strategies. Selecting an effective architecture is challenging and closely related to the classical difficulty of choosing suitable neural-network topologies, which is computationally hard. This work investigates automated quantum-circuit construction for regression tasks and introduces a genetic-algorithm framework that discovers Reduced Regressor QNN architectures. The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work. These findings pave the way for more systematic and theoretically grounded approaches to quantum regression.

*Mark M. Wilde*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops methods for training quantum Boltzmann machines for generative modeling and quantum state learning, including gradient estimation using quantum computers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem is to effectively train quantum Boltzmann machines, which has faced obstacles in gradient estimation for quantum state learning involving both visible and hidden units.

Method: Analytical expressions for gradients of quantum relative entropy and Petz-Tsallis relative entropy are derived. Associated quantum algorithms are proposed using modular-flow-generated unitary rotations.

Result: The paper introduces methods for gradient estimation, extends expressions for classical and quantum unit combinations, and innovates with entropy-based objectives.

Conclusion: Progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines is achieved, enhancing generative modeling and quantum state learning capabilities.

Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.

Our SER-based model provides superior performance compared with other existing text-driven models to forecast stock returns out of sample and offers highly interpretable feature structures to examine the mechanisms underlying the stock return predictability. We further provide various implications based on SER and highlight the crucial benefit of structured model inputs in stock return predictability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the feasibility of transitioning 5G Core's cryptographic algorithms to post-quantum alternatives, ensuring security against quantum computing threats while maintaining network efficiency.

Method: Simulation modeling of user equipment (UE) registration/deregistration while implementing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to measure bandwidth consumption and latency impacts.

Result: The study found that post-quantum cryptographic algorithms cause minor performance overhead, but the computational and bandwidth increase are negligible, leaving network usability and efficiency largely unaffected.

Conclusion: Post-quantum cryptographic solutions can be successfully integrated into 5G Core systems without substantial impact on its performance or functionality, confirming previous research findings.

Abstract: In this work, the conventional cryptographic algorithms used in the 5G Core are replaced with post-quantum alternatives and the practical impact of this transition is evaluated. Using a simulation environment, we model the registration and deregistration of varying numbers of user equipments (UEs) and measure the resulting effects on bandwidth consumption and latency.
  Our results show that the deployment of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms has a measurable effect on performance, but that this effect is small, and perhaps more crucially, that the extra overhead needed in terms of computation and bandwidth does not have any substantial impact on the usability of the network and the efficiency of its network functions.
  Overall the experimental results in this work corroborate earlier research: the 5G Core is technically able to support post-quantum cryptography without any inherent issues connected to the increased computational overhead or larger message size.

Motivation: To provide a scalable, modular, and sound method for generating security specifications that aid in code analysis and secure software reuse.

Method: Developed Symmaries, a tool that automatically creates method summaries encompassing conditions for secure invocation, information flow, and aliasing updates for Java bytecode programs.

Result: Symmaries successfully analyzed Java API libraries and large real-world applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code while proving scalability and achieving significant precision based on heap models.

Conclusion: Symmaries enables scalable formal security specification generation, aiding static analysis tools and developers in ensuring secure software behavior, with soundness guaranteed for termination-insensitive non-interference.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, modular, and sound approach for automatically constructing formal security specifications for Java bytecode programs in the form of method summaries. A summary provides an abstract representation of a method's security behavior, consisting of the conditions under which the method can be securely invoked, together with specifications of information flows and aliasing updates. Such summaries can be consumed by static code analysis tools and also help developers understand the behavior of code segments, such as libraries, in order to evaluate their security implications when reused in applications. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Symmaries, which automates the generation of security summaries. We applied Symmaries to Java API libraries to extract their security specifications and to large real-world applications to evaluate its scalability. Our results show that the tool successfully scales to analyze applications with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and that Symmaries achieves a promising precision depending on the heap model used. We prove the soundness of our approach in terms of guaranteeing termination-insensitive non-interference.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach, \BAC, to detect Broken Access Control (BAC) violations by generating and analyzing API traffic data. It addresses challenges like lack of training data and the complex nature of BAC attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in detecting BAC violations effectively, especially due to limited training data and the complex nature of BAC attacks which often consist of correlated access requests that seem normal individually.

Method: To tackle these challenges, the authors propose \BAC, which comprises an API Traffic Generator and a BAC Detector. This approach synthesizes training data and improves the detection capabilities for BAC violations.

Result: The \BAC framework demonstrated significant improvement in its performance metrics, with an increase of 21.2% in F1 score and 24.1% in MCC, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This innovative approach proves to be more effective in detecting BAC violations than existing methods, addressing key challenges and showcasing improvements in performance metrics.

Abstract: Broken Access Control (BAC) violations, which consistently rank among the top five security risks in the OWASP API Security Top 10, refer to unauthorized access attempts arising from BAC vulnerabilities, whose successful exploitation can impose significant risks on exposed application programming interfaces (APIs). In recent years, learning-based methods have demonstrated promising prospects in detecting various types of malicious activities. However, in real-network operation and maintenance scenarios, leveraging learning-based methods for BAC detection faces two critical challenges. Firstly, under the RESTful API design principles, most systems omit recording composite traffic for performance, and together with ethical and legal bans on directly testing real-world systems, this leads to a critical shortage of training data for detecting BAC violations. Secondly, common malicious behaviors such as SQL injection typically generate individual access traffic that is inherently anomalous. In contrast, BAC is usually composed of multiple correlated access requests that appear normal when examined in isolation. To tackle these problems, we introduce \BAC, an approach for establishing a BAC violation detection model by generating and utilizing API traffic data. The \BAC consists of an API Traffic Generator and a BAC Detector. Experimental results show that \BAC outperforms current state-of-the-art invariant-based and learning-based methods with the $\text{F}_1$ and MCC improving by 21.2\% and 24.1\%.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study focuses on Android malware detection using graph-based methods and addresses vulnerabilities in these models. It introduces Graph Neural Network classifiers that achieve high accuracy and a GAN-based attack algorithm, VGAE-MalGAN, which exposes weaknesses and proposes retraining for improved robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting malicious Android applications is critical due to their widespread use, especially within IoT environments. However, graph-based deep learning methods need further investigation to enhance their reliability and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

Method: The study uses Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based classifiers for malware detection by creating graph embeddings combined with permission and intention features. Additionally, it proposes a GAN-based attack called VGAE-MalGAN to produce adversarial API graphs and expose vulnerabilities in GNN classifiers.

Result: The classification approach delivers high accuracy (98.33% on CICMaldroid and 98.68% on Drebin datasets). VGAE-MalGAN demonstrates success in reducing the detection rates of GNN classifiers through adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: While graph-based classifiers are effective for malware detection, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Retraining with adversarial samples strengthens the model's robustness against such threats.

Abstract: Since the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely adopted using Android applications, detecting malicious Android apps is essential. In recent years, Android graph-based deep learning research has proposed many approaches to extract relationships from applications as graphs to generate graph embeddings. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based classifier to generate API graph embeddings. The graph embeddings are combined with Permission and Intent features to train multiple machine learning and deep learning models for Android malware detection. The proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of 98.33 percent on the CICMaldroid dataset and 98.68 percent on the Drebin dataset. However, graph-based deep learning models are vulnerable, as attackers can add fake relationships to evade detection by the classifier. Second, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based attack algorithm named VGAE-MalGAN targeting graph-based GNN Android malware classifiers. The VGAE-MalGAN generator produces adversarial malware API graphs, while the VGAE-MalGAN substitute detector attempts to mimic the target detector. Experimental results show that VGAE-MalGAN can significantly reduce the detection rate of GNN-based malware classifiers. Although the model initially fails to detect adversarial malware, retraining with generated adversarial samples improves robustness and helps mitigate adversarial attacks.

*Sangryu Park,Gihyuk Ko,Homook Cho*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores using locally deployable small LLMs for software vulnerability analysis, identifying precise weaknesses via CWE instead of binary classification, achieving a cost-effective and secure solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for a practical, secure, and detailed approach to software vulnerability analysis that reduces dependencies on online API-based LLMs and moves beyond simplistic binary classification.

Method: The paper introduces the Software Vulnerability Identification (SVI) framework, where LLMs output CWE IDs for vulnerabilities, and demonstrates that locally deployable LLMs with instruction-tuning outperform API-based LLMs.

Result: Instruct-tuned local models showed superior performance in identification accuracy and cost efficiency compared to API-based LLMs, suggesting a practical alternative for vulnerability workflows.

Conclusion: Instruct-tuned local LLMs offer a secure, more precise, and cost-effective solution for software vulnerability management, making them practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating software vulnerability analysis, a critical task given the impact of security failure of modern software systems. However, current approaches in using LLMs to automate vulnerability analysis mostly rely on using online API-based LLM services, requiring the user to disclose the source code in development. Moreover, they predominantly frame the task as a binary classification(vulnerable or not vulnerable), limiting potential practical utility. This paper addresses these limitations by reformulating the problem as Software Vulnerability Identification (SVI), where LLMs are asked to output the type of weakness in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs rather than simply indicating the presence or absence of a vulnerability. We also tackle the reliance on large, API-based LLMs by demonstrating that instruction-tuning smaller, locally deployable LLMs can achieve superior identification performance. In our analysis, instruct-tuning a local LLM showed better overall performance and cost trade-off than online API-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that instruct-tuned local models represent a more effective, secure, and practical approach for leveraging LLMs in real-world vulnerability management workflows.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Odysseus, a novel method to exploit vulnerabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by embedding malicious content within images, achieving high attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the hidden security vulnerabilities in MLLM-integrated systems, especially concerning their reliance on safety filters that incorrectly assume malicious content is explicitly visible.

Method: The researchers developed "Odysseus," a jailbreak technique that employs dual steganography to stealthily embed harmful queries and outputs into seemingly innocuous images.

Result: Odysseus demonstrated a 99% attack success rate across multiple experiments on benchmark datasets, successfully exposing weaknesses in several MLLM-integrated systems.

Conclusion: The study challenges existing defenses in MLLM-integrated systems and recommends reconsidering security strategies, especially for cross-modal frameworks.

Abstract: By integrating language understanding with perceptual modalities such as images, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) constitute a critical substrate for modern AI systems, particularly intelligent agents operating in open and interactive environments. However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems.

Method: Introduced an end-to-end containerized pipeline that generates configurable DoH exfiltration samples, reconstructs files, extracts features, and trains detection models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) using a public dataset. It benchmarks models against evasive scenarios, encapsulated within Docker containers for reproducibility.

Result: Machine learning models were trained and compared against threshold-based methods under evasive scenarios. The toolkit showed the ability to orchestrate traffic generation, model training, and analysis for realistic evaluation.

Conclusion: The toolkit proves effective for studying and benchmarking DoH exfiltration detection. Future work will test its applicability with mixed traffic, expand protocol support, and explore whether stealth constraints can deter attackers.

Abstract: The purpose of this project is to assess how well defenders can detect DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) file exfiltration, and which evasion strategies can be used by attackers. While providing a reproducible toolkit to generate, intercept and analyze DoH exfiltration, and comparing Machine Learning vs threshold-based detection under adversarial scenarios. The originality of this project is the introduction of an end-to-end, containerized pipeline that generates configurable file exfiltration over DoH using several parameters (e.g., chunking, encoding, padding, resolver rotation). It allows for file reconstruction at the resolver side, while extracting flow-level features using a fork of DoHLyzer. The pipeline contains a prediction side, which allows the training of machine learning models based on public labelled datasets and then evaluates them side-by-side with threshold-based detection methods against malicious and evasive DNS-Over-HTTPS traffic. We train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression classifiers on a public DoH dataset and benchmark them against evasive DoH exfiltration scenarios. The toolkit orchestrates traffic generation, file capture, feature extraction, model training and analysis. The toolkit is then encapsulated into several Docker containers for easy setup and full reproducibility regardless of the platform it is run on. Future research regarding this project is directed at validating the results on mixed enterprise traffic, extending the protocol coverage to HTTP/3/QUIC request, adding a benign traffic generation, and working on real-time traffic evaluation. A key objective is to quantify when stealth constraints make DoH exfiltration uneconomical and unworthy for the attacker.

*Suguru Shiratori,Elham Kiyani,Khemraj Shukla,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper introduces GIMLET, a framework employing neural networks to discover thermodynamically consistent constitutive relations in fluid flow and scalar transport models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer unknown closure terms in governing equations with a gray-box approach, ensuring physical interpretability and thermodynamic consistency.

Method: The formulation uses neural networks to parameterize free-energy and dissipation functionals. Functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation, avoiding reliance on pre-defined candidate function libraries.

Result: The new method guarantees thermodynamic consistency, including monotonic free-energy decay and non-negative entropy production, and shows success on benchmark systems, including Burgers, Kuramoto--Sivashinsky, and Navier--Stokes equations.

Conclusion: GIMLET provides a generalizable and interpretable model discovery approach, facilitating transfer across datasets and offering physical insights into the dynamics.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for discovering constitutive relations in models of fluid flow and scalar transport. Our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations (gray-box discovery) under the assumption that the temporal derivative, convective transport, and pressure-gradient contributions are known. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from nonequilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, ensuring monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.

*Sebastian Racedo,Brigitte Jaumard,Oscar Delgado,Meysam Masoudi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning approach for O-RAN, leveraging a Graph Neural Network-assisted Deep Reinforcement Learning model (GRLDyP) to optimize energy consumption and maintain QoS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses inefficiencies in legacy RAN systems caused by static bindings between logical functions and physical locations, limiting their efficiency in dynamic traffic and resource conditions.

Method: The authors formalized the dynamic provisioning problem as a Markov decision process and developed GRLDyP, which integrates a graph neural network to model network topology and DRL to optimize routes and O-CU (O-RAN Central Unit) locations.

Result: GRLDyP reduced energy consumption while maintaining QoS during experiments using a 24-hour traffic dataset from Montreal, outperforming static mapping baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that DRL-based dynamic SFC provisioning is a practical and effective method for adaptive and energy-efficient O-RAN deployments.

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O RAN) disaggregates conventional RAN into interoperable components, enabling flexible resource allocation, energy savings, and agile architectural design. In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments.

Motivation: Traditional fault diagnosis methods struggle in complex modern telecommunication environments, leading to the need for automated and efficient solutions.

Method: The authors injected intentional faults into a Kubernetes-based network, collected logs and diagnostic data, and fine-tuned GPT-4.1 nano on this dataset for enhanced fault detection.

Result: Fine-tuned GPT-4.1 nano showed improved accuracy in detecting and classifying faults compared to the base model.

Conclusion: LLM-based methods can achieve automated fault management, reduce operator dependence, enhance network reliability, and lower operational downtime costs.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of data volume in modern telecommunication networks and the continuous expansion of their scale, maintaining high reliability has become a critical requirement. These networks support a wide range of applications and services, including highly sensitive and mission-critical ones, which demand rapid and accurate detection and resolution of network errors. Traditional fault-diagnosis methods are no longer efficient for such complex environments.\cite{b1} In this study, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate network fault detection and classification. Various types of network errors were intentionally injected into a Kubernetes-based test network, and data were collected under both healthy and faulty conditions. The dataset includes logs from different network components (pods), along with complementary data such as system descriptions, events, Round Trip Time (RTT) tests, and pod status information. The dataset covers common fault types such as pod failure, pod kill, network delay, network loss, and disk I/O failures. We fine-tuned the GPT-4.1 nano model via its API on this dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in fault-detection accuracy compared to the base model. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches for achieving closed-loop, and operator-free fault management, which can enhance network reliability and reduce downtime-related operational costs for service providers.

*İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya,Sajad Khodadadian,Taylan G. Topçu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper presents an RL-based intelligent mission coordinator using DE and MDP, showcasing its application in aerial firefighting and its superiority over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As missions transition from monolithic systems to complex systems of systems, static architectures prove inadequate for dynamic and uncertain mission environments, necessitating adaptive and analytically rigorous approaches.

Method: The paper integrates high-fidelity digital mission models with RL through Proximal Policy Optimization, formulating mission tactics management as an MDP and employing agent-based simulation.

Result: The proposed RL-based mission coordinator demonstrated superior performance and reduced variability in mission outcomes in an aerial firefighting case study.

Conclusion: This study validates DE and RL-based methodology as a robust, mission-agnostic framework for ME, with potential for broader applications in fleet design and mission planning.

Abstract: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust method for recovering action parameters in complex lattice field theories, including realistic cases such as quantum chromodynamics.

Method: The approach centers on minimizing a convex loss function derived from Schwinger-Dyson relations; extends this method to gauge theories and dynamical fermion models.

Result: Demonstrates that the existing score matching method is a specific case of the broader framework introduced in the study.

Conclusion: The proposed general method is valid for a wide range of lattice field theories, notably including challenging scenarios like quantum chromodynamics.

Abstract: We introduce a learning method for recovering action parameters in lattice field theories. Our method is based on the minimization of a convex loss function constructed using the Schwinger-Dyson relations. We show that score matching, a popular learning method, is a special case of our construction of an infinite family of valid loss functions. Importantly, our general Schwinger-Dyson-based construction applies to gauge theories and models with Grassmann-valued fields used to represent dynamical fermions. In particular, we extend our method to realistic lattice field theories including quantum chromodynamics.

### [297] [Optimal Anytime-Valid Tests for Composite Nulls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20039)
*Shubhanshu Shekhar*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper discusses optimal level-$α$ power-one tests for composite nulls, leveraging advanced statistical techniques and proposes methods to match theoretical lower bounds as $α$ approaches zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the design of statistical tests that are both theoretically optimal and practically reliable for composite null hypothesis testing, especially as the significance level $α$ becomes very small.

Method: The approach uses universal $e$-processes derived from saddle-point representations of minimum divergence measures and applies them to create tests applicable for both finite and general $$ domains.

Result: The paper establishes the optimality of these test constructions for finite-alphabet cases and compact convex nulls, demonstrating their validity and efficiency in selected applications.

Conclusion: The proposed methods not only achieve the theoretical lower bounds in terms of efficiency but also offer practical guidelines for implementation in diverse settings.

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing optimal level-$α$ power-one tests for composite nulls. Given a parameter $α\in (0,1)$ and a stream of $\mathcal{X}$-valued observations $\{X_n: n \geq 1\} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} P$, the goal is to design a level-$α$ power-one test $τ_α$ for the null $H_0: P \in \mathcal{P}_0 \subset \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$. Prior works have shown that any such $τ_α$ must satisfy $\mathbb{E}_P[τ_α] \geq \tfrac{\log(1/α)}{γ^*(P, \mathcal{P}_0)}$, where $γ^*(P, \mathcal{P}_0)$ is the so-called $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ or minimum divergence of $P$ to the null class. In this paper, our objective is to develop and analyze constructive schemes that match this lower bound as $α\downarrow 0$.
  We first consider the finite-alphabet case~($|\mathcal{X}| = m < \infty$), and show that a test based on \emph{universal} $e$-process~(formed by the ratio of a universal predictor and the running null MLE) is optimal in the above sense. The proof relies on a Donsker-Varadhan~(DV) based saddle-point representation of $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$, and an application of Sion's minimax theorem. This characterization motivates a general method for arbitrary $\mathcal{X}$: construct an $e$-process based on the empirical solutions to the saddle-point representation over a sufficiently rich class of test functions. We give sufficient conditions for the optimality of this test for compact convex nulls, and verify them for Hölder smooth density models. We end the paper with a discussion on the computational aspects of implementing our proposed tests in some practical settings.

*Dianjun Lin,Bing Li,Lingzhou Xue*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces two nonlinear dimension reduction methods for tensor-valued predictors using Tucker and CP decompositions, reducing model complexity and improving estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the need for preserving tensor structure in dimensional reduction while improving model parsimony and estimation accuracy.

Method: The methods are based on Tucker decomposition and CP-decomposition for reducing the dimensions of tensors, using sequences of least-squares steps and singular value decompositions respectively.

Result: The paper demonstrates the consistency and convergence rates of the methods, along with their improved finite-sample performance in simulations and applications.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform existing approaches, offering a more accurate, interpretable, and computationally efficient solution for tensor-valued data regressions.

Abstract: We introduce two nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction methods for regressions with tensor-valued predictors. Our goal is two-fold: the first is to preserve the tensor structure when performing dimension reduction, particularly the meaning of the tensor modes, for improved interpretation; the second is to substantially reduce the number of parameters in dimension reduction, thereby achieving model parsimony and enhancing estimation accuracy. Our two tensor dimension reduction methods echo the two commonly used tensor decomposition mechanisms: one is the Tucker decomposition, which reduces a larger tensor to a smaller one; the other is the CP-decomposition, which represents an arbitrary tensor as a sequence of rank-one tensors. We developed the Fisher consistency of our methods at the population level and established their consistency and convergence rates. Both methods are easy to implement numerically: the Tucker-form can be implemented through a sequence of least-squares steps, and the CP-form can be implemented through a sequence of singular value decompositions. We investigated the finite-sample performance of our methods and showed substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods in simulations and two data applications.

### [299] [Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection for Cardinality-Constrained Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19986)
*Nikolaos Iliopoulos*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CASP (Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection), improving cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization through a novel repair operator aligning with covariance structures, outperforming standard methods in portfolio variance and realized performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional repair operators used in portfolio optimization ignore covariance structures, leading to portfolios with higher risk. This paper seeks to address the issue with a repair operator designed to account for the covariance-driven risks.

Method: The CASP method utilizes a two-stage repair process: (i) selecting assets based on volatility-normalized scores, and (ii) adjusting weights using a covariance-aware geometry tied to tracking-error risk.

Result: CASP achieves significantly lower portfolio variance compared to standard Euclidean methods, demonstrating robust improvements across diverse assets and statistical significance. Optional extensions further enhance Sharpe ratios and realized performance.

Conclusion: CASP outperforms traditional repair operators by integrating covariance-awareness directly into portfolio optimization workflows. It serves as a practical, robust solution for more efficient risk management and optimization.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms for cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization require repair operators to map infeasible candidates onto the feasible region. Standard Euclidean projection treats assets as independent and can ignore the covariance structure that governs portfolio risk, potentially producing less diversified portfolios. This paper introduces Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection (CASP), a two-stage repair operator that (i) selects a target number of assets using volatility-normalized scores and (ii) projects the candidate weights using a covariance-aware geometry aligned with tracking-error risk. This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance. CASP integrates as a drop-in replacement for Euclidean projection in metaheuristic portfolio optimizers.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the subjectivity in bowel cleanliness evaluation during colonoscopy by proposing an automated scoring system using advanced AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual assessment of bowel cleanliness using BBPS scores is subjective and inconsistent, which can affect colonoscopy quality.

Method: A novel automated framework combining the CLIP model with transfer learning and fecal-feature extraction was developed. It integrates visual and textual features for accurate scoring.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing baselines, validated through experiments on a proprietary and public dataset.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates high potential for improving clinical bowel cleanliness assessment in colonoscopy practice.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually. In this paper, to support robust training and evaluation, we construct a high-quality colonoscopy dataset comprising 2,240 images from 517 subjects, annotated with expert-agreed BBPS scores. We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for clinical decision-making and outcome assessment. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance.
  In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs. To incorporate spatial context, adjacent slice information is integrated using a three-slice input configuration.
  All models are trained under a unified framework and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results show that transformer-based models outperform convolutional baselines, and the proposed dual-encoder TransUNet achieves the best performance, reaching a Dice score of 85.4% on the test set. The proposed framework offers a robust solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI.

TL;DR: A method combining unsupervised learning and artificial neural networks is proposed for predicting monomer reactivity ratios, improving efficiency over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of traditional and computational methods in determining monomer reactivity ratios for copolymers.

Method: Spectral clustering was used to group monomers by reactivity patterns, paired with neural networks for prediction using two integration strategies.

Result: Distinct monomer groups and interaction patterns were identified, while neural networks enhanced quantitative predictions, balancing specificity and data availability.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning facilitates rapid analysis and supervised learning ensures accurate design predictions, with strategies varying by data and application needs.

Abstract: Predicting monomer reactivity ratios is crucial for controlling monomer sequence distribution in copolymers and their properties. Traditional experimental methods of determining reactivity ratios are time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing computational methods often struggle with accuracy or scalability. Here, we present a method that combines unsupervised learning with artificial neural networks to predict reactivity ratios in radical copolymerization. By applying spectral clustering to physicochemical features of monomers, we identified three distinct monomer groups with characteristic reactivity patterns. This computationally efficient clustering approach revealed specific monomer group interactions leading to different sequence arrangements, including alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers, providing chemical insights for initial exploration. Building upon these insights, we trained artificial neural networks to achieve quantitative reactivity ratio predictions. We explored two integration strategies including direct feature concatenation, and cluster-specific training, which demonstrated performance enhancements for targeted chemical domains compared to general training with equivalent sample sizes. However, models utilizing complete datasets outperformed specialized models trained on focused subsets, revealing a fundamental trade-off between chemical specificity and data availability. This work demonstrates that unsupervised learning offers rapid chemical insight for exploratory analysis, while supervised learning provides the accuracy necessary for final design predictions, with optimal strategies depending on data availability and application requirements.

Conclusion: NMIRacle demonstrates the potential of AI-based approaches in simplifying and improving the process of molecular structure elucidation, making it more efficient and precise.

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectroscopic data is a long-standing challenge in Chemistry, traditionally requiring expert interpretation. We introduce NMIRacle, a two-stage generative framework that builds upon recent paradigms in AI-driven spectroscopy with minimal assumptions. In the first stage, NMIRacle learns to reconstruct molecular structures from count-aware fragment encodings, which capture both fragment identities and their occurrences. In the second stage, a spectral encoder maps input spectroscopic measurements (IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR) into a latent embedding that conditions the pre-trained generator. This formulation bridges fragment-level chemical modeling with spectral evidence, yielding accurate molecular predictions. Empirical results show that NMIRacle outperforms existing baselines on molecular elucidation, while maintaining robust performance across increasing levels of molecular complexity.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly used across diverse domains, including logistics, agriculture, surveillance, and defense. While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns.

Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51 percent and 97.11 percent accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework's potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited.

Method: The authors propose a DS-HGCN model that uses hypergraph structures incorporating multi-dimensional features and a hypergraph attention mechanism to consider social contagion and individual differences between students.

Result: Their model achieves superior performance in predicting student engagement compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach highlights the importance of modeling social and multi-dimensional features for understanding and predicting student engagement effectively.

Abstract: Student engagement is a critical factor influencing academic success and learning outcomes. Accurately predicting student engagement is essential for optimizing teaching strategies and providing personalized interventions. However, most approaches focus on single-dimensional feature analysis and assessing engagement based on individual student factors. In this work, we propose a dual-stream multi-feature fusion model based on hypergraph convolutional networks (DS-HGCN), incorporating social contagion of student engagement. DS-HGCN enables accurate prediction of student engagement states by modeling multi-dimensional features and their propagation mechanisms between students. The framework constructs a hypergraph structure to encode engagement contagion among students and captures the emotional and behavioral differences and commonalities by multi-frequency signals. Furthermore, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the influence of each student, accounting for individual differences in the propagation process. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

### [306] [Learned Digital Codes for Over-the-Air Computation in Federated Edge Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19777)
*Antonio Tarizzo,Mohammad Kazemi,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for digital over-the-air (OTA) aggregation in federated edge learning (FEEL) to improve model convergence and SNR robustness through end-to-end learned decoders, incorporating codebook design and AMP-style methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital OTA schemes suffer from limited performance in low SNR regimes, which restricts their application in FEEL settings with heterogeneous and larger-scale devices. Enhanced methods are needed to improve recovery accuracy and robustness while maintaining uplink overhead.

Method: The proposed approach integrates a URA codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an end-to-end system that jointly trains the codebook, decoder, and local training statistics. It extends the functionality beyond averaging to various symmetric functions like trimmed means and majority rules.

Result: The framework achieves over a 10 dB improvement in low SNR environments and demonstrates reliable performance across all SNR ranges, even under conditions like message corruption and nonlinear aggregation.

Conclusion: This learned digital OTA framework significantly enhances robustness and accuracy in FEEL scenarios, demonstrating the potential of end-to-end learning-based designs for scalable and efficient wireless aggregation.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables wireless devices to collaboratively train a centralised model without sharing raw data, but repeated uplink transmission of model updates makes communication the dominant bottleneck. Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL.

### [307] [Information-theoretic signatures of causality in Bayesian networks and hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20552)
*Sung En Chiang,Zhaolu Liu,Robert L. Peach,Mauricio Barahona*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical connection between Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and causal structures, showing its effectiveness in identifying causal relationships and offering a model-agnostic framework for pairwise and higher-order causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the mathematical link between higher-order information-theoretic measures like PID and causal structures, and to develop tools for robust causal inference in multivariate systems.

Method: The paper constructs a theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structures in Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. It formalizes how PID components (redundant, unique, and synergistic information) characterize relationships in causal structures, and extends this framework for higher-order systems like hypergraphs.

Result: The study establishes that in Bayesian networks, unique information identifies direct causal neighbors, and synergy reveals collider relationships. For hypergraphs, PID signatures differentiate causal roles such as parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, introducing new insights into multi-tail hyperedges.

Conclusion: The authors position PID as a robust and local-model approach to infer both pairwise and higher-order causal structures, offering an alternative to traditional global graph-search methodologies.

Abstract: Analyzing causality in multivariate systems involves establishing how information is generated, distributed and combined, and thus requires tools that capture interactions beyond pairwise relations. Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery.

### [309] [Making Large Language Models Efficient Dense Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20612)
*Yibin Lei,Shwai He,Ang Li,Andrew Yates*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EffiR framework is proposed to tackle computational inefficiency in LLM-based dense retrievers by applying a coarse-to-fine MLP compression strategy and retrieval-specific fine-tuning, achieving performance preservation and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of LLMs in dense retrieval tasks due to their large parameter sizes. Despite significant research on layer redundancy for generative tasks, there is a gap in understanding layer redundancy for retrieval tasks that require encoding sequences into fixed representations.

Method: The method involves analyzing layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers, identifying important layers, and developing EffiR. EffiR performs MLP compression using a coarse-to-fine approach (reducing depth, then width) followed by fine-tuning specific to retrieval tasks.

Result: EffiR achieves notable reductions in model size and inference costs while maintaining the performance of full-size LLM-based dense retrievers across a wide range of datasets and model backbones.

Conclusion: EffiR demonstrates that targeted compression of MLP layers and retrieval-specific fine-tuning can effectively address the inefficiency of LLM-based dense retrievers without compromising performance, establishing a new standard for efficient retrieval model design.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that directly fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for dense retrieval yields strong performance, but their substantial parameter counts make them computationally inefficient. While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it remains unclear whether similar redundancy exists when these models are adapted for retrieval tasks, which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than generating tokens iteratively. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers. We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning. Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores how AI and human expert partnerships can enhance performance in healthcare, specifically in MRI-based brain tumor diagnosis. It finds that AI-human collaboration improves accuracy, confidence, and consistency for both parties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the dual dynamics of human-AI collaboration in healthcare and understand how these partnerships can enhance clinical decision-making.

Method: The study investigates the interaction of radiologists and AI systems in MRI-guided characterization of brain tumors, assessing performance in various collaborative setups.

Result: Human-AI collaboration significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy, metacognitive skills, and agreement consistency for both radiologists and AI systems. The highest patient benefits were observed when AI was supported by human expertise.

Conclusion: AI is most effective in healthcare when it amplifies human intelligence rather than replacing it, showcasing synergetic improvements in performance for both humans and AI agents.

Abstract: The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) human partnerships-evaluating how AI agents enhance expert human performance-are increasingly studied. Though rarely evaluated in healthcare, an inverse approach is possible: AI benefiting from the support of an expert human agent. Here, we investigate both human-AI clinical partnership paradigms in the magnetic resonance imaging-guided characterisation of patients with brain tumours. We reveal that human-AI partnerships improve accuracy and metacognitive ability not only for radiologists supported by AI, but also for AI agents supported by radiologists. Moreover, the greatest patient benefit was evident with an AI agent supported by a human one. Synergistic improvements in agent accuracy, metacognitive performance, and inter-rater agreement suggest that AI can create more capable, confident, and consistent clinical agents, whether human or model-based. Our work suggests that the maximal value of AI in healthcare could emerge not from replacing human intelligence, but from AI agents that routinely leverage and amplify it.

*Cyrus Vachha,Yixiao Kang,Zach Dive,Ashwat Chidambaram,Anik Gupta,Eunice Jun,Bjoern Hartmann*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dreamcrafter, a VR-based system combing immersive 3D scene editing with generative AI for real-time, intuitive interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene editing either rely on immersive direct manipulation or utilize AI-driven techniques for higher-level abstraction edits, yet both approaches have limitations such as high latency and lack of user-friendly integration.

Method: The authors designed Dreamcrafter, a modular VR-based system allowing users to integrate generative AI algorithms, providing control via natural language, direct manipulation, and proxy representations to handle latency.

Result: Dreamcrafter supports real-time interaction and offers user-friendly tools to apply generative AI to 3D scene editing, along with insights on user control preferences and creativity enhancement.

Conclusion: Generative AI combined with immersive interfaces can significantly improve the usability and creativity potential in 3D scene editing. The Dreamcrafter system bridges high-level AI tools and real-time engagement for world-building tasks.

Abstract: Authoring 3D scenes is a central task for spatial computing applications. Competing visions for lowering existing barriers are (1) focus on immersive, direct manipulation of 3D content or (2) leverage AI techniques that capture real scenes (3D Radiance Fields such as, NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) and modify them at a higher level of abstraction, at the cost of high latency. We unify the complementary strengths of these approaches and investigate how to integrate generative AI advances into real-time, immersive 3D Radiance Field editing. We introduce Dreamcrafter, a VR-based 3D scene editing system that: (1) provides a modular architecture to integrate generative AI algorithms; (2) combines different levels of control for creating objects, including natural language and direct manipulation; and (3) introduces proxy representations that support interaction during high-latency operations. We contribute empirical findings on control preferences and discuss how generative AI interfaces beyond text input enhance creativity in scene editing and world building.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAM Audio, a universal model for separating audio sources, integrating text, visual, and time prompts into one framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current audio separation models which are mostly domain-specific and support a single prompting modality, aiming to create a more versatile and general solution.

Method: SAM Audio relies on a diffusion transformer architecture trained with flow matching using large-scale, diverse audio data while supporting flexible prompts including text, visual, and temporal inputs.

Result: SAM Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of benchmarks on general, speech, and musical audio separation, significantly outperforming prior systems.

Conclusion: The model serves as a foundational tool for multimodal AI achieving excellence in audio separation and introduces a new benchmark for real-world use cases with multimodal prompts.

Abstract: General audio source separation is a key capability for multimodal AI systems that can perceive and reason about sound. Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only a single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, a foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and a reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in current Audio-Text Retrieval (ATR) methods due to Gradient Locality Bottleneck (GLB) and Representation-Drift Mismatch (RDM), introducing the Adaptive Self-improving Knowledge (ASK) framework to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in ATR caused by the Gradient Locality Bottleneck (GLB) and Representation-Drift Mismatch (RDM), which prevent effective fine-grained, long-tail learning and lead to static knowledge misalignment with evolving models.

Method: Proposes the ASK framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution that tackles GLB with multi-grained knowledge injection, mitigates RDM through dynamic knowledge refinement, and employs an adaptive reliability weighting scheme.

Result: Experimental evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the ASK framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The ASK framework successfully addresses critical limitations in ATR methods, providing a robust, adaptive solution that improves fine-grained learning and ensures consistent knowledge optimization.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for Audio-Text Retrieval (ATR) relies on mini-batch-based contrastive learning. This process, however, is inherently limited by what we formalize as the Gradient Locality Bottleneck (GLB), which structurally prevents models from leveraging out-of-batch knowledge and thus impairs fine-grained and long-tail learning. While external knowledge-enhanced methods can alleviate the GLB, we identify a critical, unaddressed side effect: the Representation-Drift Mismatch (RDM), where a static knowledge base becomes progressively misaligned with the evolving model, turning guidance into noise. To address this dual challenge, we propose the Adaptive Self-improving Knowledge (ASK) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution. ASK breaks the GLB via multi-grained knowledge injection, systematically mitigates RDM through dynamic knowledge refinement, and introduces a novel adaptive reliability weighting scheme to ensure consistent knowledge contributes to optimization. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with superior, state-of-the-art performance justify the efficacy of our proposed ASK framework.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Deep Eigenspace Network (DEN) to solve parametric non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problems efficiently by learning eigensubspace mappings instead of individual eigenfunctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address issues caused by spectral instability and mode switching in non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problems, which are challenging to solve efficiently.

Method: The methodology incorporates a hybrid framework using DEN, which combines Fourier Neural Operators, geometry-adaptive POD bases, and explicit banded cross-mode mixing to handle unstructured meshes and complex dependencies.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate that DEN achieves high accuracy and generalizes well to unseen discretizations (zero-shot generalization). Additionally, proofs for Lipschitz continuity and reconstruction error bounds of the eigensubspace are provided.

Conclusion: The proposed DEN offers an effective solution for parametric non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problems with robust accuracy and generalization by focusing on stable eigensubspace mappings over individual eigenfunctions.

Abstract: We consider operator learning for efficiently solving parametric non-selfadjoint eigenvalue problems. To overcome the spectral instability and mode switching inherent in non-selfadjoint operators, we introduce a hybrid framework that learns the stable invariant eigensubspace mapping rather than individual eigenfunctions. We proposed a Deep Eigenspace Network (DEN) architecture integrating Fourier Neural Operators, geometry-adaptive POD bases, and explicit banded cross-mode mixing mechanisms to capture complex spectral dependencies on unstructured meshes. We apply DEN to the parametric non-selfadjoint Steklov eigenvalue problem and provide theoretical proofs for the Lipschitz continuity of the eigensubspace with respect to the parameters. In addition, we derive error bounds for the reconstruction of the eigenspace. Numerical experiments validate DEN's high accuracy and zero-shot generalization capabilities across different discretizations.

*Bohan Wu,Eli N. Weinstein,David M. Blei*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayesian empirical Bayes (BEB), a generalized approach to empirical Bayes, which extends classical EB methods to structured data settings using probabilistic symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations of classical EB methods in handling modern applications with complex structures like arrays, spatial processes, or covariates.

Method: The authors leverage probabilistic symmetry for deriving empirical Bayes methods, using ergodic decomposition, and develop algorithms utilizing variational inference and neural networks.

Result: BEB demonstrates performance improvements over existing methods in simulations and real-world applications, such as denoising cancer gene-expression data and spatial air-quality data.

Conclusion: BEB expands the applicability of empirical Bayes methods, offering scalable solutions for modern structured datasets while improving inference accuracy.

Abstract: Empirical Bayes (EB) improves the accuracy of simultaneous inference "by learning from the experience of others" (Efron, 2012). Classical EB theory focuses on latent variables that are iid draws from a fitted prior (Efron, 2019). Modern applications, however, feature complex structure, like arrays, spatial processes, or covariates. How can we apply EB ideas to these settings? We propose a generalized approach to empirical Bayes based on the notion of probabilistic symmetry. Our method pairs a simultaneous inference problem-with an unknown prior-to a symmetry assumption on the joint distribution of the latent variables. Each symmetry implies an ergodic decomposition, which we use to derive a corresponding empirical Bayes method. We call this methodBayesian empirical Bayes (BEB). We show how BEB recovers the classical methods of empirical Bayes, which implicitly assume exchangeability. We then use it to extend EB to other probabilistic symmetries: (i) EB matrix recovery for arrays and graphs; (ii) covariate-assisted EB for conditional data; (iii) EB spatial regression under shift invariance. We develop scalable algorithms based on variational inference and neural networks. In simulations, BEB outperforms existing approaches to denoising arrays and spatial data. On real data, we demonstrate BEB by denoising a cancer gene-expression matrix and analyzing spatial air-quality data from New York City.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This study introduces novel estimators for causal inference within a complex Napkin graph framework, proposing advanced methods validated through simulations and practical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, particularly in complex causal structures like the Napkin graph.

Method: Developed novel estimation methods including doubly robust one-step and targeted minimum loss-based estimators that utilize machine learning to handle nuisance functions.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate asymptotic efficiency and robustness, validated through simulations and applied to real-world data on educational attainment and income.

Conclusion: The Napkin graph framework improves causal inference by incorporating Verma constraints and leveraging advanced estimation methods, which are implemented in the napkincausal R package.

Abstract: Unmeasured confounding can render identification strategies based on adjustment functionals invalid. We study the "Napkin graph", a causal structure that encapsulates patterns of M-bias, instrumental variables, and the classical back-door and front-door models within a single graphical framework, yet requires a nonstandard identification strategy: the average treatment effect is expressed as a ratio of two g-formulas. We develop novel estimators for this functional, including doubly robust one-step and targeted minimum loss-based estimators that remain asymptotically linear when nuisance functions are estimated at slower-than-parametric rates using machine learning. We also show how a generalized independence restriction encoded by the Napkin graph, known as a Verma constraint, can be exploited to improve efficiency, illustrating more generally how such constraints in hidden variable DAGs can inform semiparametric inference. The proposed methods are validated through simulations and applied to the Finnish Life Course study to estimate the effect of educational attainment on income. An accompanying R package, napkincausal, implements all proposed procedures.
