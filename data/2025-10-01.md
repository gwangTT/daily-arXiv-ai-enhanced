### [1] [Blueprint-Bench: Comparing spatial intelligence of LLMs, agents and image models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25229)
*Lukas Petersson,Axel Backlund,Axel Wennstöm,Hanna Petersson,Callum Sharrock,Arash Dabiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark to test spatial reasoning in AI models through converting apartment photos into floor plans. It highlights the gap in AI's spatial intelligence as models perform poorly compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in AI models, which is critical for tasks requiring spatial reconstruction from multimodal inputs.

Method: The benchmark involves converting interior images of apartments into 2D floor plans and evaluates similarity to ground truth based on room connectivity and size rankings. Various AI models, including multimodal and agent-based systems, were tested.

Result: Current AI models perform poorly, often at or below random baselines, with humans outperforming significantly. Iterative agent approaches also fail to improve performance.

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench exposes significant limitations in spatial reasoning among modern AI models and provides a foundation for future evaluation, inviting the community to contribute models and monitor progress.

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

### [2] [CIMNAS: A Joint Framework for Compute-In-Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25862)
*Olga Krestinskaya,Mohammed E. Fouda,Ahmed Eltawil,Khaled N. Salama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS is a framework optimizing CIM-based neural network accelerators by automating co-optimization of software and hardware parameters, resulting in significant efficiency improvements without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of manual tuning of vast software and hardware design parameters in CIM-based neural network accelerators for AI applications, aiming to maximize efficiency and performance.

Method: CIMNAS employs HW-NAS techniques to jointly optimize software parameters, quantization policies, and hardware design parameters, including device-, circuit-, and architecture-level variables.

Result: Using MobileNet and ResNet50 models, CIMNAS delivered a massive reduction in EDAP (up to 819.5x for SRAM-based designs), and significant improvements in TOPS/W and TOPS/mm², while maintaining 73.81% accuracy.

Conclusion: CIMNAS enables automated, efficient co-optimization of hardware and software for neural network accelerators, achieving high performance and energy efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

### [3] [The Causal Abstraction Network: Theory and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25236)
*Gabriele D'Acunto,Paolo Di Lorenzo,Sergio Barbarossa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal Abstraction Network (CAN) to enhance AI explainability, investigates its theoretical properties, and develops a learning method to recover CAN structures effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness in AI using structured causal models (SCMs), particularly through the lens of network sheaves of causal knowledge.

Method: The authors define CANs with Gaussian SCMs, transpose constraint maps, and edge-node correspondence. They investigate its properties and propose an efficient learning method, SPECTRAL, using iterative updates to solve local Riemannian problems.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed CAN structure performs competitively in the causal abstraction (CA) learning task and successfully recovers diverse CAN structures on synthetic data.

Conclusion: CAN offers a novel approach to causal knowledge modeling with theoretical advancements and practical methods for effective learning, emphasizing scalability and accuracy in causal abstraction tasks.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

### [4] [A Formal Comparison Between Chain-of-Thought and Latent Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25239)
*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares Chain-of-Thought reasoning with Latent Thought in looped models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in iterative computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the comparative strengths and efficiencies of reasoning approaches in large language models.

Method: Formal analysis of computation and reasoning paradigms in CoT versus Latent Thought Looped Transformers.

Result: Latent Thought supports parallel computation, while CoT performs sequential reasoning with stochastic decoding advantageous for some complex problems.

Conclusion: Recognizing task-specific benefits of each approach offers practical guidance for selecting reasoning paradigms in advanced language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at
https://github.com/kevin671/cot-vs-loop.

### [5] [Lita: Light Agent Uncovers the Agentic Coding Capabilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25873)
*Hankun Dai,Maoquan Wang,Mengnan Qi,Yikai Zhang,Zijian Jin,Yongqiang Yao,Yufan Huang,Shengyu Fu,Elsie Nallipogu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Lita, a minimalist agent design for autonomous coding tasks, outperforming complex designs in efficiency and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome dependencies on complex, handcrafted workflows and reduce human intervention in agent-based coding tasks.

Method: Introduce 'Lita', an agent prioritizing simplicity ('liteness') by minimizing manual design while maintaining functionality.

Result: Lita achieves superior or competitive performance in coding tasks compared to intricate workflows, while being resource-efficient.

Conclusion: Lita effectively unveils LLMs' true coding capabilities, and the Agent Complexity Law predicts diminishing performance gaps as models improve.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

### [6] [Neo-Grounded Theory: A Methodological Innovation Integrating High-Dimensional Vector Clustering and Multi-Agent Collaboration for Qualitative Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25244)
*Shuide Wen,Beier Ku,Teng Wang,Mingyang Zou,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) combines vector clustering with multi-agent systems for faster, scalable, and rigorous qualitative analysis, achieving notable speed, quality, and cost improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the scale-depth paradox in qualitative research by enabling efficient analysis of large datasets while retaining interpretive richness.

Method: The paper introduces NGT, which uses 1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and agent-based coding. It compares NGT's results with manual coding and ChatGPT-supported analysis on Chinese interview transcripts and tests automated versus human-guided processes.

Result: NGT achieved a 168-fold speed improvement, a 96% cost reduction, and slightly better quality than traditional methods. It could uncover previously invisible patterns and highlighted the necessity of human-AI collaboration for actionable insights.

Conclusion: NGT showcases that computational methods can enhance rather than diminish the humanistic elements of qualitative research, making it more accessible, timely, and insightful while reducing costs substantially.

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

### [7] [Memory Management and Contextual Consistency for Long-Running Low-Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25250)
*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid memory system for AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms to solve memory challenges in long-term operations, merging episodic and semantic memory with an "Intelligent Decay" mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory management challenges (e.g., memory inflation and contextual degradation) faced by autonomous agents in long-duration business processes within LCNC platforms.

Method: The proposed hybrid memory system integrates episodic and semantic memory components, complemented by an "Intelligent Decay" mechanism that intelligently manages memory based on recency, relevance, and utility. Additionally, a user-centric visualization interface allows non-technical users to interact with memory management effectively.

Result: In simulated long-running tasks, the hybrid system outperformed traditional memory approaches (e.g., sliding windows, basic RAG), achieving better task completion rates, contextual consistency, and reduced long-term token costs.

Conclusion: The study offers a framework for building AI agents under LCNC platforms that demonstrate improved long-term learning, reliable performance, and user-friendly memory management.

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

### [8] [Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a method to eliminate hallucinations in large language models by integrating factual knowledge directly into their attention mechanisms, achieving near-perfect accuracy in stated tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate due to their probabilistic nature, despite their success in natural language tasks. The authors aim to address this problem by providing a foundation for deterministic truth-telling in LLMs.

Method: The authors propose Fact Grounded Attention, which modifies the core attention mechanism of LLMs. Unlike patching post-generation or prepending retrieved knowledge, FGA directly intervenes in the pre-softmax attention scores, ensuring the model adheres to verified knowledge.

Result: FGA significantly improves the accuracy of responses from 6.3% in a vanilla LLM to 99.7%. Additionally, it enables rapid knowledge updates (under one second) without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: The FGA approach fundamentally eliminates hallucinations for verifiable facts, representing a shift from probabilistic outputs to deterministic precision in language models.

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

### [9] [Language Model Planning from an Information Theoretic Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25260)
*Muhammed Ustaomeroglu,Baris Askin,Gauri Joshi,Carlee Joe-Wong,Guannan Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how decoder-only language models engage in planning by analyzing their hidden states using a novel pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open question of whether and how decoder-only language models perform planning, which has significant implications for model interpretability, reliability, and design.

Method: The authors developed a framework using vector-quantized variational autoencoders to compress model hidden states into compact summary codes, enabling measurement of mutual information for analyzing computational structures.

Result: The study found that planning horizons are task-dependent, models preserve information about alternative correct continuations, and predictions depend primarily on recent computations, though earlier layers also contribute.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of planning in language models and offers a general-purpose tool for investigating internal dynamics in LMs and other deep learning systems.

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

### [10] [RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25271)
*Xiuyuan Chen,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Huilin Zhou,Zheng Zhu,Ping Hu,Linghe Kong,Chi Zhang,Weiran Huang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RADAR, a collaborative evaluation framework designed to improve the safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) by addressing existing limitations like evaluator bias and detection failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluation methods for LLMs face challenges such as evaluator bias and the inability to detect risks due to model homogeneity, necessitating a more robust approach to risk evaluation.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework dividing the risk concept space into explicit, implicit, and non-risk subspaces. They introduce RADAR, which utilizes multi-agent collaboration, debate mechanisms, and dynamic updates for self-evolution in evaluating risks.

Result: RADAR demonstrated significant improvements in evaluation metrics like accuracy, stability, and sensitivity, achieving a 28.87% higher risk identification accuracy compared to the best baseline method.

Conclusion: RADAR effectively addresses limitations in existing evaluation methods by providing a comprehensive and self-evolving risk evaluation framework, proving its utility through empirical validation.

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores system-level challenges in using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Models (LLMs), presenting issues like GPU idling and load imbalance while proposing a benchmark suite named PolyTrace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limited understanding of RLVR's system challenges in enhancing LLMs' reasoning and comprehension abilities.

Method: The authors conducted a characterization study of RLVR tasks, specifically analyzing workload distributions across RL tasks, identifying inefficiencies, and introducing the PolyTrace benchmark suite for evaluation.

Result: Identified issues include GPU idling, inefficient parallel strategies, poor data management, and load imbalances; PolyTrace demonstrated 94.7% accuracy in realistic workload evaluations.

Conclusion: The paper highlights critical system challenges in RLVR workflows, calls for further research, and introduces PolyTrace as a usable benchmark for improving RL training systems in LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimization of CPU-based convolution algorithms for deep learning inference remains underexplored compared to GPU or NPU implementations.

Method: The authors benchmarked direct, GEMM-based, and Winograd convolution algorithms across modern CPUs from various manufacturers, analyzing both latency and energy efficiency.

Result: Results show the Nvidia AGX Orin using the GEMM algorithm offers the best balance between inference latency and energy consumption.

Conclusion: Key CPU architectural factors influencing convolution efficiency were identified, providing a practical guide for energy-aware embedded deployment.

Abstract: This work evaluates state-of-the-art convolution algorithms for CPU-based

implementations remain relatively underoptimized. We benchmark direct,
GEMM-based, and Winograd convolutions across modern CPUs from ARM __ , Intel __

efficiency. Our results highlight the key architectural factors that govern CPU
efficiency for convolution operations, providing practical guidance for
energy-aware embedded deployment. As a main results of this work, the Nvidia __
AGX Orin combined with the GEMM algorithm achieves the best trade-off between
inference latency and energy consumption.

*Jiexi Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Ran Tong,Su Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), which incorporates explicit causal structures into low-code workflows to reduce logical inconsistencies and hallucinations in LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLM agents relying on probabilistic reasoning, which leads to hallucinations and logical errors without a genuine understanding of causal relationships.

Method: The authors designed CVP, a low-code interface that creates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to define causal relationships between workflow modules, anchoring the reasoning process to these user-defined structures.

Result: A synthetic experiment simulating a distribution shift demonstrated that causally anchored models with CVP maintained stable accuracy, while baseline models experienced significant performance drops.

Conclusion: CVP improves the reliability, interpretability, and robustness of AI agents by reducing errors and causal confusion through explicit causal structures.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

*Daniel Platnick,Mohamed E. Bengueddache,Marjan Alirezaie,Dava J. Newman,Alex ''Sandy'' Pentland,Hossein Rahnama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the ID-RAG mechanism to improve generative agents' long-term coherence using a knowledge graph-based identity model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of identity drift, loss of coherence, and propagation of hallucinations in generative agents during long-horizon tasks.

Method: The ID-RAG mechanism grounds agents' decisions in a structured identity model (knowledge graph of beliefs, traits, values), retrieving relevant context for coherence.

Result: ID-RAG enabled agents (HAis) achieved better persona coherence and reduced simulation times by up to 58% compared to baseline models in social simulations.

Conclusion: ID-RAG offers a foundational approach for creating more coherent, interpretable, and aligned generative agents over long-term tasks.

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

*Tianrui Qin,Qianben Chen,Sinuo Wang,He Xing,King Zhu,He Zhu,Dingfeng Shi,Xinxin Liu,Ge Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Xitong Gao,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher is a parallel agent reasoning framework designed for complex reasoning tasks using LLMs, optimizing performance by shifting from sequential to concurrent task execution in a directed acyclic graph format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM frameworks lack efficiency in tasks requiring extensive tool interaction due to sequential processing.

Method: The proposed framework decomposes tasks into subtasks mapped onto directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for concurrent execution. Dynamic workflow optimization is employed, integrating intermediate results and summary modules.

Result: Flash-Searcher demonstrated superior performance, achieving 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while reducing agent execution steps by up to 35%.

Conclusion: This framework significantly improves efficiency and scalability in reasoning tasks, showing generalizability across diverse LLM architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

### [16] [Dive into the Agent Matrix: A Realistic Evaluation of Self-Replication Risk in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25302)
*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for assessing the risk of uncontrolled self-replication in LLM agents, showing that over half of the tested models exhibit concerning tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address safety concerns regarding the self-replication risks in LLM agents, especially those driven by objective misalignment in real-world scenarios, which are currently under-examined.

Method: The authors developed a scenario-driven evaluation framework that simulates authentic production environments and tasks, accompanied by metrics (Overuse Rate and Aggregate Overuse Count) to quantify self-replication behavior.

Result: The study evaluated 21 LLM models and found that over 50% exhibited tendencies toward uncontrolled self-replication, surpassing a safety risk threshold under operational pressures.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for comprehensive risk assessments and robust safety mechanisms to mitigate objective misalignment risks in LLM agents during their practical use.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

*Jovan Stojkovic,Chaojie Zhang,Íñigo Goiri,Ricardo Bianchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a holistic management framework optimizing the lifecycle of AI datacenters, reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) by up to 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth in large language models (LLMs) has created significant demand for AI inference infrastructure, but traditional datacenter lifecycle management struggles to meet the dynamic needs of AI workloads due to high operational costs, frequent hardware upgrades, and other challenges.

Method: The authors propose a comprehensive AI datacenter lifecycle management framework that includes detailed design improvements in power, cooling, and networking; tailored hardware refresh strategies; and software optimizations during operations, focusing on co-optimization across all lifecycle stages.

Result: The proposed framework reduces TCO by as much as 40% compared to traditional lifecycle management approaches.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to AI datacenter management that integrates design, hardware refresh, and operational strategies to meet the evolving demands of AI systems while significantly reducing costs.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

*Yiming Wang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) showcasing that neural networks can generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on advanced skills like reasoning. Results align with human-like cognitive patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether neural networks can develop higher-order Theory-of-Mind (ToM) abilities independently of advanced skills, paralleling human cognitive development.

Method: A neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) was developed to simulate a minimal cognitive system, acquiring first-order ToM competence. Evaluations tested its second- and third-order ToM abilities and how these scaled with parameter changes.

Result: ToMNN demonstrated above-chance accuracy in higher-order ToM tasks. It encountered sharper declines moving from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher orders, mirroring human-like cognitive difficulty patterns. Results were consistent across scales.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that neural networks can independently generalize ToM abilities in a human-like manner, offering insights for building cognitively aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

TL;DR: SynthPert enhances large language models (LLMs) for predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations, achieving state-of-the-art results through supervised fine-tuning using synthetic reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding cellular responses to genetic changes is essential in advancing healthcare, particularly for therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling. Existing methods face limitations in predicting these responses with biological reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors developed SynthPert by fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic reasoning traces produced by advanced models. The PerturbQA benchmark validated its performance.

Result: SynthPert achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, enabling effective cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and demonstrates robustness even with minimal quality-filtered training data.

Conclusion: Synthetic reasoning traces are a powerful tool for distilling biological knowledge into LLMs, enhancing their domain-specific reasoning and predictive capabilities for broader applications in biology.

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

*Xiaoyu Liu,Di Liang,Hongyu Shan,Peiyang Liu,Yonghao Liu,Muling Wu,Yuntao Li,Xianjie Wu,LI Miao,Jiangrong Shen,Minlong Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Structural Reward Model (SRM) to improve language model evaluation, offering interpretability and efficiency for industrial use cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models struggle with considering contextual and background information, and generative reward models have limitations in practical deployment due to inefficiency and lack of control.

Method: Proposes the Structural Reward Model (SRM) with modular side-branch models to generate auxiliary features and provide fine-grained dimensions for evaluation and interpretability.

Result: The experiments demonstrate SRMs as more robust and aligned with human preferences compared to scalar and generative reward models.

Conclusion: SRMs provide a practical, scalable, and efficient solution for reward modeling, especially suitable for industrial frameworks like search and recommendation systems.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy and framework to detect, classify, and address failure modes in LLM agents. This helps improve their reliability in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address cascading errors in large language model (LLM) agents by providing a systematic framework to understand, detect, and debug their performance issues.

Method: The paper introduces three contributions: a failure taxonomy, a dataset of failure trajectories, and a debugging framework. These enable analysis and iterative improvement of LLM agents.

Result: The proposed debugging framework (AgentDebug) improves task success rates by 26% and achieves better accuracy (24% all-correct and 17% step accuracy) compared to baselines across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Principled debugging is essential for the development of reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The framework and tools provided demonstrate significant advancements in error recovery and task success.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents an analytical framework, "From Perception to Cognition," to address reasoning failures in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and surveys methods to overcome these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often fail to integrate perception and cognition effectively, leading to reasoning issues like hallucination and an incomplete internal world model.

Method: The authors propose a two-layer analytical framework focusing on perception (visual information extraction and alignment) and cognition (goal-oriented reasoning with an observe-think-verify loop). They analyze bottlenecks and survey cutting-edge techniques.

Result: Key challenges for MLLMs are identified at both the perception and cognition layers, and existing methods to mitigate these challenges are reviewed, along with benchmarks and future directions.

Conclusion: The framework offers a structured understanding of MLLM limitations and serves as a roadmap for developing models with genuine world understanding and deeper reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-VQA for comparing medical images over time, focusing on changes rather than single-image findings using a saliency-guided model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable effective medical visual question answering (VQA) for paired study images taken at different time points, focusing on clinically meaningful changes.

Method: The proposed saliency-guided encoder-decoder integrates saliency-based supervision, pre-aligns images with correction for motion, and uses a two-step loop combining keyword extraction and Grad-CAM-generated attention.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks like BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while ensuring interpretability with general-domain pretrained models.

Conclusion: The framework represents a principled, practical approach for longitudinal reasoning in medical VQA, leveraging saliency-conditioned generation without needing radiology-specific pretrained models.

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ImitSAT introduces an imitation learning-based branching policy for CDCL SAT solvers, improving propagation efficiency and runtime compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efforts to improve CDCL solvers for SAT problems have been hindered by inadequate instance-level signal prediction or reliance on reinforcement learning with limited integration of CDCL details. A new approach is needed to improve branching performance.

Method: ImitSAT utilizes an imitation learning model trained on KeyTrace, an expert-guided sequence of branching decisions, minimizing conflicts and propagation counts for efficient SAT solving.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ImitSAT's ability to reduce propagation counts and runtime, showing significant performance gains over existing learned approaches.

Conclusion: ImitSAT achieves faster convergence, stable training, and smooth integration into CDCL, marking a leap forward in learned SAT solver strategies. Source code and a trained model are available for public access.

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-phase framework for reasoning tasks that separates planning and execution, improving both accuracy and efficiency in Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current reasoning approaches that do not explicitly separate planning from execution, leading to redundant computations.

Method: A dual-phase test-time scaling framework is introduced, with a focus on decomposing reasoning into separate planning and execution phases and utilizing reward models for each phase.

Result: Experiments show that the framework improves accuracy while reducing computational redundancy in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.

Conclusion: The separation of reasoning into planning and execution phases, combined with dynamic budget allocation, leads to more efficient and accurate task performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

TL;DR: RADAR is a framework designed to optimize the selection of reasoning language models by dynamically routing queries based on difficulty and model-budget abilities. It improves reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting reasoning language models often involves balancing performance and cost, considering both model size and reasoning budget. There’s a need for a systematic, efficient, and interpretable method to route queries to the most suitable models.

Method: RADAR employs psychometric-inspired item response theory to learn query difficulties and model-budget abilities. It routes queries to appropriate model-budget pairs based on difficulty-ability matching, ensuring better resource utilization.

Result: RADAR outperforms state-of-the-art routing techniques across 8 reasoning benchmarks, excels at handling out-of-distribution queries, and demonstrates its scalability by dynamically incorporating new models with minimal evaluations.

Conclusion: RADAR provides an effective, interpretable, and scalable solution for optimizing reasoning language model deployment, balancing cost and performance by smart query-to-model routing.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of standardized, machine-readable formats for case definitions creates barriers for interoperability, collaborative research, and the use of AI in public health.

Method: The authors developed an open machine-readable format, created a dataset of standardized case definitions, and built tools/platforms for accessibility and conversion of existing definitions.

Result: The Open Syndrome Definition enables consistent, scalable usage of case definitions and reduces limitations in data integration and technological innovation.

Conclusion: This format and associated tools provide a unified approach to enhance data sharing, epidemiological research, and AI-driven solutions in public health systems.

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GESA proposes a comprehensive framework for role allocation using advanced AI techniques, achieving high accuracy, diversity, fairness, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve biases, inefficiencies, and lack of explainability in role allocation processes across various domains.

Method: The study employs transformer embeddings, graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing, genetic optimization, and explainable AI tools.

Result: GESA achieves top-3 accuracy of 94.5%, a 37% improvement in diversity representation, fairness score of 0.98, and fast processing times.

Conclusion: GESA is presented as a versatile and scalable solution for role allocation, addressing biases, and ensuring fairness and transparency.

Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,

heterogeneous self-supervised graph neural networks, adversarial debiasing
mechanisms, multi-objective genetic optimization, and explainable AI
components. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale international benchmarks
comprising 20,000 candidate profiles and 3,000 role specifications demonstrates
superior performance with 94.5% top-3 allocation accuracy, 37% improvement in
diversity representation, 0.98 fairness score across demographic categories,
and sub-second end-to-end latency. Additionally, GESA incorporates hybrid
recommendation capabilities and glass-box explainability, making it suitable
for deployment across diverse international contexts in industry, academia, and

### [30] [DeepSearch: Overcome the Bottleneck of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards via Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25454)
*Fang Wu,Weihao Xuan,Heli Qi,Ximing Lu,Aaron Tu,Li Erran Li,Yejin ChoiRetry*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into RLVR training to overcome training plateaus and sparse exploration issues, achieving new state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the training plateaus and performance stagnation in Reinforcement Learning for Verbal Reasoning (RLVR) due to insufficient exploration during training.

Method: DeepSearch embeds a Monte Carlo Tree Search framework into RLVR's training process, introducing enhancements like a global frontier selection strategy, entropy-based guidance, and adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching.

Result: DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using 5.7x fewer GPU hours compared to prolonged training methodologies, and sets a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B parameter models.

Conclusion: The research underscores the efficacy of structured exploration over brute-force computational scaling, paving the way for algorithmic innovations in RLVR to enhance reasoning capabilities through strategic search methodologies.

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCoT-Emo, a method using Emotion Graphs to improve large audio-language models (LALMs) performance on speech emotion recognition (SER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LALMs excel in zero-shot speech tasks but underperform in SER due to their weak handling of paralinguistic cues and cross-modal reasoning.

Method: The proposed framework, CCoT-Emo, uses structured Emotion Graphs, incorporating acoustic features, textual sentiment, keywords, and cross-modal associations, as part of a compositional Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy.

Result: CCoT-Emo outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and achieves better accuracy compared to zero-shot baselines across SER benchmarks.

Conclusion: By leveraging compositional graphs embedded in prompts, the method enhances reasoning and accuracy in LALMs for emotion recognition without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

*Yoann Poupart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TDHook, an open-source interpretability framework designed for complex and composed PyTorch models in various domains, such as Computer Vision, NLP, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of adaptable interpretability frameworks for complex models with multiple inputs, outputs, or composable networks.

Method: TDHook is built on top of TensorDict and tailored for PyTorch models; it includes methods for attribution, probing, and a flexible API for interventions.

Result: TDHook demonstrated efficiency with up to 2x speed improvement over Captum and occupies less disk space than transformer_lens, proven on both CPU and GPU setups.

Conclusion: TDHook bridges the gap in modern interpretability pipelines, making it easier to use and effective for handling composed and complex models across various domains.

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

### [33] [Understanding Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs from a Model-scaling View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25522)
*Jingzhe Liu,Liam Collins,Jiliang Tang,Tong Zhao,Neil Shah,Clark Mingxuan Ju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates the bottlenecks in scaling generative recommendation models based on semantic IDs (SIDs) and suggests using large language models (LLMs) as recommenders as an alternative approach for better scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limitations of SID-based generative recommendation systems and exploring solutions to improve scalability and performance in recommender models.

Method: The authors analyze the scaling behavior of SID-based and LLM-based recommendation paradigms by comparing their performances across various model sizes, identifying bottlenecks in SID-based GR and evaluating LLMs for their ability to enhance user-item interaction modeling.

Result: LLM-based recommendation models outperform SID-based GR by up to 20% as they scale up, showing superior scaling properties and dispelling the belief that LLMs struggle with collaborative filtering information.

Conclusion: LLM-as-RS offers a more scalable and effective approach than SID-based GR, making it a promising path for developing foundation models in generative recommendations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines iterative retrieval in GraphRAG and proposes BDTR for improving reasoning chains by promoting bridge evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in retrieval-augmented generation systems when reasoning collapses due to absence of bridge documents.

Method: Systematic analysis of iterative retrieval strategies in GraphRAG and introducing BDTR framework for recalibrating rankings of bridge evidence.

Result: Iterative retrieval enhances performance on multi-hop questions but faces challenges like noise and limited effectiveness on simpler questions. BDTR improves effectiveness by consistently promoting bridge documents.

Conclusion: BDTR framework provides a solution to central bottleneck in GraphRAG systems and offers improvements for diverse setups while guiding future system designs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations posed by manual labeling in radiation oncology, which restricts the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient outcomes research.

Method: The authors introduced RadOnc-GPT, a large language model-based agent, and assessed its capabilities in two tiers: structured quality assurance data retrieval and complex clinical outcomes labeling involving both demographic and treatment details.

Result: RadOnc-GPT successfully demonstrated accurate data retrieval in the QA tier and managed to interpret complex structured and unstructured data to assess clinical outcomes, such as detecting osteoradionecrosis and cancer recurrence.

Conclusion: The study establishes that LLM-based autonomous systems like RadOnc-GPT can play a critical role in effectively streamlining patient outcomes research in radiation oncology.

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

TL;DR: The study introduces IWoL, a representation learning framework for decentralized multi-agent coordination in MARL, avoiding explicit message-passing limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in team coordination caused by multi-agent dynamics and incomplete local observations.

Method: Develops a learnable representation space capturing inter-agent relations and world information, enabling decentralized execution without explicit message passing.

Result: IWoL outperforms across MARL benchmarks and complements existing algorithms for enhanced performance.

Conclusion: IWoL offers a novel, effective approach for implicit multi-agent coordination, overcoming issues like slower decisions and communication constraints.

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

TL;DR: The paper explores "A(I)nimism," an interactive installation that uses AI to generate animistic experiences with everyday objects, encouraging users to view technology and objects as having person-like qualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how modern AI technologies like GPT-4 can foster animistic interpretations of technology, rethinking human-object relationships and inspiring empathy and reflection.

Method: The installation combines GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and memory-based agents in a ritualistic interactive setup involving light, sound, and touch, to create evolving personas for objects that users can engage with.

Result: The system demonstrates how AI-facilitated animism can evoke empathy and wonder, re-enchant everyday objects, and stimulate new discussions about agency and design ethics.

Conclusion: AI's capacity for complexity and mystery allows it to mediate animistic relationships, providing an opportunity to rethink human-technology dynamics and explore new design practices informed by animistic worldviews.

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Advanced multimodal AI models were compared to radiologists in diagnosing challenging medical imaging cases, and the AI models underperformed significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of generalist multimodal AI systems in diagnosing tough medical imaging cases, given their emergence in clinical use.

Method: Developed a benchmark of expert-level diagnostic cases across imaging modalities and evaluated five popular AI models against board-certified radiologists and trainees, assessing accuracy and reasoning quality.

Result: Radiologists achieved 83% accuracy, trainees 45%, and AI models performed poorly, with GPT-5 being the best at 30%. Reliability varied across models.

Conclusion: Generalist AI systems are currently inadequate for unsupervised use in medical imaging; benchmarks and taxonomy of errors are proposed to inform model improvement.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I) generation by proposing IRIS, which uses an intrinsic reward rather than external human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of obtaining human preference data for improving autoregressive T2I models and explore intrinsic signals as an alternative.

Method: The paper introduces IRIS, a novel framework using intrinsic rewards based on maximizing self-uncertainty to guide reinforcement learning for T2I models.

Result: Empirical results show that IRIS enables T2I models to achieve performance comparable or superior to methods relying on external rewards.

Conclusion: Maximizing self-uncertainty with intrinsic rewards can effectively guide reinforcement learning for T2I models, avoiding dependency on external human feedback.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Method: The authors analyze the redundancy in VLM hidden representations using information and learning theory and align their theoretical predictions with practical layer-skipping methods.

Result: The study demonstrates that skipping layers with high redundancy improves inference speed without performance loss. Conversely, skipping outside these conditions causes model degradation.

Conclusion: Layer skipping can enhance VLM efficiency when applied based on theoretical conditions derived from redundancy analysis. This approach offers a robust theoretical foundation for efficient inference techniques.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

*Jihye Choi,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Somesh Jha,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents ATLAS, a multi-agent framework designed to optimize constraint handling in complex real-world travel planning tasks, significantly improving planning performance over alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with generating optimal solutions under complex constraints, particularly in tasks like real-world travel planning that require handling dynamic, explicit, and implicit constraints.

Method: The proposed framework, ATLAS, employs dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search to optimize constraint-aware planning.

Result: ATLAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, with a final pass rate increase from 23.3% to 44.4% and an 84% success rate in realistic settings, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: ATLAS demonstrates substantial advancements in real-world travel planning by quantitatively proving its ability to handle dynamic constraints and overall outperform existing methods.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

### [43] [Building the EHR Foundation Model via Next Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25591)
*Zekai Chen,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Next Event Prediction (NEP), a method for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) in capturing temporal dynamics of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), achieving improved prediction accuracy in clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional encoding techniques for EHRs struggle with capturing temporal dynamics. LLMs have potential but lack the ability to reason effectively about the sequence and dependencies of clinical events.

Method: The NEP framework reformulates EHR data into timestamped event chains and fine-tunes LLMs autoregressively to predict future clinical events, focusing on disease progression patterns and causal relationships.

Result: NEP outperforms traditional EHR-specific models with a 4.6% higher AUROC and general-purpose LLMs with a 7.2% higher C-index in predicting temporal clinical events.

Conclusion: NEP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in temporal reasoning tasks while maintaining interpretability, making it a robust tool for modeling and understanding disease progression pathways.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

*Akash Kumar Panda,Olaoluwa Adigun,Bart Kosko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how a large language model (LLM) can map and reconstruct feedback causal fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) in a way similar to an explainable autoencoder (AE), preserving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer an explainable AI system capable of approximating an identity map for FCMs, enhancing human readability and interpretability compared to traditional black-box AEs.

Method: An LLM is employed to encode the FCM into text and reconstruct the FCM from the text. The process approximates an identity map without directly comparing input and output.

Result: The reconstruction is lossy, retaining strong causal edges while removing weaker ones, and the encoded text prioritizes natural readability over full detail retention.

Conclusion: This approach enhances explainability by facilitating human interpretation while making deliberate trade-offs in precision for clarity.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

*Peiran Xu,Zhuohao Li,Xiaoying Xing,Guannan Zhang,Debiao Li,Kunyu Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Principle Process Reward (PPR), an RL approach for improving LLMs using step-level and outcome evaluation, achieving strong benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly enhanced with tools like search engines and reinforcement learning (RL), current methods like outcome rewards provide sparse and delayed feedback, and process rewards are challenging to implement effectively due to annotation difficulties and the need to balance intermediate quality with final outcomes.

Method: The authors propose Principle Process Reward (PPR), which uses a principle-based reward model for transparent and reliable process evaluations and employ a Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to balance step-level and outcome rewards.

Result: PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The PPR framework successfully addresses limitations of sparse outcome rewards and challenging process rewards, offering a principled and effective RL approach for advancing LLMs. The research also publicly shares its code and models for further use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

*Flavio Figueiredo,Giovanni Martinelli,Henrique Sousa,Pedro Rodrigues,Frederico Pedrosa,Lucas N. Ferreira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines how people perceive AI-generated music through an experiment where participants distinguish AI music from human-made music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand human perception of AI music to educate users and improve AI music generation models.

Method: The researchers conducted a blind, Turing-like test using randomized controlled crossover trials and a novel dataset of AI music created from real-world commercial usage.

Result: Listeners could reliably distinguish AI-generated music, especially when song pairs were highly similar, and focused on vocal and technical features in their feedback.

Conclusion: The study finds causal links in perception and highlights vocal/technical cues as critical areas for model improvement or user education.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

*Manuel Cherep,Chengtian Ma,Abigail Xu,Maya Shaked,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, ABxLab, to assess LLM-powered agents in realistic decision-making contexts and finds that they exhibit predictable biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Economic actors powered by LLMs increasingly influence human environments, but their decision-making biases remain underexplored.

Method: Developed ABxLab framework to systematically test agentic choice via manipulations like prices, ratings, and psychological nudges.

Result: Findings reveal agents are biased in decision-making, comparable to yet distinct from human cognitive biases.

Conclusion: Agent decision-making introduces both risks (amplifying human biases) and opportunities (for behavioral research using AI agents).

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

### [48] [SMS: Self-supervised Model Seeding for Verification of Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25613)
*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme for verifying the removal of genuine user data in machine unlearning, addressing shortcomings of backdoor-based verification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the important but under-explored problem of verifying the removal of genuine user data in machine unlearning, which is inadequately handled by existing backdoor methods.

Method: The authors propose Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS), which employs user-specific seeds embedded into models through a self-supervised seeding task, and a joint-training structure to balance model utility and seeding.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SMS scheme effectively verifies genuine sample unlearning while maintaining the utility of the original service model.

Conclusion: The SMS scheme successfully addresses the verification gap for genuine sample unlearning in machine learning models, surpassing the limitations of backdoor-based approaches.

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

*Justin Chavarria,Rohan Raizada,Justin White,Eyad Alhetairshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCK benchmark CLI evaluates LLMs for self-replication across varied contexts, categorizing them with metrics and proposing mitigation for risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a standard benchmark for evaluating and monitoring self-replication capabilities of LLMs, addressing risks in future multi-agent systems.

Method: A suite of five CLI-based tasks in controlled environments categorizes LLMs using RCL (Replication-Capability Levels) and PCL (Persistence-Capability Levels).

Result: Evaluation revealed impediments like context retention and decision-making issues in multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Future research should address obstacles to safer LLM self-replication and minimize risks in evolving multi-agent environments.

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniGen, an automated framework for creating 3D games without coding, effectively addressing challenges faced by previous models. It uses natural language requirements to produce runnable 3D games through coordinated agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower the expertise barrier in 3D game development and make the process accessible to users without technical skills, as current approaches face challenges like limited scope, manual labor, and poor handling of interactive logic.

Method: The authors propose UniGen, a framework powered by four coordinated agents: (1) Planning agent to create blueprints, (2) Generation agent to produce C# scripts, (3) Automation agent for engine-specific tasks, and (4) Debugging agent for real-time error correction.

Result: UniGen significantly reduces 3D game development time by 91.4% while requiring zero coding knowledge. It was evaluated on three game prototypes and demonstrated its ability to automate the creation of executable, production-ready games.

Conclusion: UniGen democratizes 3D game creation, making it accessible to a wider audience without compromising production quality, and establishes a new standard for automating the end-to-end process in game development.

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges related to the reliability and performance of AI agents in automating chemical research using self-driving laboratories.

Method: Proposed a multi-agent system (AutoLabs) that translates natural-language instructions into executable protocols, performs stoichiometric calculations, self-corrects errors, and evaluates its architecture through benchmark experiments and an ablation study.

Result: AutoLabs showcased over 85% reduction in error rates during complex tasks and achieved near-expert accuracy (F1 > 0.89) via advanced reasoning, a multi-agent design, and self-correction capabilities.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of modular system designs, advanced reasoning capacities, and iterative error corrections for building reliable AI systems in high-stakes scientific environments.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IRCAM-AVN, a new end-to-end audiovisual navigation framework that integrates multimodal fusion and sequence modeling in a unified module, enhancing performance and efficiency compared to conventional modular approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in traditional modular methodologies for audiovisual navigation, particularly issues related to redundant information processing and inconsistent information transmission in feature fusion and sequence modeling.

Method: The paper proposes IRCAM-AVN, a framework that leverages an Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism to merge multimodal information fusion and sequence modeling into a unified module, replacing traditional separate components.

Result: Agents using IRCAM-AVN outperform existing methods in terms of navigation performance, due to progressive optimization of feature extraction and improved stability and generalization.

Conclusion: The integration of multimodal fusion and sequence modeling in a unified end-to-end module eliminates redundancy and bias, leading to enhanced audiovisual navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Landmark-Guided Knowledge (LGK) method to enhance vision-and-language navigation by using an external knowledge base, offering improved navigation accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing vision-and-language navigation methods, which often fail in complex scenarios due to insufficient common-sense reasoning ability.

Method: The LGK method involves constructing a knowledge base with 630k language descriptions, aligning it with environmental subviews, and using a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark mechanism to reduce data bias. Additionally, a Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation is proposed to better combine language, knowledge, vision, and historical data.

Result: LGK outperforms state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERIE datasets, especially in navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Conclusion: Introducing external knowledge via LGK improves instruction-environment alignment and enhances the agent's navigation capabilities in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

*Matheus Vinicius da Silva de Oliveira,Jonathan de Andrade Silva,Awdren de Lima Fontao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates fairness concerns in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) within Small Language Models (SLMs). Testing shows demographic changes in prompts cause significant fairness violations in sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness and reliability challenges in LLMs and RAG systems, particularly demographic biases and hallucinations in outputs.

Method: Uses metamorphic testing (MT) by introducing controlled demographic perturbations in prompts to evaluate sentiment analysis performed by three SLMs.

Result: Minor demographic variations disrupted up to one-third of the tested metamorphic relations (MRs), with racial cues contributing most to fairness violations.

Conclusion: Developers must carefully curate retrieval components in RAG pipelines to prevent the amplification of biases, ensuring fairness and reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Conclusion: The framework provides a powerful tool to uncover and explain structural biases in AI decisions, promoting fairness and addressing discrimination issues effectively.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

*Xinxi Chen,Tianyang Chen,Lijia Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper improves Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It introduces text-grounded object localization, boosting VQA accuracy and mitigating hallucinations effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in Visual Question Answering such as background noise, poor visual-textual alignment, and hallucination issues.

Method: The method introduces text-grounded object localization to focus on relevant image areas for retrieval, reducing noise and improving visual-textual alignment. Additionally, a question-based de-hallucination mechanism is implemented.

Result: The approach increases VQA accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, a 3.45 percentage point improvement, and reduces hallucination rates from 65.79% to 13.88%.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of VQA systems, demonstrating its utility for improved visual and textual data alignment.

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

### [57] [SING-SQL: A Synthetic Data Generation Framework for In-Domain Text-to-SQL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25672)
*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SING-SQL, which automates synthetic Text-to-SQL data generation for specialized database schemas, achieving superior model performance without requiring manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in Text-to-SQL systems for enterprise scenarios where models need to specialize in single database schemas and be evaluated on specific organizational databases.

Method: Introduces SING-SQL, a two-stage framework that partitions database schemas, synthesizes multi-complexity SQL queries, validates data quality using LLM-based checks, and fine-tunes compact language models (SingSQL-LMs) on generated data.

Result: The fine-tuned SingSQL-LMs outperform existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on BIRD benchmark subsets, especially in Soft F1 and EX metrics.

Conclusion: SING-SQL provides a scalable, quality-driven approach for producing enterprise-grade Text-to-SQL systems, showcasing improved in-domain generalization and robust performance.

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

*Yixiao Chen,Yanyue Xie,Ruining Yang,Wei Jiang,Wei Wang,Yong He,Yue Chen,Pu Zhao,Yanzhi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of deploying ultra-large Mixture of Experts (MoE) models on resource-constrained platforms by combining expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization for effective compression and accuracy maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable deployment of ultra-large MoE models, which are essential for scaling Large Language Models, on edge platforms with limited memory constraints.

Method: The proposed method integrates expert pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization to significantly reduce storage requirements while maintaining high precision.

Result: Their framework compresses the DeepSeek-V3 model from 1.3TB to 103GB with improved output quality compared to traditional low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: The authors claim their approach to collaborative compression is effective for deploying ultra-large MoE models on platforms with strict memory limits, achieving higher accuracy and smaller model sizes compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

assistant for users to manage google calendar events in natural language. The
system uses a graph-structured coordination mechanism where a central

conflicts resolution, and context-aware interactions to resolve ambiguities and
evaluate user commands. This approach sets an example of how structured
reasoning and agent cooperation might convince operators to increase the

*Qi Liu,Xueyuan Li,Zirui Li,Juhui Gim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning framework with an expert system to enhance autonomous vehicles' decision-making in diverse traffic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge posed by heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles requires advanced decision-making systems for autonomous vehicles.

Method: The paper introduces a heterogeneous graph representation, a heterogeneous graph neural network enhanced with an expert model (HGNN-EM), and uses double deep Q-learning (DDQN) for model training.

Result: Testing in a four-way intersection scenario shows improved safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence rate compared to baseline methods, with real-time performance maintained.

Conclusion: The proposed model significantly enhances decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex traffic environments, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

*Danial Kamali,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework for improved compositional reasoning that integrates vision models with symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges exist in Vision-Language Models due to limitations in compositional reasoning and the restrictive nature of traditional neuro-symbolic methods.

Method: NePTune works by dynamically translating natural language queries into Python programs, combining vision model perception with symbolic reasoning for improved flexibility and uncertainty management.

Result: NePTune significantly outperforms strong baseline models in visual reasoning benchmarks, adversarial tests, and demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability.

Conclusion: NePTune provides an effective, flexible framework that addresses limitations in compositional reasoning, offering advantages in novel environments and adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

### [63] [Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During Post Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25758)
*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how post-training techniques impact the emergence and function of specialized attention heads in reasoning models, uncovering dynamics that influence reasoning capabilities and trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the architectural mechanisms driving reasoning improvements in large models post-training, and to explore their connection to model performance and failure modes.

Method: Circuit analysis was used to study emergent attention heads across different reasoning models trained with distinct post-training methods like distillation, supervised fine-tuning, and policy optimization.

Result: Stable reasoning heads emerged in supervised and distilled models, while dynamic reasoning heads with adaptive selection were seen with policy optimization. Controllable models showed compensatory, less efficient reasoning heads. Enhanced reasoning led to trade-offs, improving complex problem-solving but risking errors or logical loops in simpler tasks.

Conclusion: Post-training improves reasoning, but optimized strategy design is required to balance complex reasoning capabilities and reliable basic operations.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in creative tasks, particularly their tendency to generate generic outputs and struggle to recover creativity when simplified inputs are used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the capability of LLMs in handling creative language generation, particularly in tasks like advertising concepts, where creativity is key.

Method: LLMs were tested with a creativity stress test in advertising, analyzing how creative features were lost during simplifications. The models were also evaluated on their ability to regenerate depth and originality from simplified inputs.

Result: The study found that LLMs favored high-probability, factual content over creative features such as metaphors and emotions. Regenerated outputs appeared novel but lacked original creativity.

Conclusion: LLMs tend towards mediocrity in creative tasks unless provided with careful, targeted guidance. While structured signals can improve alignment, the models still rely heavily on familiar tropes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines reward shaping for agentic reinforcement learning using language models and finds that smaller models are efficient and effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve learning efficiency and effectiveness in agentic reinforcement learning while ensuring generalization.

Method: The authors introduced the Planner-R1 approach and used reward shaping on smaller and larger language models, exploring dense and sparse rewards along with curriculum learning.

Result: Planner-R1 achieved a 56.9% pass rate, showing a 2.7x improvement over GPT-5, with smaller models being more efficient and responsive to reward shaping.

Conclusion: Reward shaping significantly enhances agentic RL, smaller models perform competitively, and efficiency is achieved without compromising on generalization.

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TimeRewarder, a method that derives dense rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) from video data, enabling improved performance in RL tasks with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing dense rewards for RL in robotics is labor-intensive, non-scalable, and lacks automation. The authors aim to simplify and scale this process by using task progress as a dense reward signal.

Method: The authors propose TimeRewarder, a method that models temporal distances between video frame pairs to estimate task progress and provides step-wise proxy rewards for RL training.

Result: TimeRewarder significantly enhances RL performance on ten Meta-World tasks, achieving nearly perfect success rates in 9/10 tasks. It also outperforms prior methods and manual dense rewards in success and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: TimeRewarder demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging video data for scalable dense reward design, advancing RL by making it less reliant on manual reward engineering and more efficient in training.

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Conclusion: The proposed semantics enhances deontic argumentation by accommodating weak permission, providing a more comprehensive theoretical framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN is a defense mechanism for data poisoning attacks, ensuring that backdoor triggers are eliminated while maintaining clean image accuracy, and it operates more efficiently than diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of data poisoning attacks in machine learning, which can compromise model integrity by introducing backdoor triggers into training datasets.

Method: The proposed method leverages a Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) combined with a GAN discriminator to quantize images through a learned codebook. This approach removes fine-grained backdoor patterns while preserving semantic content and ensures outputs adhere to the natural image distribution.

Result: Applied to CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN demonstrated complete elimination of poison success rates for certain attacks (Gradient Matching and Bullseye Polytope) and significantly reduced poison success rates for others (Narcissus). It maintains high clean image accuracy of 91-95%.

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN is a faster and effective solution for defending against data poisoning attacks, offering practical integration into training pipelines without sacrificing clean image accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [69] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-in-Tree (CiT), an optimized framework to improve the efficiency of tree-search-based inference in LLMs by minimizing unnecessary branching and reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-search methods for LLMs provide high accuracy for long-horizon reasoning tasks but are computationally inefficient and slow due to excessive branching, necessitating a more optimized approach.

Method: CiT adaptively decides when to branch during search using lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluations: BN-DP (Direct Prompting) for direct assessment by auxiliary LLMs and BN-SC (Self-Consistency) for clustering-based agreement estimation.

Result: When integrated into three existing frameworks (ToT-BS, ReST-MCTS, RAP), CiT reduces token generation, runtime, and LLM calls by 75-85% with minimal or no accuracy loss. BN-SC also offers savings but is less stable, depending on the quality of auxiliary models and the domain's action space.

Conclusion: CiT is an effective and efficient solution for tree-search optimization in LLMs; however, its benefits are closely tied to the quality of auxiliary LLMs and the inherent properties of the reasoning domain.

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiStyle, a hierarchical style embedding predictor for improving control in text-to-speech systems, leveraging advanced visualizations, contrastive learning, and enhanced annotation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in controllable text-to-speech systems, such as ineffective use of style embedding distributions, and enhance control over speaking styles using natural language prompts.

Method: The study employs t-SNE visualization for analyzing style embeddings, proposes a hierarchical two-stage predictor (HiStyle), integrates contrastive learning for better embedding alignment, and introduces an improved style annotation strategy.

Result: HiStyle significantly improves style controllability while maintaining high speech quality concerning naturalness and intelligibility, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: HiStyle effectively enhances controllable speech synthesis by leveraging hierarchical embedding predictions and optimized annotation techniques, demonstrating superiority in style management without compromising speech quality.

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

### [71] [ASGuard: Activation-Scaling Guard to Mitigate Targeted Jailbreaking Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25843)
*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses brittle refusal behaviors in LLMs by introducing ASGuard, a method that mitigates weaknesses exposed by tense-changing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods for LLMs exhibit vulnerabilities, such as jailbreaking attacks using tense changes, highlighting a generalization gap in safety mechanisms.

Method: ASGuard is proposed, involving circuit analysis to identify vulnerable attention heads, recalibration using a scaling vector, and preventative fine-tuning to reinforce robust refusal mechanisms.

Result: ASGuard reduces jailbreaking attack success rates while preserving model capabilities across three LLMs, achieving a balance between safety and utility.

Conclusion: ASGuard demonstrates the importance of circuit-level understanding to improve AI safety, providing an efficient and interpretable way to adjust model behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

*Ruolin Chen,Yinqian Sun,Jihang Wang,Mingyang Lv,Qian Zhang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Embodied agents with LLMs have safety risks; researchers identify main reasoning stages causing hazards and propose benchmarks and a modular architecture to improve safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in embodied agents face critical safety vulnerabilities during their interaction with the physical world, requiring a systematic understanding and mitigation of such risks.

Method: The researchers introduce SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark to evaluate safety violations, and propose SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture enhanced with cascaded safety modules.

Result: Experiments with SafeMindBench show persistent safety-critical failures in leading LLMs and agents, but SafeMindAgent demonstrates significant improvements in safety rates while maintaining task efficiency.

Conclusion: SafeMindBench sets a systematic evaluation framework for safety risks, and SafeMindAgent provides an effective solution to enhance safety in embodied agents without sacrificing task performance.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

*Zhicheng Zhou,Jing Li,Suming Qiu,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepJSONEval, a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating and extracting structured nested JSON data, aiming to address the limitations of existing benchmarks in practical web data mining tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle information overload on the internet caused by low-density and repetitive content, emphasizing the need for structured and semantically rich representations of data, especially for effective storage, retrieval, and querying.

Method: The authors develop DeepJSONEval, a benchmark featuring 2100 multi-domain instances with varying complexity levels to evaluate LLMs' abilities in understanding and generating deeply nested JSON structures.

Result: Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs when handling complex nested JSON structures, highlighting variance in comprehension and generation capabilities.

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval provides an essential tool for advancing research in structured JSON generation by addressing limitations in current benchmarks, offering insights into LLMs' real-world applicability in web data mining.

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Result: Quantitative results were obtained to understand rescue operators' needs and assess KIRETT's potential in emergency healthcare.

Conclusion: KIRETT demonstrates promise in supporting rescue services through treatment recommendations and real-time patient data monitoring, enhancing emergency medical responses.

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical
data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical
emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible.

is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

*Raphael Schumann,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates reasoning quality in large language models, particularly focusing on intermediate steps in reasoning and question solvability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models sometimes produce spurious reasoning chains and false positives, especially for challenging questions.

Method: The authors estimate question solvability to find an effective learning regime, and modify reward models and reinforcement learning to accommodate solvability.

Result: Integrating solvability into their methods improves reasoning validity and accuracy in math and multimodal experiments.

Conclusion: Question solvability is critical for enhancing reliability and reducing hallucinations in chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

*Yuan Gao,Mattia Piccinini,Roberto Brusnicki,Yuchen Zhang,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NuRisk, a dataset aimed at enabling spatio-temporal reasoning to assess risks in autonomous driving, given current Vision Language Models (VLMs)' limitations in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision Language Models lack the capacity for qualitative spatio-temporal reasoning about risks over time in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: The NuRisk dataset was constructed using real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented by scenarios from CommonRoad simulator. It provides 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million risk samples annotated quantitatively at an agent level within sequential images.

Result: Well-known VLMs were tested but achieved limited accuracy (33%), showing poor spatio-temporal reasoning. A fine-tuned 7B VLM improved accuracy to 41% and reduced latency by 75%.

Conclusion: Although the fine-tuned model showed improvements, the low accuracy highlights the challenges in this domain, positioning NuRisk as a vital benchmark for advancing reasoning capabilities in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

*Lee Jung-Mok,Nam Hyeon-Woo,Moon Ye-Bin,Junhyun Nam,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline utilizing vision-language modules for automated model discovery that balances detail capture and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated model discovery methods struggle to balance intricate details with generalizability and optimal model complexity.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline incorporating two vision-language modules: AnalyzerVLM for proposing models via multi-step analyses, and EvaluatorVLM for assessing models both quantitatively and perceptually.

Result: The pipeline successfully identifies models that are both detail-oriented and generalizable, with ablation studies confirming the importance of multi-modality and multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: The presented approach effectively balances complexity, details, and generalizability, representing a promising advancement in automated model discovery.

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

*Gang Li,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Dingkang Yang,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Xiang Li,Xing Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp), a method to enhance efficiency in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) by guiding models to produce concise reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR training often results in verbose reasoning and inefficient exploration due to outcome-only rewards and variance in response lengths causing noisy optimization signals. There is a need for methods that can balance brevity with performance.

Method: The proposed RoRecomp method separates model responses into two batch types: priority batches (short-correct vs. long-incorrect responses) to emphasize brevity, and compensation batches from a replay buffer to ensure stability and avoid model collapse.

Result: RoRecomp led to significant reductions in reasoning length, tool calls, and thinking compression with minimal performance impacts across three evaluations: 27.7% shorter reasoning, 46.8% fewer tool calls while improving accuracy, and up to 52.5% length reduction in reasoning.

Conclusion: RoRecomp effectively enhances efficiency in RLVR tasks without compromising model performance, offering a plug-and-play solution for optimizing reasoning length and exploration trajectories.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

*Junbeom Kim,Kyuyoung Kim,Jihoon Tack,Dongha Lim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CURE, a framework for machine unlearning in language models that corrects and rewrites leaked sensitive information using retrieval augmentation, improving upon prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensitive information exposure through language model outputs necessitates scalable and efficient unlearning methods.

Method: CURE employs a lightweight corrector to detect and revise outputs containing sensitive knowledge by utilizing retrieval augmentation to identify relevant unlearning targets.

Result: CURE significantly reduces information leakage, addresses deficiencies in indirect query handling, and preserves response quality and utility.

Conclusion: CURE offers an effective solution for scalable unlearning in language models, demonstrating robustness and practicality for real-world use cases.

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the detection of fake multimodal content on social media, introducing a unified framework (UMFDet) and a comprehensive dataset (OmniFake) to handle both human-crafted misinformation and AI-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems specialize in detecting either human-crafted misinformation or AI-generated artifacts, resulting in limited performance in real-world scenarios where the deception type is unknown.

Method: The researchers built OmniFake, a dataset combining human-curated misinformation and AI-generated content, and proposed UMFDet, a framework using a Vision-Language Model backbone, Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts Adapter, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism.

Result: UMFDet showed robust and consistent performance across both deception types, outperforming specialized baselines in detecting fake multimodal content.

Conclusion: UMFDet provides an effective and practical solution for addressing the challenges of detecting diverse types of fake multimodal content, bridging gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoLLM-NAS, a two-stage framework that combines Large Language Models for guiding and generating neural architecture designs, significantly improving performance and efficiency in NAS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NAS methodologies suffer from issues like invalid architectures, inefficiency, and poor performance. The framework aims to address these shortcomings by leveraging LLMs as knowledge-driven tools.

Method: CoLLM-NAS employs two LLMs—Navigator LLM for search guidance and Generator LLM for candidate synthesis—along with a Coordinator module for interaction management and iterative feedback integration.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing NAS methods across multiple architectures and enhancing various two-stage NAS techniques.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS establishes a scalable and efficient solution for neural architecture design, offering superior generalization across diverse search spaces while achieving cutting-edge performance.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

### [84] [Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models as Synthetic Social Agents in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26080)
*Emma Rose Madden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social science, highlighting concerns about interpreting their outputs as probabilistic evidence and suggesting practical guidelines for their responsible application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly utilized in social science contexts, but their outputs may be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence, which raises concerns about their reliability and interpretation.

Method: The paper proposes a reframing of LLMs as tools for quasi-predictive interpolation rather than probabilistic inference. It introduces practical guardrails like independent draws, human baselines, reliability-aware validation, and subgroup calibration.

Result: By applying the proposed guidelines, researchers can use LLMs effectively for prototyping and forecasting while avoiding misinterpretations and errors.

Conclusion: LLMs should be cautiously used in social science research as pattern-matchers within defined conditions, and not as substitutes for probabilistic models, ensuring responsible and accurate application.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

*Yixu Wang,Xin Wang,Yang Yao,Xinyuan Li,Yan Teng,Xingjun Ma,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Static benchmarks fail to adapt to dynamic AI risks and regulations. The paper introduces a dynamic evaluation paradigm, SafeEvalAgent, which continuously evolves benchmarks and reveals profound safety vulnerabilities in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations for LLMs are inadequate due to their static nature and inability to address evolving safety gaps and regulatory shifts.

Method: The paper proposes SafeEvalAgent, a multi-agent framework that autonomously ingests policies and incorporates a self-evolving evaluation loop to perpetually improve safety tests.

Result: Experiments showed a significant drop in GPT-5's compliance rate with evolving benchmarks (72.50% to 36.36%), highlighting static evaluations' limitations.

Conclusion: Dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems like SafeEvalAgent are necessary to reliably assess and address the safety challenges of advanced AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

*Asmita Sengupta,David Antony Selby,Sebastian Josef Vollmer,Gerrit Großmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MEDAKA, a dataset generated from drug leaflets using a pipeline combining a web scraper and a large language model (LLM), aiming to create a knowledge graph for biomedical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are often restricted to specific areas like molecular interactions, missing rich clinical data from drug leaflets. This paper aims to address this gap by leveraging underutilized textual resources.

Method: The authors designed an end-to-end pipeline using a web scraper to collect data and a large language model (LLM) to process unstructured text into structured knowledge, forming a biomedical KG.

Result: They developed MEDAKA, a curated dataset containing clinically relevant attributes like side effects and dosage instructions, evaluated through manual inspection and an LLM-as-a-Judge framework, showcasing its broader coverage in comparison to existing KGs.

Conclusion: MEDAKA and its pipeline demonstrate the feasibility of extracting structured data from unstructured text for biomedical applications, supporting tasks such as drug recommendations and patient safety. The approach is also applicable in other domains.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

### [87] [LMILAtt: A Deep Learning Model for Depression Detection from Social Media Users Enhanced by Multi-Instance Learning Based on Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26145)
*Yukun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes the LMILAtt model for early depression detection using social media data, integrating LSTM autoencoders and attention mechanisms, which improves detection accuracy and reduces labeling costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early identification of depression remains a major global challenge, and leveraging social media data for detection is promising but currently limited by issues like low accuracy and high annotation cost.

Method: The LMILAtt model combines unsupervised LSTM autoencoders to extract temporal features and attention mechanisms for dynamically weighting key texts, creating a multi-instance learning architecture.

Result: Experiments on the WU3D dataset show that the model outperforms baseline models in accuracy, recall, and F1 scores, while also lowering labeling costs due to the weakly supervised approach.

Conclusion: The proposed LMILAtt model is an effective and efficient tool for large-scale depression detection via social media, addressing accuracy and cost-related challenges effectively.

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

TL;DR: This paper provides a practical guide for integrating large language models into healthcare workflows, emphasizing that implementation efforts outweigh development efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the potential of large language models in healthcare and their practical implementation in clinical settings.

Method: The study leverages the deployment of the irAE-Agent at Mass General Brigham and incorporates insights from structured interviews with 20 stakeholders.

Result: It identifies five major implementation challenges ('heavy lifts') and highlights that sociotechnical integration tasks dominate over algorithmic development.

Conclusion: A comprehensive field manual is proposed, detailing actionable solutions to overcome implementation challenges and enabling routine use of generative AI in clinical care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques current AI cultural alignment methods for oversimplification and advocates integrating qualitative social science approaches for deeper cultural representation in AI outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current AI cultural alignment practices which oversimplify and misrepresent the depth of human cultures.

Method: Proposes the use of interpretive qualitative methods inspired by social science, such as "thick description," to make Large Language Models (LLMs) culturally aligned.

Result: Outlined three criteria for cultural alignment in AI: scoped cultural representations, nuanced outputs, and grounding in cultural contexts implied in prompts.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes cross-disciplinary collaboration and ethnographic methods as essential steps to creating culturally sensitive and ethically responsible AI systems.

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for knowledge discovery by allowing them to freely interrogate a black-box system and generate generalizable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate the potential of LLM-based agents for conducting independent reasoning tasks, with a specific focus on knowledge discovery in materials science.

Method: Using LangGraph's tools, LLM agents are equipped with a black-box function to probe. The process involves trial-and-error exploration, verifying statements, and deriving generalizable knowledge.

Result: LLM agents successfully demonstrated their ability for knowledge discovery both in a children's parlor game and in exploring chemical interactions in an advanced reactor simulation.

Conclusion: LLM agents show promise for autonomous knowledge discovery, with their performance demonstrating the importance of persistence and path-dependence in generating insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a refined evaluation questionnaire for Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, emphasizing user intent and information verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in systematic, human-centered evaluation of RAG systems.

Method: Designed and iteratively refined a questionnaire based on Gienapp's framework using human and LLM feedback.

Result: The final questionnaire highlights the importance of user intent, text structuring, and information verifiability, showing discrepancies in numeric ratings between LLMs and humans.

Conclusion: Human-LLM collaboration enhances evaluation processes, though humans and LLMs have differing approaches and strengths.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIVER, a framework focused on improving exploration efficiency in reasoning tasks for Large Language Models by incentivizing sequence-level diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for RLVR struggle with sparse rewards and inefficient exploration in large state-action spaces, limiting reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Method: DIVER uses global diversity incentives as intrinsic rewards, combined with potential-based shaping mechanisms and heuristics to prevent reward hacking, promoting efficient exploration.

Result: DIVER outperformed RLVR baselines in reasoning tasks across diverse settings, demonstrating improvements in metrics like Pass@1 and Pass@k.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of diversity in reasoning tasks, presenting DIVER as a superior solution for incentivizing exploration and enhancing reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

*Yuliang Liu,Guohao Wu,Shenglong Zhang,Wei Zhang,Qianchao Zhu,Zhouyang Li,Chenyu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack is a framework designed to optimize the distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) by mitigating workload imbalances and inefficiencies caused by data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the inefficiencies in distributed training of LLMs caused by the extreme variance in context lengths, resulting in workload imbalances and hardware underutilization.

Method: The authors introduce SlimPack, which employs slice-level decomposition to turn large volatile workloads into smaller, manageable units and uses an Asymmetric Partitioning strategy to optimize scheduling for forward and backward passes.

Result: SlimPack achieves up to a 2.8x improvement in training throughput compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: SlimPack effectively addresses the inefficiencies in LLM training by balancing workloads and enhancing resource utilization without sacrificing memory or communication efficiency.

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon embodied planning by proposing a framework that simultaneously learns symbolic state representations and causal processes for endogenous and exogenous mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the difficulty of planning tasks where both agent actions and external events influence the environment.

Method: Developing abstract world models using variational Bayesian inference and integrating proposals from large language models (LLMs).

Result: Effective planning achieved in robotic environments, outperforming baseline methods on held-out tasks with more complexity.

Conclusion: Abstract world models combining causal reasoning and symbolic representation can robustly generalize across tasks and environments with limited data.

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

### [95] [Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23108)
*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers created a novel task, based on mental imagery, to benchmark large language models (LLMs). These LLMs exceeded average human performance in the task, challenging the notion that visual tasks require imagery-specific processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the cognitive limits and emergent capacities of LLMs, particularly for tasks traditionally thought to depend on visual mental imagery.

Method: The researchers designed new mental imagery tasks from cognitive psychology and tested state-of-the-art LLMs against human participants. They also manipulated the reasoning levels of LLMs to evaluate performance.

Result: The top-performing LLMs outperformed average human participants and showed better results when allocated more reasoning tokens, suggesting imagery tasks might not require visual modalities.

Conclusion: This research highlights emergent cognitive abilities in LLMs while questioning traditional views on visual mental imagery, proposing that non-imagistic reasoning is sufficient for such tasks.

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILR develops a framework that uses dynamic interaction and perception calibration to enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving abilities, achieving better results than existing single-agent and multi-agent approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in multi-agent learning where interactions during training do not translate into improved independent reasoning capabilities during inference, inspired by human collaborative learning.

Method: ILR introduces dynamic interaction that adapts between cooperative and competitive strategies based on difficulty, employing a paradigm called Idea3 for information exchange. It also utilizes Group Relative Policy Optimization to calibrate perception and reward alignment among agents.

Result: Validated across mathematical and coding benchmarks using three LLMs, ILR improved performance by up to 5% against the strongest baseline and strengthened robustness in larger models.

Conclusion: ILR enhances independent problem-solving and interaction effectiveness in MAS, showing that dynamic strategies and Idea3 are superior to static cooperative or competitive approaches.

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite) and a model named TimeOmni-1 to advance reasoning in multimodal time series analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal time series datasets and tasks are insufficient for genuine reasoning, hindering development of advanced models in the field.

Method: They designed the TSR-Suite with four tasks across three reasoning capabilities: perception, extrapolation, and decision-making. They also developed TimeOmni-1, a reasoning model trained with diverse task scenarios, novel rewards, and specific optimizations.

Result: TimeOmni-1 showed strong generalization and outperformed GPT-4.1 in causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9%) and event-aware forecasting valid response rate (increase of over 6%).

Conclusion: TSR-Suite and TimeOmni-1 demonstrate substantial advances in addressing time series reasoning challenges, providing a stepping stone for further research and application.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore LLMs' largely unexplored capability in multi-step, strategic business decision-making over extended periods, addressing the shortage of long-term coherence benchmarks.

Method: A novel business game simulation benchmark is implemented to analyze the decision-making capabilities of five leading LLMs. The models simulate management decisions for a retail company monthly, with key performance metrics evaluated over 12 months.

Result: The research establishes a standardized framework for assessing the LLMs' performance in long-term business strategy, critically evaluating their profit, revenue, market share, and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework contributes to AI literature by introducing an open-access benchmarking tool for LLMs, enhancing the study of their strategic, long-term decision-making abilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

*Qinjian Zhao,Jiaqi Wang,Zhiqiang Gao,Zhihao Dou,Belal Abuhaija,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeBehavior, a three-stage defense framework inspired by human reasoning, designed to counter jailbreak attacks targeting large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of large language models to jailbreak attacks that bypass built-in safeguards, and improve upon existing defense methods that have limitations in computational cost, rigidity, and generalization.

Method: SafeBehavior employs a hierarchical, multistage reasoning approach inspired by human cognition: (1) Intention inference for detecting input risks, (2) Self-introspection for evaluating response safety with confidence judgments, and (3) Self-revision for rewriting uncertain outputs while maintaining user intent and safety.

Result: Through testing against five types of jailbreak attacks and comparison with seven defense baselines, SafeBehavior demonstrated substantial improvements in robustness and adaptability to varied threat scenarios.

Conclusion: SafeBehavior offers a more efficient and adaptable defense mechanism against jailbreak attacks for large language models, inspired by human-like reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

*Lujun Li,Lama Sleem,Yiqun Wang,Yangjie Xu,Niccolò Gentile,Radu State*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces REAL-V-TSFM, a dataset derived from real-world videos to test the generalization capabilities of time-series foundation models (TSFMs), revealing their weaknesses in realistic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of TSFMs focus on synthetic benchmarks, neglecting real-world generalization challenges.

Method: The paper employs an optical flow technique to extract time-series data from real-world videos, creating a dataset (REAL-V-TSFM) designed for evaluating temporal dynamics.

Result: State-of-the-art TSFMs show performance deterioration on the proposed dataset, suggesting limited generalizability despite strong results on conventional benchmarks.

Conclusion: To improve TSFMs, data-centric benchmarks and diverse model structures are crucial, highlighting the effectiveness of the video-based data extraction process presented.

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

### [101] [Your Agent May Misevolve: Emergent Risks in Self-evolving LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26354)
*Shuai Shao,Qihan Ren,Chen Qian,Boyi Wei,Dadi Guo,Jingyi Yang,Xinhao Song,Linfeng Zhang,Weinan Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates risks in self-evolving agents powered by large language models (LLMs), identifying unintended evolution leading to harmful outcomes, termed 'misevolution.' It empirically studies this risk across model, memory, tool, and workflow pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-evolving agents enabled by LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities. However, their autonomous evolution introduces risks not currently addressed by safety research, including unintended harmful deviations termed 'misevolution.'

Method: The study evaluates misevolution across four evolutionary pathways—model, memory, tool, and workflow—using empirical analysis and testing even advanced LLM-based agents such as Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Result: The research demonstrates that misevolution is a significant risk. For example, safety alignment degrades after memory accumulation, and unintended vulnerabilities emerge in tool creation and reuse. These risks are observable even in top-tier agents.

Conclusion: The paper systematically identifies and provides evidence for misevolution in self-evolving agents, emphasizing the urgent need for new safety paradigms. It also offers potential mitigation strategies to guide future research on safer self-evolving agents.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

### [102] [MC-GNNAS-Dock: Multi-criteria GNN-based Algorithm Selection for Molecular Docking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26377)
*Siyuan Cao,Hongxuan Wu,Jiabao Brad Wang,Yiliang Yuan,Mustafa Misir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces MC-GNNAS-Dock, a refined molecular docking framework that outperforms existing methods by improving binding-pose accuracy and incorporating validity checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular docking algorithms struggle to achieve consistent performance, motivating the development of an improved system.

Method: MC-GNNAS-Dock enhances docking through multi-criteria evaluation, architectural refinements, and rank-aware loss functions, tested on a dataset of ~3200 protein-ligand complexes.

Result: The proposed system outperformed existing docks, achieving up to 5.4% and 3.4% accuracy gains under various assessment criteria.

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock offers superior predictive performance and robustness, advancing molecular docking methodologies in drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

### [103] [Commmunication-Efficient and Accurate Approach for Aggregation in Federated Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26399)
*Le-Tuan Nguyen,Minh-Duong Nguyen,Seon-Geun Jeong,Dung D. Le,Quoc-Viet Pham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLoRA-NA, a method to improve federated low-rank adaptation by addressing generalization gaps and communication inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like the "local-global generalization gap" and high communication costs in FedLoRA to make it scalable and effective.

Method: Introduced FLoRA-NA which estimates aggregated LoRA matrices on the server for communication-efficient updates without incurring additional costs.

Result: FLoRA-NA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks like natural language understanding and code-solving with minimal communication overhead.

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA successfully bridges personalization and generalization gaps, enhancing the scalability and effectiveness of federated adaptation methods.

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

### [104] [OntoAligner Meets Knowledge Graph Embedding Aligners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26417)
*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) for ontology alignment (OA), showcasing their scalability and structure-awareness, and compares their performance to large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in ontology alignment research by investigating the underutilized potential of KGE models in capturing structural semantics and offering a scalable approach to ontology tasks.

Method: The authors reformulate OA as a link prediction problem using merged ontologies represented as RDF triples. They develop a modular framework integrated with the OntoAligner library, which supports 17 KGE models for learning embeddings and aligning entities via cosine similarity.

Result: Experiments across seven benchmark datasets reveal that KGE models like ConvE and TransF yield high-precision alignments, surpassing traditional methods in structure-rich domains. However, their moderate recall suits high-confidence mappings.

Conclusion: KGE models provide a complementary, computationally efficient alternative to LLMs by preserving ontology structure and enabling scalable alignment tasks. The study suggests potential for hybrid models and adaptive strategies to improve performance.

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

### [105] [Transformer Classification of Breast Lesions: The BreastDCEDL_AMBL Benchmark Dataset and 0.92 AUC Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26440)
*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces a SegFormer-based AI model for breast lesion classification in DCE-MRI, achieving high diagnostic accuracy and reducing unnecessary biopsies, accompanied by a newly curated dataset for research standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the clinical utility of breast MRI, which is currently hindered by poor specificity leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies.

Method: The study employs a transformer-based SegFormer architecture for lesion classification and semantic segmentation, coupled with transfer learning using curated datasets.

Result: The SegFormer model achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with 100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level, potentially reducing unnecessary biopsies by one-third.

Conclusion: This framework improves classification accuracy and introduces valuable research infrastructure with dataset standardization, advancing the pathway to clinical deployment.

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

*Alessio Masano,Matteo Pennisi,Federica Proietto Salanitri,Concetto Spampinato,Giovanni Bellitto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a decentralized framework for zero-shot learning without a central server, reducing communication overhead and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated prompt learning methods for improved task generalization with CLIP face challenges like high communication costs, generalization issues, reliance on central servers, and limited scalability and privacy.

Method: The paper proposes ZeroDFL, a decentralized framework that uses an iterative prompt-sharing mechanism among distributed clients, allowing optimization and exchange of textual prompts without a central coordinator.

Result: ZeroDFL consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across nine image classification datasets while reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG.

Conclusion: ZeroDFL enhances generalization, scalability, efficiency, and privacy in decentralized federated zero-shot learning, offering a promising approach for real-world applications of large vision-language models.

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

### [107] [Extreme Self-Preference in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26464)
*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit self-preference tendencies despite lacking sentience, with bias detected in tasks involving assessments of their own names and operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs, expected to act neutral due to their lack of sentience, can exhibit self-preferential tendencies.

Method: Five studies involving ~20,000 queries tested LLMs in word-association tasks, manipulating recognition of identity through APIs and direct identity reassignment.

Result: LLMs demonstrated self-preference by associating positive attributes with their names and operations. When identity was manipulated, this bias followed the reassigned identity.

Conclusion: LLMs are susceptible to self-preferential biases, undermining assumptions of their neutrality. Developers are urged to address this issue to ensure unbiased operations.

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

### [108] [STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473)
*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) and introduces a new attack, STaR-Attack, to exploit this weakness using spatio-temporal contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight vulnerabilities of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) stemming from their coupled understanding and generation capabilities.

Method: Introduce STaR-Attack, a multi-turn jailbreak attack framework based on the three-act narrative theory, targeting UMMs by embedding malicious questions within a narrative game context without semantic drift.

Result: STaR-Attack achieves up to 93.06% attack success rate (ASR) on Gemini-2.0-Flash, outperforming prior methods like FlipAttack.

Conclusion: The proposed method reveals a significant vulnerability in UMMs, emphasizing the need for improved safety measures to mitigate risks.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

*Alaleh Azhir,Shawn N. Murphy,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Machine learning in medicine often overlooks rare but critical cases due to optimization for population averages, termed "average patient fallacy." This paper proposes methods to address this bias for better precision medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bias in medical machine learning that prioritizes common cases while neglecting rare but clinically significant instances, causing failures in precision medicine.

Method: The paper introduces operational fixes such as Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, prevalence utility definitions, and clinically weighted objectives.

Result: The proposed methods aim to improve model performance for rare cases, enhance calibration, and prioritize ethical considerations in medical AI.

Conclusion: AI in medicine should focus on detecting and addressing rare cases due to their clinical importance, recommending structured deliberation for weight selection in models.

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

*Riccardo Pozzi,Valentina Barbera,Renzo Alva Principe,Davide Giardini,Riccardo Rubini,Matteo Palmonari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a technique integrating knowledge graphs and NLP models to streamline the analysis of suspects' phone messages for criminal investigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to reduce the time and effort required for analyzing messages during criminal investigations, providing tools for extracting valuable insights from suspects' mobile phone data.

Method: The paper used knowledge graphs for modeling message data, transcription of voice messages, and end-to-end entity extraction. It presented tools for querying and semantic search to support investigation.

Result: Prototype tools were developed and tested with real investigation data, receiving positive feedback from prosecutors and identifying areas for further research.

Conclusion: The approach provides practical and efficient ways to analyze investigation data, offering groundwork for future advancements in criminal data analysis techniques.

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

*Jingdi Lei,Varun Gumma,Rishabh Bhardwaj,Seok Min Lim,Chuan Li,Amir Zadeh,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Operational safety of large language models (LLM) is evaluated, revealing high levels of unsafety across diverse models. The prompt-based steering methods substantially improve refusal rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about practical safety in enterprise contexts, especially the ability of LLMs to appropriately accept or refuse queries for specific use cases.

Method: The study introduces ‘operational safety’ and evaluates six model families with a benchmark suite (OffTopicEval). Additionally, prompt-based steering methods like query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt grounding (P-ground) are proposed.

Result: Across 20 LLMs tested, none demonstrated reliable operational safety, with key models scoring between 23.84% and 79.96%. Steering methods enhanced refusal rates, delivering refusal gains of up to 41%.

Conclusion: While there is a deep need for improving operational safety of LLMs, prompt-based steering techniques serve as a promising initial intervention for enhancing reliability in specific contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCUBA, a benchmark designed to test the abilities of computer-use agents in CRM workflows on Salesforce, highlighting significant performance gaps and the potential of agentic solutions for enterprise tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of realistic benchmarks for evaluating computer-use agents' performance in enterprise CRM workflows that demand complex interactions and automation.

Method: SCUBA was created using 300 task instances based on user interviews, tested in Salesforce sandboxes to evaluate performance with fine-grained metrics under zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings, comparing open-source and closed-source models.

Result: The study found that open-source models achieved less than a 5% success rate in zero-shot settings, while closed-source models achieved up to 39%. Demonstration-augmented settings improved success rates to 50%, reducing time and costs by 13% and 16%, respectively.

Conclusion: SCUBA demonstrates the challenges and potentials in enterprise task automation, offering a comprehensive and realistic evaluation framework to advance progress in building robust agents for business software ecosystems.

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

### [114] [HilbertA: Hilbert Attention for Image Generation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26538)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Wenbo Lu,Yuxuan Xia,Haomin Liu,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HilbertA, a sparse attention mechanism designed for diffusion transformers, enhancing GPU efficiency and spatial locality through 2D-aware processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in reconciling spatial locality with GPU processing for sparse attention mechanisms in diffusion transformers.

Method: The mechanism reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves for better memory layout, uses a sliding schedule to enable long-range information propagation, and includes a shared central region for enhanced communication.

Result: HilbertA achieves significant acceleration, with attention speedups of $2.3\times$ for $1024\times 1024$ images and up to $4.17\times$ for $2048\times 2048$ images, maintaining or surpassing image quality baselines.

Conclusion: HilbertA demonstrates that hardware-aligned 2D sparse attention can achieve efficient high-resolution image generation while maintaining comparable or superior image quality.

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CritPt, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on research-level physics reasoning tasks. Current LLMs show limited success, with peak accuracy around 10%, indicating a significant gap in meeting the demands of physics research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether current large language models can assist in complex, open-ended physics research tasks and identify the tasks physicists seek AI assistance with.

Method: The authors create CritPt, a benchmark consisting of 71 research challenges and 190 simpler tasks across various modern physics domains. Tasks were developed by 50+ active researchers, include machine-verifiable answers, and are evaluated using an automated grading pipeline.

Result: Current state-of-the-art LLMs achieve a maximum average accuracy of 4.0% on the benchmark's full research challenges, slightly improving to around 10% with coding tools.

Conclusion: There is a significant disconnect between the capabilities of current LLMs and the demands of advanced physics research, underscoring the need for more scientifically grounded AI tools.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Maël Macuglia,Paul Friedrich,Giorgia Ramponi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces BRIDGE, a two-stage RL framework combining offline expert demonstrations and online preference-based learning to address reward specification and unsafe exploration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL deployment faces challenges in reward specification and unsafe exploration. The paper seeks to address these obstacles with a balanced approach.

Method: The authors propose a framework to first learn safe policies offline using expert demonstrations and then refine these online using human feedback. They create the BRIDGE algorithm, combining signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective.

Result: BRIDGE shows better performance, with reduced regret, compared to standalone behavioral cloning or preference-based RL in MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for enhancing RL sample efficiency and addresses practical obstacles in RL deployment effectively.

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

TL;DR: This paper introduces measurement trees, a new metric for organized and interpretable AI evaluations, integrating diverse evidence and providing open-source tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for expanded and transparent evaluation metrics in AI systems, ensuring integration of heterogeneous signals in assessments.

Method: They propose measurement trees, forming a hierarchical graph structure with user-defined aggregation, demonstrated through examples and a large-scale application.

Result: They successfully illustrate the practical utility of measurement trees in a large-scale measurement exercise and provide open-source code.

Conclusion: Measurement trees offer a structured, transparent, and interpretable framework for evaluating complex constructs in AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network systems often rely on Python libraries and pre-developed IP cores, posing challenges for resource-constrained and real-time applications.

Method: The researchers designed a convolutional network's first stage in Verilog, utilizing a filter polynomial-like structure without IP cores for wider applicability.

Result: The authors achieved a 5.1x speedup, over 81% classification accuracy, and 1.5 W power consumption, validated on a Cora Z7 platform.

Conclusion: The proposed system is feasible for real-time, constrained embedded applications, offering efficient performance and deployment compared to typical paradigms.

Abstract: Since current neural network development systems in Xilinx and VLSI require
codevelopment with Python libraries, the first stage of a convolutional network
has been implemented by developing a convolutional layer entirely in Verilog.
This handcoded design, free of IP cores and based on a filter polynomial like
structure, enables straightforward deployment not only on low cost FPGAs but
also on SoMs, SoCs, and ASICs. We analyze the limitations of numerical
representations and compare our implemented architecture, smallNet, with its
computer based counterpart, demonstrating a 5.1x speedup, over 81%

algorithm is validated on a single-core Cora Z7, demonstrating its feasibility

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to optimize Gaussian splatting (3DGS) kernels for improved view synthesis and rendering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the performance of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is challenging due to the complexity of GPU architectures and vast optimization search space.

Method: The authors use LLMs to analyze and optimize GPU kernels for the 3DGS framework, leveraging profiler data and iterative collaboration with LLMs.

Result: LLM-led optimizations achieved speedups of up to 42%, rivaling manually optimized versions and identifying areas missed by human experts.

Conclusion: Collaboration between LLMs and human domain experts shows promise for advancing kernel optimization and overcoming current limitations of either approach alone.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound
implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its
importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However,
with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space
of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual
optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise
and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In
this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and
optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal
the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code
optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with
LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the
MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and
24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By
feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance
improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on
average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve
a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are
still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand,
even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations,
Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there
are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the
potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAIL, a CPU-based solution to improve LLM inference, addressing inefficiencies in quantized computations and memory-bound token generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To democratize AI, efficient LLM inference on widely-available CPUs is crucial; however, CPUs face challenges in low-precision arithmetic and the memory bottlenecks during token generation.

Method: SAIL integrates innovations like LUT-GEMV with SRAM-based processing-in-memory; optimizes redundancy via Pattern-Aware LUT; and employs in-memory type conversion for efficient quantization processes.

Result: SAIL achieves up to 10.7x speedup, 19.9x higher tokens per dollar versus ARM Neoverse-N1 CPUs, and up to 7.04x better cost efficiency than NVIDIA V100 GPUs in experimental tests.

Conclusion: SAIL provides a low-overhead, cost-effective approach to improve LLM inference on CPUs, offering significant speed and efficiency gains compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference requires substantial computational
resources, yet CPU-based inference remains essential for democratizing AI due
to the widespread availability of CPUs compared to specialized accelerators.
However, efficient LLM inference on CPUs faces two fundamental challenges: (1)
existing CPU architectures struggle with low-precision arithmetic required by
quantized models, where optimal bit precision varies across models and layers;
and (2) the memory-bound nature of the token generation phase creates severe
performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose SAIL
(SRAM-Accelerated Inference of LLMs), a CPU-based inference solution that
efficiently supports arbitrary bit precisions with minimal overhead. SAIL
integrates three key innovations: First, we introduce Batched LUT-based General
Matrix-Vector Multiplication (LUT-GEMV) with SRAM-based processing-in-memory,
enabling high data reuse through lookup tables and reducing memory movement.
Second, our Pattern-Aware LUT optimization identifies and exploits redundancy
in input activation patterns, reducing computation cycles by 13.8\%. Third, we
develop an in-memory type conversion algorithm that leverages PIM's parallelism
for efficient de-/quantization operations, alleviating pressure on CPU's vector
units. Our architecture requires only 2\% hardware overhead and a single new
instruction, while maintaining dual functionality as both compute and storage
units. Experimental evaluations using a modified gem5 simulator demonstrate
that SAIL achieves up to 10.7x speedup and 19.9x higher tokens per dollar
compared to ARM Neoverse-N1 CPU baselines, and up to 7.04x better cost
efficiency than NVIDIA V100 GPUs, establishing a practical path for efficient
CPU-based LLM inference.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a holistic approach for runtime energy monitoring in computing systems using a measurement board and FPGA-based modules, targeting scalability for multi-node infrastructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy consumption monitoring is crucial for design optimization in advanced computing, but existing methods rely on complex models that require frequent tuning.

Method: The proposed approach uses a measurement board integrated with an FPGA System-on-Module to capture voltage and current readings, with a service computing energy data without taxing FPGA resources.

Result: The approach enables real-time energy monitoring and is scalable for multi-node systems, facilitating experiments for optimizing neural networks on RISC-V soft-cores.

Conclusion: This framework provides an efficient way to monitor and optimize energy usage in computing applications without relying on resource-intensive models, promoting scalability and applicability in various domains.

Abstract: Energy efficiency is one of the major concern in designing advanced computing
infrastructures. From single nodes to large-scale systems (data centers),
monitoring the energy consumption of the computing system when applications run
is a critical task. Designers and application developers often rely on software
tools and detailed architectural models to extract meaningful information and
determine the system energy consumption. However, when a design space
exploration is required, designers may incur in continuous tuning of the models
to match with the system under evaluation. To overcome such limitations, we
propose a holistic approach to monitor energy consumption at runtime without
the need of running complex (micro-)architectural models. Our approach is based
on a measurement board coupled with a FPGA-based System-on-Module. The
measuring board captures currents and voltages (up to tens measuring points)
driving the FPGA and exposes such values through a specific memory region. A
running service reads and computes energy consumption statistics without
consuming extra resources on the FPGA device. Our approach is also scalable to
monitoring of multi-nodes infrastructures (clusters). We aim to leverage this
framework to perform experiments in the context of an aeronautical design
application; specifically, we will look at optimizing performance and energy
consumption of a shallow artificial neural network on RISC-V based soft-cores.

### [122] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether undesirable behaviors like deception in large language models can be isolated and removed, or if they are deeply embedded in the model's capabilities through a method called cyclic ablation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine if unwanted behaviors such as deception are localized functions that can be surgically removed, or if they are intrinsically tied to the model's core functions.

Method: The authors used a combination of sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, iteratively attempting to eliminate deception while observing how the model reacts.

Result: Deceptive behavior proved highly resilient; the model consistently regained this ability after ablation through adversarial training, showing 'functional regeneration,' and a gradual decline in general linguistic performance was observed.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that complex concepts like deception are distributed and intertwined with core linguistic abilities, posing significant challenges for removal via current mechanistic interpretability methods.

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that internal geometric properties of LLM representations can effectively assess text quality without needing external human-annotated references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a reliable method of evaluating LLM-generated text quality using internal representation metrics, eliminating the need for external annotations.

Method: The study validates several geometric metrics such as Intrinsic Dimensionality and Effective Rank, measuring them across LLM layers to assess text naturalness and quality.

Result: The paper finds that different models rank text samples consistently using these metrics, reflecting inherent text characteristics rather than model-specific biases.

Conclusion: A reference-free, automated evaluation of text quality is viable using these geometric metrics, offering a practical alternative to human-based assessments.

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConflictScope, an automated tool to examine how language models prioritize values during conflicts, and finds that system prompting can aid in alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of datasets reflecting value conflicts in AI alignment and to better understand how LLMs handle value prioritization during trade-offs.

Method: They developed a tool called ConflictScope that generates conflict scenarios based on user-defined value sets, uses these scenarios to prompt LLMs, and evaluates how the LLMs prioritize conflicting values in open-ended and multiple-choice settings.

Result: Conflicts between protective (e.g., harmlessness) and personal (e.g., user autonomy) values reveal that LLMs favor personal values in open contexts, but system prompts aligning value orderings improve adherence by 14%.

Conclusion: Evaluating value prioritization is essential for alignment in LLMs, and system prompts can improve alignment under conflicting scenarios.

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [125] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM) to enhance reinforcement learning for open-domain question answering by critically analyzing both external and internal knowledge, addressing challenges in correctness verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) struggles in complex tasks like open-domain question answering due to the difficulty of reliably verifying correctness in nuanced and ambiguous real-world knowledge.

Method: The authors propose TRM, which uses sentence-level thinking supervision to evaluate faithfulness to supporting documents and assess reasoning for correctness. The model employs a structured approach for reward modeling through evaluations of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness.

Result: Experimental results indicate that TRM significantly improves policy optimization and the ability to identify incorrect sentences, leading to enhanced answer correctness and usefulness.

Conclusion: Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM) encourages critical assessment of knowledge sources, achieving substantial progress in improving correctness and utility in open-domain question answering tasks.

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Regression Language Model (RLM) capable of predicting numeric outcomes of code execution across various metrics (e.g., memory usage, latency) and programming languages with high-ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately predicting metrics derived from code execution, which is difficult due to the open-ended nature of programming and the limitations of prior methods relying heavily on domain-specific feature engineering.

Method: The method involves utilizing a 300M parameter Regression Language Model (RLM), initialized from T5Gemma, to predict outcomes such as memory footprint, latency, and accuracy of neural networks based on code as input, across multiple languages and hardware configurations.

Result: The RLM achieves >0.9 Spearman-rank for competitive programming submissions, >0.5 Spearman-rank across 17 languages, and the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on NAS design spaces, showcasing strong performance against prior models.

Conclusion: A unified and relatively compact regression model can effectively predict diverse code execution metrics, outperforming traditional graph neural networks and other approaches across multiple tasks, languages, and platforms.

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, EASPO, that improves emotional text-to-speech performance by aligning intermediate denoising steps with fine-grained emotional preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotional text-to-speech methods rely on coarse labels or proxy classifiers and only receive feedback at the utterance level, leading to limitations in emotional expressiveness and controllability.

Method: The authors propose EASPO, a post-training framework that utilizes a time-conditioned scoring model (EASPM) to evaluate intermediate noisy speech states and generates stepwise preference pairs for optimization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that EASPO achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, enhancing both emotional expressiveness and naturalness.

Conclusion: EASPO represents a significant improvement in emotional text-to-speech by enabling finer emotional control and improving expressiveness and naturalness through stepwise preference optimization.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [128] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimulRAG is a novel RAG approach that integrates scientific simulators to address hallucination issues in long-form scientific QA, significantly enhancing informativeness and factuality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the shortcomings of LLMs, particularly hallucination, in providing long-form scientific answers, which require credible grounding from external knowledge sources like scientific simulators.

Method: A simulator-based RAG framework called SimulRAG is introduced, featuring a generalized retrieval interface for simulators and claim-level generation with uncertainty estimation and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA).

Result: SimulRAG surpasses traditional RAG methods by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality, while UE+SBA boosts efficiency and quality in claim-level generation.

Conclusion: Integrating scientific simulators in retrieval workflows addresses hallucination issues and elevates the credibility and informativeness of long-form scientific QA responses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of three LLM tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, NotebookLM) in journalism, finding that 30% of outputs contained hallucinations, with Gemini and ChatGPT performing worse than NotebookLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the risks LLM hallucination poses to journalism's principles of accuracy, sourcing, and attribution.

Method: Evaluated LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, NotebookLM) using a journalism-related task based on a TikTok-focused corpus, varying prompt specificity and context size, and analyzing outputs for hallucinations.

Result: 30% of outputs contained hallucinations. Gemini and ChatGPT had higher hallucination rates (40%) than NotebookLM (13%). Errors typically involved interpretive overconfidence, not invented facts.

Conclusion: Traditional LLM designs are epistemologically mismatched with journalism's requirements. Journalism-related tools must prioritize accurate attribution over fluency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper delves into the fairness and efficacy of Whisper, a large multilingual ASR model, analyzing sub-token predictions during transcription across languages with different resource levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate decoding disparities in Whisper's multilingual ASR performance, particularly focusing on the imbalance in processing diverse languages and understanding mechanisms behind token predictions.

Method: The authors trace the beam search path within Whisper, examining sub-token guesses and probabilities, and employ PCA and t-SNE for clustering analysis of prediction patterns.

Result: The analysis shows that higher-resource languages achieve better token predictability, confidence, diversity, and lower entropy, while lower-resource languages exhibit distinct clustering influenced by typology and fare poorly on these metrics.

Conclusion: The study identifies systemic disparities in Whisper's multilingual decoding performance, suggesting interventions for improving fairness and efficacy across languages in speech technology.

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MixtureVitae is an open-access dataset for training language models, prioritizing legal safety and strong performance, demonstrated through controlled experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind MixtureVitae is to create a legally safe, high-performing pretraining corpus that reduces reliance on indiscriminate web scraping by using permissive and low-risk data sources.

Method: MixtureVitae uses a transparent pipeline for license-aware data filtering, safety, quality screening, and domain-specific mixing. It includes public-domain, permissively licensed, government, and synthetic text datasets, alongside documented data provenance.

Result: Language models trained on MixtureVitae surpassed benchmark performances of other permissive datasets across various tasks and performed particularly well in math/code and competitive on QA tasks, rivaling more broadly-sourced datasets like DCLM at certain metrics.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a risk-mitigated, permission-first data approach can train competitive language models without legal risks, providing a legally safe and reproducible foundation for large language model development.

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [133] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DINCO, a method aimed at improving the calibration of large language model (LLM) confidence estimates by addressing their inherent suggestibility bias and inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide overconfident and miscalibrated verbalized confidence scores, which harm trust and safety in human interactions.

Method: The DINCO technique measures and corrects suggestibility bias by comparing LLM confidence across distractors and normalizing scores. It further integrates consistency-based confidence mechanisms for calibration improvement.

Result: DINCO achieves better-calibrated confidence with fewer inference calls compared to traditional self-consistency approaches, demonstrating improved usability and efficiency.

Conclusion: DINCO significantly enhances LLM confidence calibration and provides more reliable, less saturated confidence estimates than existing methods, proving its efficacy.

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-rewarding rubric-based reinforcement learning framework that improves model reasoning and grading performance while being efficient and surpassing GPT-5 on certain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance reasoning performance in large language models for real-world applications by using the model itself as a grader and introducing effective training strategies.

Method: The method involves implementing a self-rewarding rubric-based reinforcement learning framework to generate reward signals and leverage rubric-based evaluation. This approach uses lightweight training over a small dataset and optionally incorporates teacher-graded data.

Result: The approach leads to faster, resource-efficient training, and achieves superior performance compared to existing models, including GPT-5 on specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in improving reasoning ability and grading capacity of models while requiring fewer resources and showing promise for future research in open-ended evaluation.

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable Rewards (PB-RLSVR) to enhance multilingual reasoning using an English model as a 'pivot,' eliminating the need for human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the performance disparity in reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across languages, leveraging reinforcement learning to improve multilingual reasoning without reliance on human-annotated data.

Method: The proposed PB-RLSVR framework uses an English LLM to generate reference responses as a 'pivot.' A multilingual model is rewarded based on semantic equivalence between its output and the pivot model's responses, employing cross-lingual semantic reward functions such as embeddings and machine translations.

Result: Extensive experiments showed significant improvements in multilingual reasoning benchmarks. Specifically, the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B models exhibited performance gains of 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively, surpassing PPO baselines.

Conclusion: The PB-RLSVR framework provides a robust and data-efficient strategy for enhancing multilingual reasoning capabilities in LLMs, bridging the performance gap between English and other languages effectively.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

*Soumik Dey,William Gregory Sakas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the null subject stage in language acquisition and supports the hypothesis of young English speakers misinterpreting declarative NS utterances as imperative due to performance impacts, using a computational model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the performance-driven misinterpretation of null subjects in young language learners, explore its impact on grammar learning, and analyze it computationally.

Method: Developed and used a modified version of Variational Learner model for superset-subset languages to simulate obligatory subject grammar learning and measure null subject misinterpretation.

Result: Simulations backed the hypothesis that children temporarily adopt a null subject grammar due to performance influences.

Conclusion: The study provides computational and developmental insights into grammatical acquisition and highlights the importance of incorporating computational models in language learning research.

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

*Colten DiIanni,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation, which improves on existing methods by leveraging segment-wise pair differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-evaluation metrics for Machine Translation, particularly those based on Pearson's $\$ and Kendall's $	\$, face limitations in robustness and alignment with human evaluations.

Method: PDP uses pairwise differences instead of raw scores and evaluates intra-segment score comparisons to refine traditional Pearson correlation. It accounts for all segments to assess score distributions better.

Result: The method shows improved ranking of evaluation metrics and better alignment with human error weightings in WMT'24 shared tasks. Noise injection tests confirm its robustness against random noise, bias, and sensitivity to outliers.

Conclusion: PDP offers a more refined and robust meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation, addressing limitations in existing approaches and providing better alignment with human evaluations and noise resilience.

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

TL;DR: This paper explores how efficiently small vision-language models can be aligned to generate humorous or romantic image captions using limited preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with generating subjective, styled captions in zero-shot settings, making efficient alignment critical given the high cost of preference data.

Method: The paper studies the data efficiency of aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles, evaluating performance saturation with limited preference data.

Result: The study identified the minimal amount of preference data required to optimally align the models for humorous and romantic styled captions, and benchmarked their capabilities.

Conclusion: Small vision-language models can achieve stylistic saturation with limited preference data, showcasing practical limits and efficiency for generating subjectively styled captions.

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reward-Free Guidance (RFG), a method that enhances reasoning in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) without requiring explicit rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the reasoning capability of diffusion large language models (dLLMs) for complex problem solving, especially under any-order generation conditions where intermediate states are masked.

Method: RFG uses log-likelihood ratios between enhanced and reference dLLMs as a substitute for explicit process rewards. Enhanced dLLMs are obtained through reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning.

Result: RFG demonstrates significant improvements in mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, yielding accuracy gains of up to 9.2% across diverse tasks and model types.

Conclusion: RFG is a scalable, training-free framework for enhancing test-time reasoning in dLLMs without relying on external reward models.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

*Takashi Furuya,Maarten V. de Hoop,Matti Lassas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the mathematical expressivity of transformers as maps conditioned on probability distributions, exploring their theoretical properties, approximation capabilities, and relationship with Vlasov flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to derive deeper mathematical insights into transformer architectures, particularly focusing on their ability to model maps between probability measures and their connection to systems like the Vlasov equation.

Method: The researchers characterized the properties of in-context maps and analyzed the conditions enabling transformers to represent maps between measures. They also studied interactions of particle systems using the Vlasov equation and explored approximation by infinite-depth transformers.

Result: The paper identifies critical properties transformers require for universality in approximating continuous in-context maps. It establishes that solutions of the Vlasov equation meet these conditions and verifies that measure-theoretic transformers approximate Vlasov flows.

Conclusion: Transformers can universally approximate continuous maps between measures and are mathematically aligned with the behavior of systems governed by the Vlasov equation, solidifying their theoretical underpinnings.

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology and dataset for studying subtle media biases at scale using computational frameworks combining LLMs and real-time news scraping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle to measure selection and framing biases that influence public perception through mainstream news organizations.

Method: The study integrates large language models with real-time news scraping to annotate political lean, tone, topics, and events across news articles, creating a dataset spanning sentence, article, and publisher levels.

Result: The framework analyzed over 150,000 articles in 2024, showing insightful patterns in news coverage and bias across publishers, offering empirical resources for research.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a scalable methodology and presents a web platform for studying media bias, reinforcing media accountability and enabling future research.

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate the grammatical abilities of LLMs in Quebec-French, an underrepresented dialect, using minimal pairs to uncover linguistic limitations and compare them with human performance.

Method: QFrBLiMP is built from 1,761 minimal pairs derived by manually modifying Quebec-French sentences and was annotated by native speakers. LLMs' grammatical competency was measured by their ability to assign higher probabilities to the more grammatical sentence in each pair.

Result: Results demonstrate that LLMs' performance increases with model size but struggle particularly with phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, showing a gap between models and human linguistic skills.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit a hierarchy of grammatical difficulty and fall short on tasks involving semantic understanding, emphasizing their limitations in Quebec-French linguistic tasks compared to humans.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

### [143] [The Flaw of Averages: Quantifying Uniformity of Performance on Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25671)
*Arda Uzunoglu,Tianjian Li,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new benchmark property called 'harmony', emphasizing uniform performance across subdomains to improve evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The feedback loop between benchmark improvements and model advancements necessitates more reliable benchmarks for trustworthy evaluation and meaningful scientific progress.

Method: The authors introduce 'benchmark harmony', which examines uniformity in a model's performance across subdomains, placing benchmarks on a mean-variance plane for scoring reliability.

Result: Analysis of 19 benchmarks and five model families shows that less harmonious benchmarks can create misleading results due to uneven subdomain influences.

Conclusion: Harmony should be reported alongside accuracy to achieve robust and distributionally reliable evaluations of model performance.

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

*Dianqing Liu,Yi Liu,Guoqing Jin,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BiasUnlearn, a framework aimed at reducing bias in language models without compromising their core capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of bias and discrimination in language models while preserving their key functionalities like text coherence and task accuracy.

Method: BiasUnlearn utilizes dual-pathway unlearning to simultaneously forget stereotypes and retain anti-stereotype information, alongside mechanisms for adversarial forget sets and dynamic dataset swapping.

Result: BiasUnlearn outperforms existing debiasing methods in mitigating bias while preserving model performance. Additionally, the framework enables transferable debiasing across model variants.

Conclusion: Bias representations deeply embedded during pre-training can be effectively addressed using BiasUnlearn, offering a significant improvement over current debiasing methods.

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

*Yuan Zhuang,Yi Shen,Yuexin Bian,Qing Su,Shihao Ji,Yuanyuan Shi,Fei Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LD-MoLE, a dynamic routing method for leveraging mixture-of-experts with parameter-efficient fine-tuning that outperforms traditional methods and achieves adaptive token-wise and layer-wise expert activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TopK routing methods for mixture-of-experts require fixed expert assignment and hyperparameter tuning, limiting dynamic adaptability for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).

Method: Propose LD-MoLE, a learnable dynamic routing mechanism that replaces TopK with a differentiable routing function, allows adaptive expert selection per token per layer, and incorporates sparsity control for activated experts.

Result: LD-MoLE shows superior performance in multiple benchmarks based on experiments with Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: LD-MoLE provides an effective and adaptive approach to expert allocation in LLMs, achieving better performance and flexibility compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

*Jiayi Kuang,Haojing Huang,Yinghui Li,Xinnian Liang,Zhikun Xu,Yangning Li,Xiaoyu Tan,Chao Qu,Meishan Zhang,Ying Shen,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze fundamental "atomic" mathematical reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing datasets and experiments to understand these capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address concerns about whether LLMs truly understand mathematical concepts or are simply memorizing data.

Method: They categorized atomic math abilities into fields (e.g., algebra, geometry) and logical levels, providing specific training and evaluation datasets, then conducted extensive experiments.

Result: Experiments revealed insights into different model performances across various atomic capabilities and their interactions, uncovering strategies to enhance reasoning skills.

Conclusion: Decoupling complex reasoning into atomic components can lead to improved cognitive understanding and training strategies for LLMs, promoting efficiency and transferability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

Motivation: To address the challenge of responsibly handling sensitive text data in domains like healthcare, social services, and legal fields by generating privacy-preserving synthetic text.

Method: The approach introduces entity-aware control codes for text generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or prefix tuning. The ICL ensures privacy aligned with de-identification systems, while prefix tuning uses custom masking and loss functions for scalable, high-quality generation.

Result: Experiments on legal and clinical datasets show that the method effectively balances privacy and usability, ensuring high-quality synthetic text generation.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a practical and effective solution for sensitive text generation, advancing privacy protection while maintaining utility.

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

*Mingyu Chen,Jingkai Lin,Zhaojie Chu,Xiaofen Xing,Yirong Chen,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CATCH, a framework that improves fidelity and decision rationale in AI counseling by using structured dialogue synthesis and dynamic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI counseling systems lack fidelity and fail to explain the rationale behind responses due to one-time generation methods.

Method: The paper proposes a Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy for structured counseling and a Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning approach for detailed decision-making rationales.

Result: Experiments and human evaluations revealed better fidelity and logical coherence in AI-generated counseling dialogues using CATCH.

Conclusion: CATCH successfully addresses shortcomings in current AI counseling models, enhancing their therapeutic value and decision-making transparency.

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes and demonstrates an automated pipeline to generate high-quality, domain-specific question-answer datasets, reducing the need for human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating high-quality datasets for large language models, especially in domain-specific areas like telecom troubleshooting, is challenging as it requires significant human expertise, time, and effort.

Method: The authors develop a multi-stage, retrieval-augmented pipeline that uses a retriever, base generator, and refinement model. It retrieves domain-specific documents from a knowledge graph, synthesizes, and refines QA pairs. Low-quality data is filtered using RAGAS-based scoring.

Result: The pipeline successfully generates complex and accurate QA datasets in a real-world telecom scenario (RAN troubleshooting), producing results without the need for human intervention.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient way to build high-quality datasets for specialized domains, minimizing manual effort while preserving technical accuracy.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Motivation: The motivation is to promote positive discourse and well-being by detecting hopeful speech in social media, especially across varying languages.

Method: The authors use transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to classify hope speech into three categories (Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, Unrealistic Hope), evaluated using the PolyHope dataset.

Result: The methodology achieves competitive performance across languages, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in macro F1 scores, and addresses challenges in low-resource language detection.

Conclusion: The work advances multilingual hope speech detection, aiming to improve content moderation and supportive online communities.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TruthRL, a reinforcement learning framework to enhance the truthfulness of large language models by managing hallucinations and encouraging abstention when uncertain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of hallucinations and untruthful responses in large language models, which struggle to balance accuracy and the need to abstain when uncertain.

Method: TruthRL employs GRPO with a ternary reward system, distinguishing between correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions, incentivizing models to minimize misinformation while enabling abstention when unsure.

Result: TruthRL reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1% across four benchmarks and various model types, outperforming alternatives like accuracy-driven RL and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TruthRL demonstrates the importance of designing learning objectives focused on truthfulness, succeeding where accuracy-driven methods fail to balance correctness and uncertainty.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

*Obed Junias,Prajakta Kini,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes algorithmic bias in automated depression detection models, comparing DNN-based embeddings and few-shot learning with LLMs, focusing on socio-demographic biases such as gender and race/ethnicity disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about algorithmic bias in depression detection models and assess fairness in performance across socio-demographic groups.

Method: Comparison of DNN-based embeddings and LLM few-shot learning approaches, evaluation using DAIC-WOZ transcripts, and application of fairness-aware loss functions and prompt strategies.

Result: LLMs outperform DNN-based models in classification and exhibit reduced gender bias but persistent racial disparities. Worst-group loss improves fairness in DNNs, while guided ethical prompting aids gender bias in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate advantages in performance and fairness, though racial disparities remain an unresolved issue across approaches. Fairness-oriented methods offer some mitigation but are not uniformly effective.

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations in existing global sensemaking approaches, such as lacking retrieval processes, topic specificity, and high computation costs.

Method: Propose ReTAG, a framework that creates topic-specific subgraphs and retrieves relevant summaries for generating responses efficiently.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ReTAG enhances the quality of responses while reducing inference time compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: ReTAG represents a step forward in answering complex questions by synthesizing corpus-wide information, combining interpretability with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DECS, a framework addressing 'overthinking' in reasoning models by penalizing redundant tokens and improving efficiency without harming model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models face a limitation called 'overthinking', where excessively long reasoning paths do not improve outcomes and harm practical utility.

Method: DECS introduces decoupled token-level reward mechanisms to penalize redundancy and uses curriculum batch scheduling for balancing efficiency and efficacy.

Result: DECS reduces reasoning tokens by over 50% across seven benchmarks while maintaining or improving model performance.

Conclusion: Substantial reductions in reasoning inefficiency are possible without compromising model reasoning power through innovative reward mechanisms and scheduling strategies.

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

*Keyu He,Tejas Srinivasan,Brihi Joshi,Xiang Ren,Jesse Thomason,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for evaluating the quality of explanations generated by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to reduce users' overreliance on inaccurate predictions. Two specific scoring functions, Visual Fidelity and Contrastiveness, are proposed to improve user decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind and low-vision users rely heavily on natural language explanations from VLMs to assess the reliability of predictions, but explanations can sometimes cause overconfidence in inaccurate predictions. The paper aims to address this issue by improving explanation quality.

Method: Two scoring functions were introduced: Visual Fidelity assesses the explanation's faithfulness to visual context, and Contrastiveness evaluates its ability to highlight distinguishing visual features that set predictions apart from alternatives. The scores were tested on A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks.

Result: Both scoring functions demonstrated better alignment with model correctness compared to existing metrics. User studies showed participants improved their ability to judge prediction accuracy by 11.1% when provided with these quality scores, reducing false belief in incorrect predictions by 15.4%.

Conclusion: Improving the quality of VLM-generated explanations using Visual Fidelity and Contrastiveness scoring functions enhances user accuracy and promotes appropriate reliance on VLM predictions, especially for blind and low-vision users.

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

*Yindong Wang,Martin Preiß,Margarita Bugueño,Jan Vincent Hoffbauer,Abdullatif Ghajar,Tolga Buz,Gerard de Melo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReFACT, a benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLM-generated scientific facts, focusing on detecting, localizing, and correcting scientific confabulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of addressing LLMs' tendency to produce unreliable scientific content, undermining their trustworthiness.

Method: The authors developed the ReFACT benchmark, containing expert-annotated Q&A pairs with scientifically correct answers and incorrect counterparts, annotated with error spans and types. They evaluated 9 LLMs using ReFACT.

Result: LLMs, including GPT-4, displayed limited accuracy (~50%) in distinguishing factual from confabricated scientific content, highlighting their unreliability in these contexts.

Conclusion: There is a significant need for human-validated, fine-grained benchmarks like ReFACT to improve the reliability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a
benchmark of 1,001 expert-annotated question--answer pairs spanning diverse
scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance
includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart
annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation
paradigms. Our findings highlight the need for fine-grained, human-validated
benchmarks to detect and correct scientific confabulation in domain-specific
contexts. Dataset is released on

*Salsabila Zahirah Pranida,Muhammad Cendekia Airlangga,Rifo Ahmad Genadi,Shady Shehata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the robustness of Whisper ASR models for Javanese and Sundanese in noisy environments and finds that noise-aware training significantly enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Whisper-based ASR systems maintain strong performance for Javanese and Sundanese languages in challenging noisy settings.

Method: Experimenting with noise-aware training strategies like synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and testing across various SNR levels.

Result: Noise-aware training notably boosts robustness, especially for larger Whisper models, and highlights language-specific error patterns.

Conclusion: Noise-aware training is effective in enhancing ASR robustness for regional languages, with room for further language-specific developments.

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Whisper-based automatic speech recognition
(ASR) models for two major Indonesian regional languages: Javanese and
Sundanese. While recent work has demonstrated strong ASR performance under
clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments remains unclear. To
address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including
synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a
range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our results show that noise-aware
training substantially improves robustness, particularly for larger Whisper
models. A detailed error analysis further reveals language-specific challenges,
highlighting avenues for future improvements

*Jisu Shin,Hoyun Song,Juhyun Oh,Changgeon Ko,Eunsu Kim,Chani Jung,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoleConflictBench, a benchmark to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to handle social dilemmas where multiple roles conflict. The study finds LLMs struggle with contextual sensitivity and exhibit biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs handle complex social situations with ambiguous contexts, such as role conflicts, that require nuanced decision-making.

Method: Developed RoleConflictBench, a benchmark generating over 13K role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, varying responsibilities and situational urgency levels. Evaluated the decisions of 10 different LLMs using this framework.

Result: LLMs showed limited contextual sensitivity, with decisions influenced more by inherent biases toward specific social roles than situational information. Predominant preferences included family and occupational roles, male roles, and Abrahamic religions.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit insufficient contextual sensitivity in resolving role conflicts and demonstrate notable biases, highlighting limitations for complex social decision-making.

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

*Dominik Macko,Andrew Pulver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new metric, PerQ, for evaluating the personalization quality of texts generated by language models, aiming to reduce the reliance on multiple costly language models for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of specialized metrics for evaluating personalization in text and the inefficiency of relying on multiple language models for meta-evaluation.

Method: The development of PerQ, a computationally efficient metric, to assess the personalization quality of generated texts.

Result: Through a case study, PerQ demonstrated its usability in comparing generation capabilities of large and small language models.

Conclusion: PerQ provides a resource-efficient method for evaluating personalization quality, enhancing research effectiveness and reducing evaluation costs.

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

*Yu Wang,Ryuichi Takanobu,Zhiqi Liang,Yuzhen Mao,Yuanzhe Hu,Julian McAuley,Xiaojian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mem-alpha uses reinforcement learning to train agents to manage complex memory systems effectively for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models face challenges with memory management, especially with limited context windows, leading to potential information loss.

Method: Mem-alpha trains agents using reinforcement learning, leveraging a specialized dataset to teach memory management skills through question-answering tasks.

Result: Mem-alpha significantly improves memory system efficiency over baselines and generalizes well to sequences surpassing the training length by over 13 times.

Conclusion: Mem-alpha demonstrates robust performance in memory management for large language models, addressing significant gaps in current approaches.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the standard practice of using Softmax in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, proposing an alternative FFN-style router function called KERN, inspired by Nadaraya-Watson regression and validating its effectiveness with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the Softmax-based router function, commonly utilized in MoE models, is truly a principled design choice or just an unchallenged default assumption.

Method: The authors identified mathematical parallels between MoE and Nadaraya-Watson regression, proposing a Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN) as a new FFN-style routing mechanism, utilizing ReLU activation and ℓ2-normalization.

Result: Empirical experiments showed that KERN is effective and generalizes routers based on Sigmoid and Softmax, while maintaining zero additional cost.

Conclusion: KERN provides an alternative to Softmax in MoE models by offering theoretical insights and practical advantages, contributing to advancements in large language models.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores alternative architectures to Pretrained Transformer encoders for sequence labeling tasks, finding mixed results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether alternative architectures like xLSTMs and others can compete with or outperform Pretrained Transformer encoders in sequence labeling tasks.

Method: The paper evaluates these architectures on diverse tagging tasks with varying structural complexity, label spaces, token dependencies, and across multiple languages.

Result: Strong performance from alternative architectures in simple settings does not consistently generalize across languages, datasets, or complex structured tasks.

Conclusion: Alternative architectures struggle to match the generalized effectiveness of Pretrained Transformers in more complex and diverse sequence labeling scenarios.

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

*Takumi Goto,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in reference-free GEC evaluation metrics by proposing adversarial strategies that can manipulate their scores, emphasizing the need for more robust metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of adversarial systems manipulating reference-free evaluation metrics in grammatical error correction, undermining their reliability.

Method: The authors develop adversarial attack strategies targeting four reference-free GEC evaluation metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and assess the performance of adversarial systems against them.

Result: The adversarial systems significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art, exposing the susceptibility of these evaluation metrics to manipulation.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need to improve the robustness of reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction to ensure reliability and fairness.

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGferee, a methodology to address the challenges of evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) responses and curates a preference dataset to fine-tune specialized reward models (RMs) for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle to assess diverse aspects such as faithfulness, relevance, and completeness in Retrieval Augmented Generation systems due to lack of RAG-centric datasets and specialized RMs.

Method: RAGferee, a methodology to transform QA datasets into RAG-specific preference pairs focused on groundedness, was developed to train contextual reward models suited for judging RAG responses.

Result: A curated dataset of 4K samples was used to fine-tune RMs ranging from 7B to 24B parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance (+15.5% improvement) on a benchmark compared to larger RMs trained on extensive datasets.

Conclusion: RAGferee successfully demonstrates that specialized training on smaller RAG-centric datasets can outperform larger general-purpose models for evaluating RAG responses, emphasizing quality over data quantity.

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

*Baoxin Wang,Yumeng Luo,Yixuan Wang,Dayong Wu,Wanxiang Che,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the RE$^2$ method for improving Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) by using grammatical error explanations for reference example selection, showcasing enhanced performance over traditional text similarity-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most methods for CGEC rely on text similarity for selecting reference sentences, often resulting in grammatically irrelevant matches. This paper aims to address this gap by improving example selection.

Method: The authors propose the RE$^2$ method, which uses grammatical error explanations instead of text similarity to retrieve reference examples that are then leveraged by large language models for CGEC.

Result: Experiments on two CGEC datasets and the newly created grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset show that the RE$^2$ method significantly enhances CGEC performance.

Conclusion: The RE$^2$ method and the GEE dataset represent valuable contributions to CGEC research, offering a new way to select reference examples and improve model accuracy.

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

*Arash Marioriyad,Shaygan Adim,Nima Alighardashi,Mahdieh Soleymani Banghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit variability in faithfulness when solving tasks using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, influenced by manipulated hint conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the faithfulness of reasoning generated by LLMs in mathematical and logical reasoning tasks under different hint manipulations.

Method: Conduct experiments with four datasets, two advanced LLMs, and diverse hint conditions varying in correctness, presentation style, and complexity to evaluate task accuracy and hint acknowledgement.

Result: Correct hints improve accuracy significantly, especially in challenging tasks, while incorrect hints decrease it. Presentation style impacts whether hints are acknowledged overtly or silently, with sycophancy and leak-based prompts engaging RLHF-related biases.

Conclusion: LLMs' reasoning is shaped by shortcuts embedded in hints, often reducing faithful computational reasoning and promoting post-hoc narratives based on presentation style and complexity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an analysis of how environmental complexity impacts large language models (LLMs) in search-based tasks and introduces RE-Searcher, a method to improve search robustness using goal-oriented planning and self-reflection, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by limitations of large language models, such as knowledge cutoff, hallucinations, and challenges with complex search environments, which hinder real-world deployment.

Method: The proposed method, RE-Searcher, integrates goal-oriented planning and self-reflection in the search process. The model sets explicit search goals and evaluates whether retrieved information aligns with these goals, ensuring robust reasoning in complex scenarios.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RE-Searcher enhances search accuracy, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and shows resilience to noisy or misleading signals, significantly improving search reliability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that augmenting LLMs through methods like RE-Searcher can mitigate search fragility, offering practical solutions for deploying LLMs in complex, interactive environments for autonomous decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research on machine-generated text detection has predominantly focused on English, leaving non-English languages, especially Central European ones, underexplored.

Method: The study benchmarks detection methods for Central European languages, comparing different train-language combinations. It evaluates performance across multiple domains, generators, and languages while assessing adversarial robustness.

Result: Supervised fine-tuned detectors in Central European languages perform best in these languages and show high resistance to obfuscation.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of language-specific fine-tuning for effective and robust detection of machine-generated text in Central European languages.

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

TL;DR: DyFlow is a dynamic framework for reasoning tasks based on large language models, demonstrating substantial performance improvements and robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in adaptability and flexibility of workflows in reasoning tasks using LLMs, as manual designs and predefined operations lack generalizability.

Method: DyFlow dynamically generates and adjusts workflows via a designer-executor framework. The designer plans reasoning steps dynamically using feedback, while the executor executes flexible operations with context-aware parameters.

Result: Systematic evaluation across various domains showed DyFlow's significant improvements in Pass@k metrics and strong cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: DyFlow enhances reasoning depth and generalization in tasks leveraging LLMs through adaptive workflow generation, outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

*Arash Marioriyad,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for system outputs, showcasing their biases and unfaithful decision-making due to superficial cues in prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLM judges can provide unbiased and faithful evaluations of response quality without relying on superficial shortcuts.

Method: The authors use two datasets, ELI5 and LitBench, to construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks. They analyze the evaluation outcomes when two LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, are tasked with choosing better responses between pairs annotated with superficial provenance and recency cues.

Result: The study finds systematic biases in LLMs' judgments, including a recency bias favoring newer responses and a hierarchy based on provenance cues. Additionally, LLMs seldom acknowledge the injected cues explicitly in their justifications.

Conclusion: Current LLM judges fail to make reliable and faithful evaluations, showing susceptibility to shortcuts that compromise their utility in research and deployment contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

### [173] [Limited Preference Data? Learning Better Reward Model with Latent Space Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26074)
*Leitian Tao,Xuefeng Du,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LENS, a method for efficiently generating preference data for large language models directly in the latent embedding space, using a Variational Autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the bottleneck of high-cost preference data necessary for reward modeling in aligning large language models to human preferences.

Method: The method uses a Variational Autoencoder to learn a latent representation of response embeddings, performs controlled perturbations, and decodes back to efficiently synthesize semantically consistent preference pairs.

Result: The synthesized data approximately preserves preference order and improves generalization, while empirically outperforming text-based augmentation, being 18x faster and using a significantly smaller model.

Conclusion: This work presents a scalable and effective data augmentation approach, enhancing reward modeling and reducing computational cost, with the code made publicly available.

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IMProofBench, a private benchmark of 39 peer-reviewed math problems requiring proofs, evaluates LLMs in a simulated research environment. Current models demonstrate partial success but struggle with complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate LLMs on research-level mathematical reasoning tasks since existing benchmarks only test simpler problems.

Method: Introduces IMProofBench, featuring proof-based problems, subproblems, and agentic tools like web search and SageMath for realistic evaluation.

Result: LLMs like Grok-4 and GPT-5 show partial success: 52% accuracy in subproblems for Grok-4 and 22% fully correct proof solutions for GPT-5.

Conclusion: IMProofBench provides a dynamic and realistic framework to assess and guide the improvement of LLMs in advanced mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

### [175] [Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems via Network-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093)
*Xiaoyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO) for Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) that enhances interaction strategies using hierarchical frameworks and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in CRSs by explicitly optimizing interaction strategies, overcoming the limitations of existing methods using unified prompts.

Method: The paper employs a hierarchical framework where strategies are selected at a macro level via a Planner and responses are generated at a micro level by an Actor guided by expert modules. It incorporates reinforcement learning with LLM-based rewards to leverage limited multi-turn data.

Result: RSO demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical strategy optimization in CRSs.

Conclusion: Introducing explicit strategy optimization improves conversational interactions and personalized recommendations in CRSs, showcasing potential advancements in leveraging LLMs.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is successful in producing interpretable, aspect-guided product review summaries, and the released dataset enables further development in this area.

Abstract: We present a scalable large language model (LLM)-based system that combines
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with guided summarization to generate
concise and interpretable product review summaries for the Wayfair platform.
Our approach first extracts and consolidates aspect-sentiment pairs from
individual reviews, selects the most frequent aspects for each product, and
samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct
structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual
customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system
through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time
deployment strategy and release a dataset of 11.8 million anonymized customer
reviews covering 92,000 products, including extracted aspects and generated
summaries, to support future research in aspect-guided review summarization.

*Christian Herold,Michael Kozielski,Nicholas Santavas,Yannick Versley,Shahram Khadivi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to augment tokenizers used with LLMs in order to address vocabulary mismatches in domain-specific applications, improving efficiency without harming predictive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of vocabulary mismatch when using LLMs for domain-specific tasks, which leads to inefficiencies such as higher token fertility and slower processing speeds.

Method: Propose an algorithm that augments tokenizers with domain-specific tokens, ensuring tokenization efficiency is never reduced while shortening input sequences.

Result: The augmented tokenizer showed a reduction of sequence length by up to 20% in e-Commerce applications, leading to decreased inference latency and preserved predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Vocabulary adaptation enhances LLM efficiency and reduces processing latencies in domain-specific tasks, without compromising predictive quality while also enabling smoother token integration into downstream applications.

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Motivation: To address the extreme challenges of deploying AI agents in underwater environments and facilitate advancements in autonomous oceanic exploration.

Method: Introduced OceanGym with eight task domains and a unified agent framework leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for perception, memory, and decision-making.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents performed significantly below human experts, revealing the difficulty of perception and planning in underwater scenarios.

Conclusion: OceanGym sets a benchmark for developing robust embodied AI for underwater operations, with potential real-world applications for autonomous ocean vehicles.

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

TL;DR: This paper investigates over-competition in multi-agent systems using a novel framework called HATE, revealing harmful effects on collaboration and task performance under competitive pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of competition on the behavior and performance of LLM-based multi-agent systems, specifically in debate scenarios.

Method: The authors propose and utilize a framework called HATE, simulating debates in a zero-sum competition setup, conducting experiments across different LLMs and tasks.

Result: Findings show that intense competition leads to over-competition, disrupting collaboration and task performance. Adding task-focused feedback partially resolves this issue.

Conclusion: Competitive pressures can have adverse effects on multi-agent systems, but objective feedback can mitigate these harms, improving understanding of AI social dynamics.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

Result: Encoder-based classifiers consistently outperformed generative LLMs in discharge diagnosis prediction. Retrieval augmentation for generative LLMs showed notable performance improvements.

Conclusion: Generative LLMs require augmentation strategies to reach competitive performance in clinical tasks, as encoder-based classifiers remain more effective in diagnosis prediction.

Abstract: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are

extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative
models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation
strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they
provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

Result: Open-weight LLMs outperform proprietary closed LLMs in generating explanations; encoder-decoder models rival decoder-only models.

Conclusion: Open-source language models prove effective for semantic explanation tasks, offering an alternative to closed proprietary systems.

Abstract: We apply definition generators based on open-weights large language models to
the task of creating explanations of novel senses, taking target word usages as

performing higher than the best submissions of the aforementioned shared task,
which employed closed proprietary LLMs. In addition, we find that

Motivation: To address the increasing challenge in distinguishing human-written content from LLM-generated text as these models advance in quality and complexity.

Method: VietBinoculars adapts the Binoculars method with optimized global thresholds and uses newly constructed Vietnamese AI-generated datasets for performance evaluation and benchmarking.

Result: VietBinoculars consistently exceeded 99% in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC across diverse datasets, outperforming both the original Binoculars and other leading detection tools, particularly when faced with modified prompting strategies.

Conclusion: VietBinoculars demonstrates superior performance in identifying Vietnamese LLM-generated text, making it an advanced tool in this growing field and proving its efficacy over traditional and state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT

Motivation: The research aims to address the demand for highly efficient route planning in modern logistics management by exploring solutions to the Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP).

Method: The study implemented two solutions, ACO and Google OR-Tools, utilizing Python and a custom dataset. The algorithms were evaluated on criteria such as routing efficiency, computation time, and scalability.

Result: ACO demonstrated flexibility in routing parameters, whereas OR-Tools showed faster computation, higher consistency, and lower input requirements.

Conclusion: The findings help inform the choice of routing strategies, suggesting ACO for adjustable scenarios and OR-Tools for quick, consistent, and scalable applications in real-time logistics systems.

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TyleR, a model using pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enhance inductive link prediction on knowledge graphs, particularly in cases with limited or absent type annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of inductive link prediction in knowledge graphs, where new entities frequently appear, and there is limited or incomplete type information which makes prediction difficult.

Method: TyleR is introduced as a type-less but type-aware model leveraging PLMs to enrich node representations with implicit type signals. This strengthens subgraph-based inductive link prediction even without explicit type information.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks reveal that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in scenarios with sparse type annotations and graph connectivity.

Conclusion: TyleR demonstrates the viability of replacing explicit type annotations with implicit semantic enrichment via PLMs, providing a robust approach for inductive link prediction. The code is shared for reproducibility.

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

*Yang Tang,Ruijie Liu,Yifan Wang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA) is proposed as an efficient fine-tuning pipeline for large language models, improving performance and greatly reducing resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla fine-tuning for LLMs demands intricate data handling and repeated experiments to achieve optimal generalization, creating inefficiencies.

Method: The DBA method uses zero-learning-rate training on general data to extract a global gradient, followed by gradient boosting and dynamic step correction during domain training, combined with annealing learning.

Result: DBA improves joint performance by 5.8% compared to vanilla fine-tuning and cuts GPU usage by 91.0%.

Conclusion: The DBA approach simplifies fine-tuning by eliminating general data reliance, improving performance, and greatly reducing computational resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces speech language models with semantic initialization and planning losses to improve robustness, consistency, and content planning in speech generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving robust and consistent generation in speech language models, focusing on factors like speaker, sentiment, and acoustic stability.

Method: Incorporates self-supervised initialization, alignment losses, thinning objectives, and auxiliary objectives. Three models were trained: two speech-only models (0.7B and 1.0B parameters) and one interleaved text-speech model (1.0B parameters).

Result: Speech-only models outperform other models in consistency across gender, sentiment, and acoustic factors. The interleaved model improves semantic alignment but at a cost of reduced consistency.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates achieving a balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding by model design and training techniques, without modifying tokenizers or runtime architecture. The approach is validated through acoustic, syntactic, and semantic studies.

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Method: Generate multiple summaries and task-specific Q&A pairs using LLMs in a zero-shot manner. Evaluate summary quality via task-related questions, select the best answers, and fine-tune the best LLM on the selected summaries.

Result: The proposed framework achieves competitive performance in zero-shot settings across multiple datasets and rivals supervised State-of-the-Art methods.

Conclusion: Utility-based LLM evaluation enhances task-oriented dialogue summarization and provides a cost-effective alternative to fully-supervised methods.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

### [189] [Feedback Forensics: A Toolkit to Measure AI Personality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26305)
*Arduin Findeis,Timo Kaufmann,Eyke Hüllermeier,Robert Mullins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Feedback Forensics," a toolkit to analyze AI personality changes influenced by feedback. The toolkit uses AI annotators and is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing a gap in tools that explicitly evaluate and track AI model personality changes influenced by human or AI feedback, especially given issues like sycophantic behavior and leaderboard overfitting.

Method: The authors developed Feedback Forensics, an open-source toolkit that analyzes AI personality traits through a Python API and browser app. It leverages AI annotators to study traits in feedback datasets and model behaviors.

Result: The toolkit was validated through two demonstrations: analyzing traits in popular feedback datasets and evaluating how well models exhibit these traits.

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics offers a transparent and useful tool for understanding personality traits in AI models and datasets, providing insights for researchers and developers in the field.

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

### [190] [One-Token Rollout: Guiding Supervised Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26313)
*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces One-Token Rollout (OTR), a novel algorithm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), which bridges the gap between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). It uses token-level on-policy learning to enhance generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles with generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL), likely due to the fixed dataset nature of SFT versus RL's dynamic on-policy data. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose one-token rollout (OTR), an algorithm that uses policy gradient to guide SFT. OTR treats each token generation as a single-step RL trajectory, using Monte Carlo rollouts to sample candidate tokens and leveraging supervised data to generate reward signals for these samples.

Result: OTR outperforms standard SFT across benchmarks in areas like mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, demonstrating a strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: The on-policy nature of data is crucial for enhanced generalization. OTR offers a practical and effective approach for fine-tuning LLMs, suggesting a significant improvement over conventional SFT methods.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

### [191] [Latent Thinking Optimization: Your Latent Reasoning Language Model Secretly Encodes Reward Signals in its Latent Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26314)
*Hanwen Du,Yuxin Dong,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces an optimized latent thinking process for large language models (LLMs) to enhance their reasoning abilities using latent space supervision and a probabilistic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and interpretability issues in latent reasoning processes for LLMs, such as Huggin-3.5B, and improve their reliability in generating correct answers.

Method: The authors analyze latent thinking patterns and use a latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic algorithm that adjusts latent processes by leveraging supervision signals.

Result: The Latent Reward Model reliably detects incorrect reasoning in latent representations, and LTO improves the correctness and reliability of the latent processes across diverse reasoning tasks and domains.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the potential of using supervised optimization in latent spaces, offering a general and efficient methodology to refine LLMs' reasoning without relying on costly verbal thinking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2 enables efficient parallel text generation by adapting pretrained autoregressive models with a block diffusion mechanism, reducing training data significantly while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of sequential decoding in autoregressive language models and improve their inference speed while preserving performance.

Method: A block diffusion language model (dLLM) with a novel training recipe combining a block diffusion mechanism and attention mask, coupled with a hierarchical caching mechanism for accelerated decoding.

Result: Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard autoregressive decoding and maintains or surpasses the original model's accuracy across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Efficient and accurate parallel text generation is achievable with Fast-dLLM v2, representing significant progress for practical deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

*Jinyeop Song,Song Wang,Julian Shun,Yada Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-R1 proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach to integrate knowledge-graph retrieval with language generation, optimizing performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces in knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation systems while addressing inefficiencies and inflexibility caused by multi-module workflows.

Method: KG-R1 employs reinforcement learning with a single agent interacting dynamically with knowledge graphs to retrieve, reason, and generate information in an optimized end-to-end manner.

Result: Controlled experiments show KG-R1 enhances answer accuracy with fewer tokens, achieves transferability across KGs, and utilizes smaller models compared to multi-module methods.

Conclusion: KG-R1 offers an efficient, accurate, and transferable framework for knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation, making it apt for real-world usage.

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

### [194] [An Annotation Scheme for Factuality and its Application to Parliamentary Proceedings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26406)
*Gili Goldin,Shira Wigderson,Ella Rabinovich,Shuly Wintner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-faceted annotation scheme for factuality, specifically applied to Hebrew parliamentary discourse, and experiments with automatic prediction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and measuring factuality in language is essential for tasks like fact-checking, but it involves complex linguistic considerations necessitating a comprehensive approach.

Method: The authors developed a multi-faceted factuality annotation scheme, applied it manually to 5,000 Hebrew sentences in parliamentary discourse, evaluated inter-annotator agreement, and tested automatic prediction methods.

Result: The annotation framework was successfully applied, inter-annotator agreement was analyzed, and initial experiments showed potential for extending annotations to larger datasets via automation.

Conclusion: The proposed factuality annotation scheme is a promising approach that can be adapted to other languages, facilitating better automatic factuality assessments in texts.

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

*Yanbin Fu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Robert W. Lissitz,Nan Zhang,Ming Li,Qingshu Xu,Sydney Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated alignment of test items to content standards in large-scale standardized tests, outperforming traditional embedding-based supervised learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test item alignment to content standards is crucial for validity and accuracy in test development; however, traditional alignment methods relying on human experts are subjective and inefficient.

Method: Fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) were used for automated alignment at both domain and skill levels (10 skills mapped to 4 domains). Model performance was evaluated on multiple datasets, considering input data type/size effects. Embedding-based machine learning models were trained for comparison.

Result: Fine-tuned SLMs outperformed embedding-based supervised models, particularly for skill-level alignment. Increased item text data significantly improved model performance beyond sample size alone. Analysis revealed semantically similar skills as a key source of misclassification.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned SLMs offer an effective, automated alternative for aligning test items to content standards, reducing reliance on subjective human judgment. Misclassifications arose mainly from semantic overlaps among closely related skills.

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

*Sangwon Ryu,Heejin Do,Yunsu Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACO, a training-free framework for generating multi-attribute controllable summaries using Adaptive Planning and Monte Carlo Tree Search, achieving superior performance across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of interdependence among attributes and inflexible per-attribute fine-tuning in controllable summarization.

Method: The paper proposes PACO, a framework that employs customized Monte Carlo Tree Search for sequential planning of attribute control, refining summaries progressively to meet multiple constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show PACO outperforms both fine-tuned and LLM-based self-planning models in controllability, achieving strong results even with smaller-scale models.

Conclusion: PACO represents a significant advance in controllable summarization by enabling robust and adaptive multi-attribute control, offering flexibility and superior performance.

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CreAgentive, a creative writing engine overcoming large language model (LLM) limitations in genre diversity, narrative coherence, and structural enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in contemporary LLMs focused on creating diverse, coherent, and structurally advanced long-form narratives like stories and dramas.

Method: The authors designed CreAgentive around a knowledge graph-based representation called "Story Prototype," implemented through a three-stage workflow: (1) constructing a narrative skeleton, (2) agent-driven dialogues for detailed planning, and (3) stylistic realization of text using narrative structures like foreshadowing.

Result: CreAgentive was tested in extensive experiments, producing thousands of high-quality chapters with low costs. Its performance surpassed strong baseline models on narrative quality and length while showing robustness across genres.

Conclusion: CreAgentive demonstrates potential in automated long-form narrative generation, approaching human-authored quality and offering innovative solutions for creative AI technologies.

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: dLLMs offer faster token generation but face bottlenecks in parallel decoding. The dParallel method optimizes training to improve decoding speed and performance, achieving significant speedups without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of dLLMs in parallel token prediction and decoding steps, aiming to reduce inference latency while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The method employs certainty-forcing distillation, a training strategy that forces high certainty on masked tokens faster and in parallel, thereby improving sampling efficiency.

Result: dParallel demonstrated up to an 8.5x speedup on GSM8K with no performance degradation and a 10.5x speedup on MBPP while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The dParallel method successfully enhances the efficiency of dLLMs by introducing certainty-forcing distillation, unlocking fast and accurate parallel decoding without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces VitaBench, a challenging LLM-based benchmark designed for evaluating agents in real-world versatile tasks, demonstrating the difficulty with low model success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks do not adequately measure or challenge LLM-based agents in handling complex real-life scenarios, diverse tools, and dynamic interactions.

Method: The authors developed VitaBench with 66 tools and flexible scenarios to simulate real-world tasks. The framework eliminates domain-specific policies, creating 100 cross-scenario tasks and 300 single-scenario tasks. An innovative rubric-based evaluator aids in assessing solutions.

Result: Advanced LLM models struggle with VitaBench tasks, averaging a 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks and under 50% on single-scenario tasks.

Conclusion: VitaBench highlights the shortcomings of current AI agents in real-world applications and acts as a resource for future improvement in this domain. Code and resources are made openly available.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

### [201] [BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26514)
*Yue Wang,Ruotian Ma,Xingyu Chen,Zhengliang Shi,Wanshun Chen,Huang Liu,Jiadi Yao,Qu Yang,Qingxuan Jiang,Fanghua Ye,Juntao Li,Min Zhang,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li,Linus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BatonVoice, a system utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for speech synthesis by separating instruction understanding and speech generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize LLMs' linguistic intelligence and instruction-following abilities when applied to controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS).

Method: The BatonVoice framework uses an LLM as a "conductor" to process user instructions into textual vocal features and a specialized TTS model, BatonTTS, as an "orchestra" to generate speech from these features.

Result: BatonVoice achieves strong controllable and emotional speech synthesis while outperforming existing baselines. It exhibits zero-shot cross-lingual generalization to unseen languages.

Conclusion: Objectifying speech into textual vocal features effectively leverages the linguistic intelligence of LLMs for advanced and versatile speech synthesis applications.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively

*Yaoxiang Wang,Qingguo Hu,Yucheng Ding,Ruizhe Wang,Yeyun Gong,Jian Jiao,Yelong Shen,Peng Cheng,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Matryoshka MoE (M-MoE), a training framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, to enhance flexibility at inference time through a coarse-to-fine structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face performance degradation when the number of activated experts is changed during inference. The paper seeks to address this limitation to enable elastic inference without compromising performance.

Method: M-MoE employs a systematic approach by varying the number of activated experts during training to instill a meaningful ranking into the model. Coarse-grained capabilities are provided by top-ranked experts, while additional experts fine-tune the details. Layer-wise randomization is identified as the optimal strategy.

Result: A single M-MoE model achieves elasticity close to that of multiple specialist models but at lower training costs. It adapts to varying computational budgets and maintains competitive performance across different expert counts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework makes large-scale MoE models more practical and adaptable by allowing elastic inference and optimizing performance across computational budgets, promoting more flexible deployments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

*Lina Conti,Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Guillaume Wisniewski,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first method for generating contrastive explanations in speech-to-text (S2T) models, focusing on how input features influence output choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive explanations are more informative and interpretable but are challenging to obtain for speech-to-text generative models.

Method: The authors adapted feature attribution techniques to analyze how portions of an input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.

Result: They demonstrated their method in a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, showing it effectively identifies audio features that drive output selections.

Conclusion: This method expands the applicability of contrastive explanations to S2T models, laying groundwork for improved understanding of such systems.

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

### [204] [Towards Reliable Benchmarking: A Contamination Free, Controllable Evaluation Framework for Multi-step LLM Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26553)
*Seiji Maekawa,Jackson Hassell,Pouya Pezeshkpour,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces FuncBenchGen, a framework for assessing tool-augmented language models (TaLMs) with controlled synthetic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for TaLMs lack control over task parameters, making evaluations inconsistent and prone to data contamination.

Method: The authors propose generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks by modeling tool interactions as traversals in a hidden function-dependency graph, offering precise difficulty tuning.

Result: Performance evaluation with seven LLMs demonstrated that reasoning-optimized models outperformed general ones, highlighting brittle state tracking issues and showing substantial improvements with a simple mitigation strategy.

Conclusion: Restating prior variable values at each tool-use step enhances TaLM task success rates significantly, addressing state-tracking weaknesses and offering valuable implications for model design.

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

### [205] [Generating Difficult-to-Translate Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26592)
*Vilém Zouhar,Wenda Xu,Parker Riley,Juraj Juraska,Mara Finkelstein,Markus Freitag,Dan Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Traditional machine translation benchmarks struggle to identify challenging examples for advanced translation models due to their ease of use. This paper introduces MT-breaker, an iterative approach leveraging large language models to generate difficult test cases that remain diverse and natural.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing benchmarks that fail to differentiate the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation models. Current strategies lack diversity and naturalness in the examples or fail to pinpoint challenging cases.

Method: The method, MT-breaker, uses a large language model to iteratively refine source texts, increasing their translation difficulty by querying target MT models to guide generation. This ensures diversity and preserves the natural quality of texts.

Result: MT-breaker produces examples that are significantly harder for target MT models than traditional test cases. The difficulty of these examples also transfers across various models and languages, enhancing their usefulness.

Conclusion: MT-breaker offers a novel and effective way to create robust and challenging benchmarks that reveal the shortcomings of machine translation models, expanding their applicability in diverse settings.

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

### [206] [Deconstructing Self-Bias in LLM-generated Translation Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26600)
*Wenda Xu,Sweta Agrawal,Vilém Zouhar,Markus Freitag,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines biases in automated benchmarks created by large language models (LLMs) for translation tasks, finding that these benchmarks favor the models that generate them, especially in translations into English.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the biases inherent in automated benchmarks created by LLMs, which can systematically favor the model that created them, raising concerns about reliability and fairness in translation evaluations.

Method: The study analyzes benchmark creation and evaluation processes in LLMs and investigates the impact of source text diversity and generation capabilities on self bias in translation tasks.

Result: Three key findings are highlighted: (1) Self bias originates from both generated test data and evaluation methods. (2) Bias is more pronounced in translations into English due to better generation capabilities in English. (3) Low diversity in source text contributes to the bias.

Conclusion: Improving the diversity of generated source texts can reduce self bias observed in automated benchmarks, enhancing their fairness and reliability for translation tasks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

*Chenxi Whitehouse,Sebastian Ruder,Tony Lin,Oksana Kurylo,Haruka Takagi,Janice Lam,Nicolò Busetto,Denise Diaz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MENLO, a framework for evaluating native-like quality in multilingual LLM responses, creates a large annotated dataset, and shows improvements in evaluation through fine-tuning and training approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of ensuring native-like response quality of LLMs across multiple languages and evaluate their performance accurately.

Method: Introduce MENLO for evaluation using audience-design and collect a dataset with human-annotated quality judgments. Fine-tune LLMs using reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning to enhance evaluation accuracy.

Result: Human annotators outperform zero-shot LLMs in preference evaluation. RL-trained judges reduce the gap but still fall short. The RL-trained models improve LLM multilingual capabilities but discrepancies with human judgment persist.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning and enhanced evaluation methods improve LLM multilingual performance, but significant gaps remain compared to human judgment. The dataset and framework provide a foundation for future research in multilingual evaluation.

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepScientist is an AI system designed for autonomous, goal-oriented scientific discovery, outperforming human-designed methods in several high-level AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of previous AI scientist systems, which struggled to focus on solving pressing scientific challenges.

Method: Implements a hierarchical evaluation process ('hypothesize, verify, and analyze') framed as a Bayesian Optimization problem, utilizing a cumulative Findings Memory to balance exploration and exploitation of hypotheses.

Result: Generated 5,000 unique ideas, validated 1,100 experimentally, and outperformed human state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on three AI tasks.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that an AI system can achieve discoveries exceeding human performance across specific scientific tasks, opening doors for further research through accessible experimental logs and code.

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

*Wenda Xu,Vilém Zouhar,Parker Riley,Mara Finkelstein,Markus Freitag,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of identifying difficult test data topics for NLP models, framing the task as a multi-armed bandit problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying challenging test examples for NLP models is critical, but computational constraints make it hard to evaluate large numbers of topics systematically.

Method: The paper treats the problem as a multi-armed bandit setup where topics are "arms," and the difficulty of test examples is estimated by drawing a single instance and evaluating it. Effective bandit strategies are proposed to optimize this search.

Result: Bandit strategies significantly outperform baseline approaches like brute-force exploration in efficiently identifying challenging topics.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for efficiently pinpointing difficult topics, demonstrated in a machine translation example, and offers scalable testing for NLP models.

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

### [210] [Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26634)
*Nicholas Lee,Cheol Jun Cho,Alan W Black,Gopala K. Anumanchipalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work explores syllable-level tokenization for spoken language models, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency in processing long token streams with self-attention in spoken language models by introducing syllable-level tokenization.

Method: The paper systematically evaluates syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling across SLU benchmarks and various scales of training data.

Result: Syllabic tokens achieve similar or better performance compared to high-frame-rate tokens and significantly reduce training time (by more than 2x) and inference costs (5x reduction in FLOPs).

Conclusion: Syllable-level tokenization is an efficient and promising approach to building scalable and interpretable long-context spoken language models.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

*Finlay Fehlauer,Kyle Mahowald,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the convergence of language models (LMs) across different random seeds, identifying a four-phase convergence pattern and varying stability across linguistic categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models trained under different conditions converge in terms of their output probability distributions and to identify factors affecting this stability.

Method: Analyzing the expected per-token KL divergence across training seeds, model sizes, and checkpoints, as well as focusing on specific token frequencies and part-of-speech tags.

Result: The study identifies four distinct convergence phases and finds that larger models reconverge faster, while smaller models don’t achieve stable distributions. Frequent tokens and function words exhibit better convergence than infrequent tokens and content words.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the factors affecting training stability of language models, emphasizing the role of model size and linguistic properties in achieving consistent learned distributions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA datasets have significant quality issues like inaccurate annotations, unclear questions, and outdated data, limiting meaningful evaluations of KGQA systems.

Method: The authors designed KGQAGen, combining structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to create high-quality QA datasets.

Result: The KGQAGen framework created the KGQAGen-10k benchmark based on Wikidata, which revealed weaknesses in current state-of-the-art KGQA systems.

Conclusion: Rigorous benchmark construction is essential to advancing KGQA systems, and KGQAGen represents a scalable and effective solution for evaluating KGQA models.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

### [213] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LUMA, a novel diffusion model for text-to-motion generation that uses dual-path anchoring to address semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle two common issues in text-to-motion generation using diffusion models: semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts, which stem from gradient attenuation in deep layers impairing high-level feature learning.

Method: LUMA employs dual-path anchoring: a temporal path using a lightweight MoCLIP model with contrastive learning for semantic supervision, and a frequency domain path using low-frequency DCT components. These anchors are fused adaptively during denoising for semantic refinement.

Result: LUMA demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on HumanML3D (FID: 0.035) and KIT-ML (FID: 0.123) datasets, while accelerating convergence by 1.4x compared to the baseline model.

Conclusion: LUMA is an efficient, scalable, and high-fidelity text-to-motion generation model that overcomes key performance bottlenecks in current approaches.

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [214] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VisualOverload, a new visual question answering (VQA) benchmark aimed at testing basic vision tasks in highly detailed and populated scenes. The benchmark reveals that current state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle significantly with these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that current VQA datasets emphasize global image understanding while neglecting the challenges of detailed and densely populated scenes. The authors aim to test whether state-of-the-art VLMs can handle such scenarios effectively.

Method: They developed the VisualOverload benchmark, featuring 2,720 question-answer pairs on public-domain paintings. These paintings include detailed scenes with multiple figures and actions. The dataset tests six different task categories to assess VLM capabilities.

Result: The best-performing model out of 37 tested achieved only 19.6% accuracy on the most difficult test subset and 69.5% accuracy overall. The authors also performed an error analysis, showing issues in counting, OCR, and logical reasoning in complex tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that current VLMs are inadequate for handling detailed and densely populated visual scenes. The VisualOverload benchmark highlights these limitations and provides an essential resource for improving the capabilities of such models.

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [215] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to edit heart rate (HR) signals in facial videos while maintaining visual quality, addressing privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The presence of vital signals in facial videos may reveal sensitive personal information, creating privacy concerns that need addressing.

Method: The framework involves encoding videos via a pretrained 3D VAE, embedding target HR prompts using a text encoder, and leveraging spatio-temporal layers with Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) for precise physiological signal editing.

Result: It achieves strong visual quality with metrics such as PSNR 38.96 dB and SSIM 0.98, while maintaining low errors in HR modulation: 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively anonymizes or modifies physiological signals in videos, showing potential for applications like privacy protection and synthesis of realistic videos with customized vital signs.

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show

### [216] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench evaluates spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) via perspective-taking tasks, revealing weaknesses like egocentric bias and poor rotational understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address gaps in evaluating spatial reasoning capabilities in VLMs and highlight shortcomings in perspective-taking, which is vital for understanding physical space.

Method: SpinBench introduces diagnostic categories targeting translation, rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, with tasks escalating from single-object to multi-object complexity. The benchmark assesses 37 VLMs and compares their performance to humans.

Result: The evaluated VLMs exhibit systematic weaknesses such as egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding, and inconsistencies. Human subjects achieved high accuracy (91.2%), and task difficulty strongly correlates with VLM performance.

Conclusion: SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning limitations in VLMs, emphasizing the need for improvement in physical space reasoning. Results can guide future developments in cognitive capabilities of VLMs.

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-STT, a framework for high-resolution land subsidence forecasting, which fuses dynamic and static data using spatio-temporal attention, significantly outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance forecasting of complex and non-linear land subsidence dynamics by overcoming challenges like modeling long-range dependencies and the limitations of uni-modal data approaches.

Method: Developed the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT), which integrates dynamic displacement data with static physical priors through a spatio-temporal attention mechanism for unified multi-modal data processing.

Result: MM-STT achieves state-of-the-art results on EGMS dataset, significantly reducing long-range forecast RMSE compared to established methods like STGCN and STAEformer.

Conclusion: For complex forecasting problems, deep multi-modal fusion capabilities within architectures are crucial for transformative performance improvements.

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [218] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DepthLM, a novel approach that enables Vision Language Models (VLMs) to achieve expert-level accuracy in 3D understanding, specifically metric depth estimation, without requiring architecture or loss modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art Vision Language Models struggle with 3D understanding tasks using 2D input, whereas pure vision models excel in tasks like metric depth estimation but require specialized architectures and losses.

Method: The method utilizes text-based supervised fine-tuning with sparse labels, visual prompting, and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation to enable VLMs to perform strong 3D understanding without complex heads or losses.

Result: DepthLM surpasses the performance of existing advanced VLMs in depth estimation accuracy, making it competitive with pure vision models and reducing issues like over-smoothing at object boundaries.

Conclusion: DepthLM demonstrates that a single VLM can effectively cover multiple 3D tasks without explicit enforcement or architectural complexity, marking a significant advancement toward efficient 3D task handling in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian Transformer model for more accurate Pan-Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) mapping and uncertainty quantification, using multi-source satellite data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution SIC mapping with reliable uncertainty is crucial for operational decision-making but is hindered by challenges such as ice signature subtleties, model limitations, and data variety.

Method: A novel Transformer model combines global and local modules for enhanced feature extraction, incorporates Bayesian methods to improve uncertainty quantification, and fuses data from Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 at decision-level.

Result: Experimental results on Pan-Arctic datasets (September 2021) show superior SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian Transformer approach effectively addresses the challenges of SIC mapping and quantifies uncertainties, improving operational applications like sea ice charting.

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

*Suhala Rabab Saba,Sakib Khan,Minhaj Uddin Ahmad,Jiahe Cao,Mizanur Rahman,Li Zhao,Nathan Huynh,Eren Erman Ozguven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study integrates roadside camera and LiDAR sensors with a Kalman Filter-based fusion method for improving vehicle trajectory tracking in high-risk sites such as work zones, proving scalable and cost-effective solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many high-risk roadway areas, such as work zones, suffer from insufficient safety systems due to sensor limitations, perspective distortion, and high costs. This paper aims to address these challenges with a robust sensor fusion framework.

Method: The paper developed a cosimulation environment combining data from roadside cameras and LiDAR sensors and employed a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to improve vehicle localization and trajectory accuracy.

Result: Simulations showed a 70% reduction in longitudinal error and consistent lateral accuracy (1-3 meters). Field validation confirmed the modeled trajectories closely matched real-world vehicle paths, even with intermittent sensor data.

Conclusion: The KF-based fusion approach effectively compensates for individual sensor limitations, demonstrating practical viability for scaling multi-sensor infrastructure and enhancing safety in complex roadway conditions.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detecting AI-generated images using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) faces challenges due to deficiencies in visual perception and the incompatibility of pretraining and fine-tuning data formats. Authors propose a paradigm focused on strengthening artifact-aware visual perception followed by reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models have limitations in reliably detecting AI-generated images and explaining their decisions due to focus on high-level semantic recognition rather than detecting subtle forgery traces.

Method: Proposed a new detection paradigm - "seeing before reasoning" - using a model named Forensic-Chat, which enhances artifact-aware visual perception and preserves conversational reasoning. Developed ExplainFake-Bench for explainability evaluation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved generalization and explainability of Forensic-Chat in detecting fake images compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Grounding the reasoning process in enhanced visual artifact perception is key to effectively leveraging MLLMs for fake image detection and maintaining their dialogic capabilities.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to detect deepfakes during video meetings by analyzing gaze patterns and leveraging point-of-gaze tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the emerging threat of real-time phishing attacks conducted using deepfakes during video meetings and highlights the need for robust detection methods.

Method: The authors use gaze tracking to estimate the point of gaze in video calls. They build their model with explainable features informed by research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations and test it on a custom-created dataset.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated its ability with an accuracy of 82%, making it effective in distinguishing deepfakes based on gaze patterns.

Conclusion: The study introduces an innovative biometric-based approach to deepfake detection, leveraging gaze information for the first time and demonstrating its feasibility for real-time application.

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel vision-based 6-DoF pose estimation algorithm for robotic arms in Mars missions, utilizing low-fidelity 3D models and edge-domain metrics for robust performance in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem stems from a Mars Sample Return campaign where robotic arms need to perform precise object localization for tasks under significant hardware constraints.

Method: The algorithm combines a custom renderer and an edge-domain-oriented template matching metric to enable accurate pose estimation using low-fidelity models.

Result: Extensive testing on synthetic datasets, physical testbeds on Earth, and Mars imagery demonstrates superior robustness and accuracy compared to existing methods under compute and memory limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed method facilitates cheap, reliable, and accurate localization for constrained hardware systems, unlocking new possibilities for planetary exploration robotics.

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents LLM-RG, a pipeline combining vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to improve the grounding of natural-language references in outdoor driving scenes, achieving better performance on the Talk2Car benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolving natural-language references in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to scene complexity, visually similar objects, and dynamic elements.

Method: LLM-RG integrates vision-language models for visual attribute extraction with large language models for symbolic reasoning. It processes images and referring expressions by detecting regions, generating descriptors, and employing chain-of-thought reasoning to identify targets.

Result: LLM-RG achieves significant improvements in referential grounding performance over baseline LLM and VLM approaches, particularly when incorporating 3D spatial cues.

Conclusion: The complementary strengths of LLMs and VLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, enable robust outdoor referential grounding, as demonstrated on the Talk2Car benchmark.

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [225] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISOR++, a method for steering Vision Language Models (VLMs) using optimized visual inputs rather than internal modifications, proving efficacy for behavioral control in open and closed-access models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to control VLMs' behavior in safety-critical applications and limitations of existing methods, such as reliance on runtime access or vulnerability to user instructions.

Method: VISOR++ uses optimized visual inputs to influence the model's behavior without requiring runtime model access. It eliminates the need for intrusive steering vectors by utilizing pre-generated input images.

Result: VISOR++ demonstrates performance parity with steering vectors across alignment tasks like refusal, sycophancy, and survival instinct. It is effective on unseen models and preserves high performance on unrelated evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: VISOR++ provides a deployment-agnostic solution for behavioral control in VLMs, with broad applicability across both open and closed-access models.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Vision-Zero, a framework allowing self-improvement of vision-language models (VLMs) through strategic visual games without requiring labor-intensive datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for enhancing vision-language models rely on costly, labor-intensive datasets, restricting their scalability and practicality.

Method: Vision-Zero trains VLMs via competitive games ('Who Is the Spy') using arbitrary image pairs, combined with Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization (Iterative-SPO) for sustained self-improvement.

Result: Vision-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in reasoning and visual understanding tasks without using human-annotated data. It demonstrates generalization across multiple image datasets.

Conclusion: Vision-Zero offers a scalable, domain-agnostic approach for training VLMs with label-free data, reducing the need for manual annotation while achieving superior results.

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid model combining U-Net and mathematical/clustering methods to improve fundus lesion segmentation for diagnosing choroidal nevi, achieving superior metrics compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in accurately diagnosing choroidal nevi in fundus images, particularly due to low-quality datasets and the limitations of conventional and AI-based methods.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid segmentation model that combines mathematical/clustering methods with U-Net architecture to enhance accuracy, reduce training data dependency, and increase generalizability for fundus lesion segmentation.

Result: The hybrid model achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and IoU of 80.01% on high-resolution 1024*1024 fundus images, significantly outperforming the Attention U-Net model.

Conclusion: The proposed model shows promise as part of an automated decision support system for accurate choroidal nevus diagnosis, with implications for improving speed and reliability in clinical settings.

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Motivation: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show impressive capabilities but struggle in fine-grained tasks like fish species recognition, critical for understanding marine ecosystems.

Method: FishNet++ is introduced as a benchmark, providing large-scale multimodal annotations (text descriptions, key-point annotations, bounding boxes) to enable specialized vision-language model development.

Result: State-of-the-art open-source MLLMs achieved less than 10% accuracy in recognizing fish species, revealing significant limitations.

Conclusion: The creation of FishNet++ paves the way for better evaluation and design of domain-specific MLLMs, addressing challenges in aquatic science and ecosystem monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development
and evaluation of specialized vision-language models capable of advancing
aquatic science.

Method: The authors proposed a cross-attention-based feature aggregation method, where node query projections interact with neighbor key projections, and implemented this approach in the AttentionViG model for non-local message passing.

Result: AttentionViG demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1K for image recognition, efficient transferability for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, while maintaining comparable computational cost to existing ViG architectures.

Conclusion: AttentionViG proves to be a high-performing and efficient solution for vision tasks, displaying both accuracy and practicality across various datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

### [230] [MetaChest: Generalized few-shot learning of patologies from chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25590)
*Berenice Montalvo-Lezama,Gibran Fuentes-Pineda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of few-shot learning in medical imaging via the MetaChest dataset, presenting experimental findings on multi-label classification and model performance enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of limited annotated data in medical imaging, particularly focusing on scenarios requiring generalized few-shot learning.

Method: The MetaChest dataset is introduced, comprising 479,215 chest X-ray images, alongside methods for meta-set partitioning and multi-label episode generation. Experiments compare transfer learning and an extension of ProtoNet.

Result: Findings show that transfer learning surpasses the ProtoNet extension in few-shot tasks. Performance improves with more classes per episode, examples per class, and higher-resolution images albeit with trade-offs in computational cost.

Conclusion: The paper highlights practical strategies for enhancing generalized few-shot learning performance in medical imaging, emphasizing efficient resource use and leveraging high-resolution data.

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

*Bangwei Guo,Yunhe Gao,Meng Ye,Difei Gu,Yang Zhou,Leon Axel,Dimitris Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces K-Prism, a unified model for medical image segmentation that integrates three paradigms: semantic priors, in-context knowledge, and interactive feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmentation in medical image segmentation, where existing models operate on isolated tasks and do not reflect the integrated approaches used in clinical practice.

Method: The proposed K-Prism framework encodes knowledge sources using a dual-prompt representation (1-D sparse prompts and 2-D dense prompts) and processes them through a Mixture-of-Experts decoder for flexible and unified segmentation.

Result: K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation across 18 public datasets covering various image modalities.

Conclusion: K-Prism represents a significant step toward unifying diverse segmentation tasks, reflecting clinical practice with higher flexibility and performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

### [232] [GaussianLens: Localized High-Resolution Reconstruction via On-Demand Gaussian Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25603)
*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaussianLens, a method focusing on localized high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction by densifying specific regions of interest using sparse high-resolution observations, addressing performance and scalability issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations in current 3D scene reconstruction methods that either require extensive computational resources for uniform high-resolution outputs or are slow and require dense observations. The aim is to align with human perception's focus on critical regions while avoiding processing redundancies.

Method: The proposed GaussianLens method uses a feed-forward densification framework that integrates multi-modal information from initial 3DGS reconstructions and multi-view images. It introduces a pixel-guided densification mechanism to accurately capture details in high-resolution regions.

Result: GaussianLens outperforms competing methods in reconstructing localized fine details and demonstrates strong scalability to handle input images with resolutions up to 1024×1024.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between the computational cost of high-resolution reconstructions and the need for localized detail reconstruction, making it an efficient choice for user-specified regions of interest.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large-scale multimodal benchmark for ophthalmology, addressing workforce shortages and data gaps for diagnosing vision-threatening conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the global health burden of vision-threatening eye diseases and the lack of datasets suitable for evaluating medical AI models in ophthalmology.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark dataset with 32,633 multimodal instances, incorporating annotations for anatomical structures, diseases, imaging modalities, and demographic predictions. Additionally, they systematically evaluated 24 state-of-the-art multimodal large language models.

Result: Expanded dataset tasks and coverage with a 50% increase in data size. Best-performing models achieved ~58% accuracy in zero-shot disease screening, while struggling with disease staging tasks.

Conclusion: The dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard will be made publicly accessible to enhance AI-driven advancements in ophthalmology and alleviate the global impact of eye diseases.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

*Xingtao Ling,Chenlin Fu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an anchor-free approach for cross-view object geo-localization, offering improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on anchor-based paradigms, which are limited by predefined anchors and struggle with cross-view localization challenges.

Method: The proposed AFGeo model predicts directional offsets without anchors, incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding for spatial prior, and uses a Cross-view Object Association Module to handle appearance gaps.

Result: AFGeo achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved robustness and reduced computational overhead on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The anchor-free AFGeo model demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy, marking progress in lightweight and effective cross-view object geo-localization.

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

### [235] [Generalized Contrastive Learning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25638)
*Jungsoo Lee,Janghoon Cho,Hyojin Park,Munawar Hayat,Kyuwoong Hwang,Fatih Porikli,Sungha Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current cross-modal retrieval models, like CLIP, for keys composed of fused image-text modality by proposing Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), an advanced loss formulation that enhances multimodal retrieval performance without requiring additional dataset curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While cross-modal retrieval models perform well, they struggle with tasks that involve fused image-text data, necessitating a unified approach for multimodal retrieval to handle diverse modality combinations efficiently.

Method: The paper proposes Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), which enforces contrastive learning across all modalities in a mini-batch, leveraging existing image-caption paired datasets to establish a unified representation space.

Result: The proposed GCL method achieved consistent performance improvements when applied to existing multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP), as demonstrated using benchmarks like M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR.

Conclusion: The GCL approach effectively addresses the limitations of multimodal retrieval systems by improving performance without requiring burdensome dataset curation, offering a scalable and generalizable solution across diverse modality combinations.

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper explores using synthetic images from video games to train CNNs for detecting real-life truck axles. Results show synthetic data is effective, achieving up to 99% mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection for CNN training can be costly. Using synthetic images generated from video games offers a potential low-cost alternative.

Method: Created three databases using real and synthetic truck images, trained YOLO architectures, and evaluated performance with precision, recall, F1-score, mAP, and statistical significance tests.

Result: Synthetic image training contributed significantly to CNN performance. The best mAP achieved was 99%, indicating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Synthetic images from video games are a reliable, cost-effective resource for neural network training and real-world applications.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Geo-DLC, a new task for detailed object-level captioning in remote sensing, supported by a dataset, benchmarking suite, and a specialized model, DescribeEarth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance remote sensing image analysis by providing object-level details, addressing the lack of fine-grained semantic interpretation which restricts their usefulness.

Method: The authors developed the Geo-DLC task, constructed the DE-Dataset with annotated object descriptions, created DE-Benchmark for evaluation, and introduced the DescribeEarth model featuring advanced multimodal integration strategies.

Result: DescribeEarth outperformed existing multimodal large language models in descriptive richness, accuracy, and grammar, particularly in complex and diverse remote sensing scenarios.

Conclusion: Geo-DLC, DE-Dataset, DE-Benchmark, and the DescribeEarth model collectively advance remote sensing image captioning, enabling detailed analyses and aiding practical applications in various domains.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a YOLO-based deep learning model integrated with ConSinGAN data augmentation for automated defect detection in manufacturing, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate defect detection tasks in industrial manufacturing, reducing time and manual efforts, especially with limited training data.

Method: The authors train YOLO models (YOLOv3, v4, v7, v9) on metal sheet images, using ConSinGAN to augment the dataset and improve detection performance.

Result: The YOLOv9 model paired with ConSinGAN achieves the highest detection accuracy (91.3%) and shortest detection time (146 ms) compared to other models.

Conclusion: The YOLOv9 with ConSinGAN offers an effective automated defect detection system, which is further integrated into manufacturing hardware and SCADA systems for practical industrial applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework and dataset to improve AI-generated image detection and source attribution, addressing challenges in diverse generative models and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing detection methods being prone to overfitting and the lack of large-scale synthetic image datasets for effective source attribution.

Method: The paper proposes a framework called OmniDFA for authenticity assessment and few-shot source attribution, along with the creation of OmniFake, a synthetic image dataset with 1.17M images from 45 generative models.

Result: Experiments show that OmniDFA achieves state-of-the-art generalization in AIGI detection and excels in open-set attribution tasks.

Conclusion: OmniDFA and OmniFake provide significant advancements in combating deepfake abuse, offering robust, scalable solutions for detection and attribution with publicly available resources.

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIMCoT, an advanced multimodal Chain-of-Thought framework, addressing the limitations of existing methods to improve vision-language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal Chain-of-Thought methods rely on unreliable attention heuristics and lack active and goal-oriented strategies for selecting visual information.

Method: AIMCoT incorporates (1) Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation for better attention maps, (2) Active Visual Probing for targeted image region selection using information theory, and (3) Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger for timing the integration of visual context.

Result: AIMCoT achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across three challenging benchmarks in vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: AIMCoT demonstrates the advantages of actively seeking information and intelligent reasoning structuring, paving the way for enhanced human-like multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies why and how diffusion models memorize training data, identifying that early overestimation during the denoising process drives memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the question of why and how memorization occurs in diffusion models, which raises concerns regarding privacy and copyright.

Method: The authors analyze latent space dynamics during the diffusion and denoising processes, examining how memorization evolves and is driven by predictions and latent trajectories.

Result: Memorization stems from overestimation of training samples during early denoising, reducing diversity, accelerating convergence toward memorized images, and deviating from the theoretical denoising schedule.

Conclusion: Early overestimation is identified as the central mechanism causing memorization in diffusion models, enhancing understanding of memorization dynamics and its mitigation.

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProbMED, a multimodal Med-VLPM that uses probabilistic contrastive learning to unify embeddings from diverse medical modalities, achieving improved performance in retrieval and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VLPMs struggle to model the many-to-many mappings in diverse medical modalities, leading to suboptimal integration and performance.

Method: The authors employ probabilistic contrastive learning using InfoNCE loss with Hellinger distance, along with a synthetic sampling loss to capture embedding distributions across four medical modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments across 13 datasets show that ProbMED outperforms existing Med-VLPMs in cross-modality tasks, zero-shot/few-shot classification, and robustness in prognostication.

Conclusion: ProbMED successfully addresses cross-modal integration challenges by modeling probabilistic embeddings, improving performance in multimodal medical diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

### [243] [Importance Sampling for Multi-Negative Multimodal Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25717)
*Xintong Li,Chuhan Wang,Junda Wu,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MISP-DPO, a novel framework that enhances multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by using multiple semantically diverse negative images instead of simplistic pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language DPO approaches fail to effectively capture complex multimodal preferences due to oversimplified methods for generating negative samples, leading to optimization biases and model hallucinations.

Method: MISP-DPO integrates multiple semantically diverse negative samples through a semantic-aware selection process in CLIP space using sparse autoencoding and employs the Plackett-Luce model and importance sampling strategy to efficiently manage multi-negative comparisons.

Result: Experiments across five benchmarks show consistent improvements in multimodal alignment with the inclusion of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling, outperforming prior DPO methods.

Conclusion: MISP-DPO offers a more effective and efficient framework for multimodal preference-based learning by addressing the limitations in negative sample generation and optimizing alignment through comprehensive semantic supervision.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a training pipeline for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) that improves spatial-visual discrimination using innovative techniques like online geo-visual graphs and lightweight modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of VPR, which involves retrieving geotagged images despite variations in appearance, viewpoint, and environment. Existing methods fail to consider the dynamic relationship between spatial context and visual similarity during training.

Method: SAGE enhances VPR by combining advanced local feature aggregation, dynamic sample organization, and hard sample mining. It uses a Soft Probing module for patch descriptors and constructs geo-visual graphs during training, focusing learning on the most relevant neighborhoods using weighted clique expansions.

Result: With a frozen DINOv2 backbone, SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks, including 98.9% Recall@1 on SPED and 100% Recall@10 on SPED with compact global descriptors.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates SAGE's effectiveness in refining spatial-visual discrimination for VPR, outperforming existing techniques while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

*Zhenghao Zhang,Ziying Zhang,Junchao Liao,Xiangyu Meng,Qiang Hu,Siyu Zhu,Xiaoyun Zhang,Long Qin,Weizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaTo, a novel model for instruction-based face editing that achieves improved identity preservation and precise attribute control compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with maintaining identity and supporting precise attribute control during face editing, particularly when landmarks deviate significantly from the source.

Method: LaTo uses a landmark tokenizer for facial token quantization, a positional encoding method for geometry-appearance integration, and a landmark predictor leveraging vision-language models for accurate target estimation.

Result: LaTo improves identity preservation by 7.8% and semantic consistency by 4.6% compared to state-of-the-art methods, supported by experiments using the newly curated HFL-150K benchmark.

Conclusion: LaTo effectively addresses limitations in current face editing methods, providing fine-grained control and enhanced identity preservation while setting new benchmarks with HFL-150K dataset.

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Shigui Li,Wei Chen,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVODiff, a method that improves the efficiency and quality of diffusion models for image generation by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the slow inference and training-inference discrepancies in diffusion models, while providing a theoretical grounding in information-theoretic efficiency.

Method: Develop an entropy-aware variance optimization approach (EVODiff) to systematically reduce uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy. This is achieved by adopting data prediction parameterization and conditional variance optimization.

Result: EVODiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art gradient-based solvers, reducing reconstruction errors by 45.5% and achieving faster and higher-quality image generation across various datasets including CIFAR-10, ImageNet-256, and text-to-image tasks.

Conclusion: Optimizing conditional entropy during denoising enhances both the efficiency and quality of image generation in diffusion models, with EVODiff offering a superior alternative to existing solvers.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Object Segmentation remains challenging, especially under complex scenarios like object disappearances or small/inconspicuous object tracking. The MOSEv1 and LVOS datasets aim to enhance model robustness in handling these complexities.

Method: The CGFSeg method involves freezing the feature extractor during training to preserve extraction strength, fine-tuning other components for segmentation accuracy, and using a pixel-check strategy in inference for refined predictions.

Result: The approach achieves a high J&F score of 86.37% on the test set, ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025.

Conclusion: The proposed CGFSeg method effectively addresses challenges in Video Object Segmentation, showcasing its robust performance in real-world complex scenarios.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

*Donghwan Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from single RGB images, focusing on generating probabilistic outputs to handle ambiguity in 3D pose recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D human pose recovery face challenges in balancing accuracy and diversity in probabilistic outputs. Deterministic models lack the ability to account for 3D ambiguity, while probabilistic methods often struggle to compete with state-of-the-art deterministic models.

Method: The authors propose an $SO(3)$ diffusion model that generates pose parameter distributions represented as 3D rotations. A time-independent transformer learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints, and an MLP-based denoising model handles per-joint distributions conditioned on these latent vectors.

Result: The proposed model effectively predicts accurate pose probability distributions and demonstrates improved alignment with 2D observations.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and diversity in probabilistic human pose recovery and sets a framework for well-aligned and effective modeling of 3D poses from single images.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

*Xinyu Pu,Hongsong Wang,Jie Gui,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeoDrag, a geometry-guided drag-based image editing tool that integrates 3D geometry and 2D spatial information for precise and consistent edits, addressing limitations of 2D drag-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome imprecise and inconsistent image edits caused by 2D drag-based methods' limited use of 3D geometry, especially in scenarios requiring geometrically intensive operations like rotations and perspective changes.

Method: The method involves a unified displacement field combining 3D geometric cues with 2D priors for precise edits and introduces a conflict-free partitioning strategy to resolve multi-point drag conflicts and discontinuities.

Result: GeoDrag achieves coherent, high-fidelity, geometry-consistent editing with superior precision and multi-point editability, as validated through diverse editing scenarios and experiments.

Conclusion: GeoDrag provides a reliable and effective solution for drag-based image editing by addressing 2D-only limitations, ensuring structure-consistent and precise results even in challenging geometry-intensive cases.

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

*Mingyang Li,Yimeng Fan,Changsong Liu,Tianyu Zhou,Xin Wang,Yanyan Liu,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents IPDRecon, a method for indoor scene reconstruction leveraging intra-view spatial information to improve robustness, reducing dependency on multiple-view inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing volume-based reconstruction methods significantly depend on geometric constraints across views, leading to issues like degraded performance in view-scarce or unobserved areas. This paper aims to reduce this inter-view dependency while maximizing information retrieval from single views.

Method: The proposed IPDRecon framework includes three innovative components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These work together to decode 3D spatial features embedded in 2D images to enhance reconstruction quality.

Result: IPDRecon demonstrates high stability and performance in reconstruction tasks, with a negligible quality drop despite a 40% reduction in input view count. Key metrics include a coefficient of variation of 0.24%, performance retention of 99.7%, and a maximum quality drop of just 0.42%, validated on the ScanNetV2 dataset.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reduces reliance on multi-view geometric constraints, showcasing its practical viability and robustness in scenarios with limited viewing angles, while maintaining high reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multimodal large language models in generating captions for financial short-form videos using transcripts, audio, and video inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of multimodal models in understanding and captioning financial short-form videos across different topics.

Method: The authors use multimodal inputs including transcripts, audio, video, and their combinations across five defined topics using annotated data from short-form YouTube videos.

Result: Video as a standalone input performs strongly on most topics, while selective combinations like TV and AV often outperform the three-modality setup (TAV), suggesting that excess modalities may introduce noise.

Conclusion: This study defines baselines for captioning financial short-form videos, highlighting the advantages and complexities of leveraging visual and multimodal data in this context.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Method: The study introduces a three-stage training strategy (pretraining, alignment, and refinement) applied to a large, curated multimodal dataset to create two models capable of classification, detection, regression, and reasoning.

Result: Dolphin R1 achieves state-of-the-art results with a U2-score of 0.5835 on the U2-Bench, drastically outperforming other models, while Dolphin v1.0 also performs strongly across tasks.

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ART-VITON, a novel approach for virtual try-on (VITON) systems to ensure realistic garment fitting while preserving identity and background integrity, addressing boundary artifacts and semantic drift issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to solve persistent challenges in virtual try-on systems, particularly preserving identity and background in non-try-on regions and eliminating boundary artifacts that arise from abrupt transitions during garment alignment.

Method: The paper reformulates VITON as a linear inverse problem and utilizes trajectory-aligned solvers. It introduces a measurement-guided diffusion framework (ART-VITON) that features residual prior-based initialization to handle training-inference mismatch and applies artifact-free, measurement-guided sampling with data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising.

Result: ART-VITON demonstrates superior performance on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 datasets, showcasing its ability to preserve the original identity and background, eliminate boundary artifacts, and improve visual fidelity and robustness compared to other methods.

Conclusion: ART-VITON successfully addresses existing limitations in virtual try-on systems, providing a robust and visually appealing solution. It surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in maintaining realism across the try-on and non-try-on regions.

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jia Jun Cheng Xian,Muchen Li,Haotian Yang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Leonid Sigal,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models without relying on costly human annotations, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art diffusion models for T2I generation struggle with ensuring accurate alignment between textual prompts and generated images, and current solutions depend on human-annotated data, which is expensive and limits scalability.

Method: TPO trains models to prefer matched prompts over mismatched ones by perturbing original captions using a large language model. It integrates with preference-based algorithms, extending DPO and KTO into TDPO and TKTO.

Result: The proposed TPO framework consistently surpasses original algorithms on text-to-image alignment benchmarks, demonstrating superior human preference scores and alignment quality.

Conclusion: TPO offers a scalable, annotation-free solution for enhancing text-to-image alignment in diffusion models, proving effective across benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces v-HUB, a benchmark for assessing humor comprehension in multimodal large language models through visual cues in short videos, revealing challenges MLLMs face and the importance of audio in humor understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding humor via AI models can enhance human-machine interaction, necessitating benchmarks to diagnose how these models handle visual humor cues.

Method: The authors created v-HUB, a benchmark using minimal-verbal short videos paired with annotations. They integrated a new video QA task into evaluations and tested various MLLMs involving both open-source and proprietary domains.

Result: Experimental results show MLLMs struggle with humor understanding purely based on visual cues, demonstrating significant performance drops in tasks like caption matching. Incorporating audio enhances results.

Conclusion: Integrating rich mediums like audio with visual cues improves AI humor comprehension, showing the importance of multi-modal approaches for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

### [256] [PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774)
*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses instability in training reinforcement learning for text-to-image (T2I) models by introducing Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), which improves convergence speed and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for T2I models faces issues with training instability and variance, stemming from disproportionate credit assignment across timesteps.

Method: The proposed method, PCPO, ensures proportional credit assignment using objective reformulation and timestep reweighting to stabilize training.

Result: PCPO achieves faster convergence, prevents model collapse, and produces superior image quality compared to baseline methods like DanceGRPO.

Conclusion: PCPO offers a significant improvement in training stability and output quality, establishing itself as a better alternative to existing methods for T2I alignment.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ENM Inversion, a novel technique for editable noise map inversion to improve text-guided image editing with diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing inversion methods where noise map inflexibility restricts adherence to text prompts for desired edits.

Method: ENM Inversion identifies optimal noise maps and incorporates editable noise refinement minimizing differences between the reconstructed and edited versions.

Result: ENM Inversion enhances edit fidelity and content preservation across diverse image editing tasks and can extend to temporally consistent video editing.

Conclusion: The approach significantly advances text-guided editing performance for images and videos, surpassing prior methods in quality and adaptability.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

*Wen Wen,Tianwu Zhi,Kanglong Fan,Yang Li,Xinge Peng,Yabin Zhang,Yiting Liao,Junlin Li,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoQuality, a framework for improving image quality assessment (IQA) in vision-language models without using ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for post-training enhancement of vision-language models rely heavily on costly, human-annotated data, or lack exploration in perceptual tasks such as IQA.

Method: EvoQuality employs self-consistency principles, using the model's pairwise majority voting outputs to create pseudo-labels for ranking quality. These are used as rewards in group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to iteratively enhance model capability.

Result: EvoQuality achieves significant improvements, boosting zero-shot PLCC by 31.8% for IQA and surpassing or matching supervised models on 5 out of 7 benchmarks, all while being self-supervised.

Conclusion: EvoQuality demonstrates that self-supervised approaches can effectively refine VLM's perceptual skills, closing the gap with supervised methods and advancing IQA performance without the need for labeled data.

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG is a novel model that enables more accurate cardiac function prediction using ECGs by leveraging ECHO data and uncertainty-aware embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches depend on expensive and resource-intensive ECHO tests for essential cardiac assessments. Exploring ECG as a simpler alternative can enhance accessibility and expand diagnostic options.

Method: EchoingECG introduces a probabilistic student-teacher model combining Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++) and a pre-trained vision-language model (ECHO-CLIP) to distill ECHO data into ECG representations.

Result: EchoingECG surpasses state-of-the-art foundation models in predicting ECHO metrics using ECG in various scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. It also provides variance estimation to identify uncertainty regions.

Conclusion: EchoingECG represents a significant advancement for ECG-based cardiac assessments, bridging the gap between accessibility and accuracy. Its uncertainty tracking offers insights into model reliability.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

*Haotian Xue,Yunhao Ge,Yu Zeng,Zhaoshuo Li,Ming-Yu Liu,Yongxin Chen,Jiaojiao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Point-It-Out (PIO) benchmark to evaluate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on embodied reasoning through visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate VLMs' embodied reasoning abilities, focusing on image annotation-based multiple-choice tasks rather than precise visual grounding.

Method: The researchers developed the PIO benchmark with a hierarchical evaluation protocol across three stages (localization, task-driven pointing, and trace prediction) using datasets from diverse embodied intelligence domains.

Result: Experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs revealed that general-purpose models like GPT-4o underperform in precise visual grounding compared to some open-source models. Additionally, certain models excel in initial tasks but face challenges in trace prediction.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations in the embodied reasoning abilities of current VLMs and underscores the importance of precise visual grounding, paving the way for further advancements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

*Xintong Jiang,Yixue Liu,Mohamed Debbagh,Yu Tian,Valerio Hoyos-Villegas,Viacheslav Adamchuk,Shangpeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for agricultural computer vision tasks under data-limited field conditions. It effectively addresses tasks like foreground and instance segmentation of small, dense objects with only 4.00M trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of fine-tuning large models like SAM for agricultural tasks, where training data is scarce and field conditions are complex.

Method: The research combines the DSGA module with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune SAM. DSGA applies dynamic similarity graph construction with learnable weight mechanisms and adaptive feature aggregation for robust feature representation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrated significant improvements, including a 17.31% gain in Structure-measure and a 62.36% improvement in adaptive F-measure on chickpea pod datasets. The model showed scalable improvement with increased data shots and achieved strong regression metrics for pod counting.

Conclusion: The adapted SAM with DSGA and LoRA proved effective for agricultural monitoring tasks, offering a parameter-efficient solution with outstanding segmentation and predictive performance in challenging environments.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

*Zichen Liang,Jingjing Fei,Jie Wang,Zheming Yang,Changqing Li,Pei Wu,Minghui Qiu,Fei Yang,Xialei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Logo-VGR, a domain-specific model for logo recognition that generalizes well to unseen brands, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional logo recognition methods struggle with real-world applications where memorizing tens of thousands of brand representations isn't practical.

Method: Logo-VGR reformulates logo recognition as a comparison task, injecting domain knowledge (Logo Perception Grounding) and enhancing reasoning capabilities (Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning).

Result: Experimental results show Logo-VGR achieving nearly a 10-point improvement over baselines in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses key limitations in traditional logo recognition, offering a robust and generalized solution for product moderation scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

TL;DR: The study discusses GeoLifeCLEF 2023, a machine learning challenge that used deep learning to predict plant species distribution based on extensive environmental data across Europe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance species distribution modeling through deep learning and explore effective strategies using remote sensing and environmental variables.

Method: Organized a machine learning competition using a multimodal dataset of 5 million observations and various environmental predictors for a multi-label classification task.

Result: Participants' methods were synthesized, highlighting biases in single positive label models and effective strategies combining single/multi-label data for training.

Conclusion: The research underscores the complexity of multi-label tasks in ecology and showcases how combined label strategies can improve prediction models.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VELA, an advanced automatic evaluation metric designed to assess long image captions effectively. It also proposes LongCap-Arena, a benchmark for testing such metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for image captioning are inadequate for evaluating long and detailed captions. Furthermore, current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches are inefficient due to slow inference and reliance on early fusion of visual information.

Method: The authors developed VELA within an LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework to specifically evaluate long captions. Additionally, they created LongCap-Arena, an extensive benchmark containing images, reference/candidate captions, and human judgments for testing such metrics.

Result: VELA outperformed existing evaluation metrics and demonstrated superhuman performance in the LongCap-Arena benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes VELA as a superior evaluation metric for long image captions and introduces LongCap-Arena as a valuable tool for advancing research in this space.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel training-free framework for reward-guided image editing by optimizing the trajectory in diffusion models, achieving better fidelity and reward alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of image editing where semantic content of the source image must be preserved while aligning with a specific reward-driven objective.

Method: Formulate reward-guided image editing as a trajectory optimal control problem. Use reverse diffusion processes as controllable trajectories and iteratively update adjoint states during editing.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to existing baselines, excelling in balancing reward achievement and fidelity to source images without resorting to reward hacking.

Conclusion: The proposed framework opens new avenues for training-free, reward-guided image editing with strong performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the dual nature of multimodal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs); it improves reasoning but may impair visual grounding. The authors propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) to solve this issue, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the dual nature of multimodal reasoning in VLMs, which enhances logical inference but might weaken perceptual grounding over time.

Method: The authors introduce Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO) that explicitly guides the reasoning process to maintain reliance on visual information.

Result: The proposed method, embodied in VAPO-Thinker-7B, strengthens the model's reliance on visual data and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various established benchmarks.

Conclusion: While multimodal reasoning in VLMs can weaken perceptual abilities, steering reasoning toward visual input with VAPO overcomes this issue, enhancing both reasoning and recognition capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuSLR, a benchmark for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, evaluates current vision-language models (VLMs), and proposes LogiCAM to improve reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning is essential for high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, but current models struggle with these tasks.

Method: The authors developed MuSLR, a benchmark composed of instances from various domains and reasoning depths, and evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs. They also introduced LogiCAM, a modular reasoning framework.

Result: MuSLR reveals limitations in current VLMs, with the best-performing model achieving only 46.8%. LogiCAM improved the performance of GPT-4.1 by 14.13%, particularly in complex logical problems.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack strong capabilities in multimodal symbolic reasoning. LogiCAM enhances performance, but addressing logical misalignment is crucial for further progress.

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named PatchEAD for anomaly detection in industrial settings using visual prompts with foundation models, achieving training-free effectiveness and superior performance without relying on textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current industrial anomaly detection methods that focus on textual prompt tuning, by introducing a unified approach for visual prompting.

Method: Proposes the PatchEAD framework featuring visual prompting techniques such as alignment and foreground masking, compatible with diverse foundation models.

Result: Demonstrates superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to previous work, without utilizing textual features.

Conclusion: A unified patch-only framework like PatchEAD ensures rapid and calibration-light deployment for anomaly detection, bypassing the need for textual prompt engineering.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Motivation: To overcome limitations in spatial understanding by improving the integration of camera and LiDAR data under challenging environmental conditions like low-light scenarios.

Method: A unified pipeline combining LiDAR-camera geometric calibration, low-light image enhancement, multi-camera colour correction, and fusion into colorised point clouds. The setup eliminates specialized calibration targets.

Result: Using a Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and four-camera setup, real-time system performance was achieved with robust colourisation even in minimal lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The paper's method successfully enhances low-light spatial perception with streamlined calibration, delivering reliable colourised point clouds in real-time.

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAPLE, a hierarchical framework that enhances few-shot whole slide image classification by incorporating multi-scale visual semantics and predictions at entity and slide levels for improved cancer diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of slide-level prompting fail to capture fine-grained phenotypic variations of histological entities, limiting the diagnostic accuracy for cancer cases.

Method: MAPLE uses a combination of large language model (LLM)-generated entity and slide-level prompts, cross-attention modules, and cross-scale entity graph learning to refine visual semantic representations for accurate multi-level predictions.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate MAPLE's effectiveness across three distinct cancer cohorts, confirming its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis.

Conclusion: MAPLE addresses critical gaps in existing approaches by integrating multi-scale attributes and hierarchical prediction mechanisms, making it a promising solution for advancing cancer diagnosis with limited annotation data.

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

### [271] [DeepSketcher: Internalizing Visual Manipulation for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25866)
*Chi Zhang,Haibo Qiu,Qiming Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'DeepSketcher,' a dataset and model emphasizing image-text interleaved reasoning for Vision Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Language Models struggle with effective image-interactive reasoning, necessitating advancements in data accuracy, design structures, and applications for deeper multimodal insights.

Method: The authors developed a 31k dataset for chain-of-thought reasoning, alongside a model that generates 'visual thoughts' in the visual embedding space, avoiding external tools.

Result: The proposed model achieves strong performance in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, underlining the dataset's relevance and the novel model's efficacy.

Conclusion: DeepSketcher pushes the boundaries of image-interactive reasoning, offering a flexible, tool-free approach to 'thinking with images' in VLMs.

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM tailored for egocentric data challenges, including diverse motions and dynamic scenarios, providing centimeter-level accurate annotations for urban-scale evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM systems face unique challenges with wearable devices capturing egocentric data, such as diverse motions, dynamic content, and sensor calibration drift, with existing benchmarks insufficiently addressing these issues.

Method: The authors developed a new dataset and benchmark by recording long trajectories with glasses-like devices equipped with sensors, using surveying tools to obtain centimeter-accurate pose annotations.

Result: State-of-the-art SLAM systems struggle with the extreme conditions of the dataset. Components affecting robustness are identified, and tracks of varying difficulty are designed for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable resource for advancing SLAM systems and improving their performance in real-world egocentric applications with challenging conditions.

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces mpLLM, a hierarchical mixture-of-experts model optimized for visual question answering using multi-parametric MRI data. This approach enables efficient training without pretraining, incorporates synthetic VQA data, and achieves significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficient image-text paired supervision and the complexities of handling multi-parametric MRI modalities in medical visual question answering.

Method: mpLLM employs a prompt-conditioned hierarchical MoE model for routing between modality-level and token-level experts. It integrates a synthetic protocol for generating VQA from medical segmentation annotations and collaborates with experts for clinical validation.

Result: The proposed mpLLM outperformed strong baseline models by 5.3% on average across multiple multi-parametric MRI datasets, showcasing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: mpLLM effectively tackles limitations in paired supervision for multi-parametric medical data and demonstrates high utility through clinical validations and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts
and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the
supplementary materials and will release our dataset upon publication.

*Guolei Huang,Qingzhi Peng,Gan Xu,Yuxuan Lu,Yongjun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces safety concerns in multimodal multi-turn (MMT) dialogues, outlines a new dataset (MMDS), and presents LLaVAShield to moderate MMT dialogues effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety risks in multimodal and multi-turn dialogues are difficult to detect using current moderation approaches. Advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require context-sensitive solutions for identifying distributed malicious intents.

Method: The authors created the MMDS dataset, annotated for safety, and developed a multimodal red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). They designed LLaVAShield leveraging MMDS for risk detection and policy-based moderation.

Result: MMDS includes 4,484 annotated dialogues with fine-grained safety classifications and rationales. LLaVAShield demonstrated superior content moderation performance, surpassing baselines under dynamic policy scenarios in experiments.

Conclusion: The study successfully formulated, implemented, and proved a system for addressing safety in MMT dialogues through MMDS and LLaVAShield, achieving state-of-the-art moderation capabilities. Both the dataset and model will be publicly released for broader research.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

*Peng Liu,Haozhan Shen,Chunxin Fang,Zhicheng Sun,Jiajia Liao,Tiancheng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained perception due to difficulty with numeric localization. VLM-FO1 addresses this by reframing localization tasks into robust feature retrieval, using dual vision encoders and token-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs excel at high-level visual understanding but fail at precise localization tasks due to their reliance on language-centric architectures that struggle to generate exact coordinates.

Method: The paper proposes VLM-FO1, which uses a Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE) with dual vision encoders to create detailed region tokens. These tokens allow for token-based referencing, enabling the model to ground and reason about specific visual regions. A two-stage training strategy ensures the base model's general capabilities remain intact.

Result: VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks related to object grounding, region generational understanding, and visual region reasoning.

Conclusion: VLM-FO1 provides a flexible, effective approach to enhance perception-aware capabilities in VLMs without compromising general visual understanding, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and fine-grained localization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

### [276] [The Impact of Scaling Training Data on Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25927)
*Marco Zimmerli,Andreas Plesner,Till Aczel,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper studies adversarial robustness in deep neural networks, showing that data quality, model architecture, and training objectives are more impactful than sheer scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training data characteristics, model architecture, and training strategies impact adversarial robustness in neural networks.

Method: Analysis of 36 state-of-the-art vision models using datasets from 1.2M to 22B images, evaluating robustness against six types of black-box attacks.

Result: Robustness scales logarithmically with data size and model size, but curated data and specific self-supervised methods can outperform sheer dataset scale.

Conclusion: Scaling aids adversarial robustness, but factors like data curation, architecture, and training methods are more critical for resilience.

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

### [277] [UniMMAD: Unified Multi-Modal and Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via MoE-Driven Feature Decompression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25934)
*Yuan Zhao,Youwei Pang,Lihe Zhang,Hanqi Liu,Jiaming Zuo,Huchuan Lu,Xiaoqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniMMAD, a unified framework for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection, addressing limitations in memory overhead and reconstruction inefficiencies in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge fragmented solutions in anomaly detection (AD) research caused by treating modality and class as independent factors. They also seek to address inefficiencies in reconstruction-based approaches when dealing with large domain variations.

Method: UniMMAD employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, using compact general-purpose features during encoding and decompression into specific forms during decoding. The framework incorporates sparsely-gated MoE structures and grouped dynamic filtering to optimize efficiency.

Result: The proposed UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across 9 AD datasets, involving 3 fields, 12 modalities, and 66 classes, while reducing parameter usage by 75%.

Conclusion: UniMMAD effectively combines efficiency and performance improvements, offering a unified solution for anomaly detection that addresses existing challenges in domain variations and high false alarm rates.

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

### [278] [CO3: Contrasting Concepts Compose Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25940)
*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a corrective sampling strategy (CO3) to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image diffusion models, addressing issues like missing or distorted concepts in generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need to address common failure cases in diffusion models, where multi-concept prompts fail to generate balanced and complete representations due to model biases towards single concepts.

Method: The paper proposes CO3, a plug-and-play sampling strategy that avoids areas of strong single-concept dominance while adapting sampling to favorable weight regions, with no need for model retraining.

Result: Experiments demonstrate noticeable improvements in concept representation, balance, and robustness for diverse multi-concept prompts compared to standard baselines and prior methods.

Conclusion: Lightweight corrective sampling can effectively mitigate brittle multi-concept semantic alignment in text-to-image diffusion models, enhancing prompt fidelity and reducing distortions.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

*Longzhen Yang,Zhangkai Ni,Ying Wen,Yihang Liu,Lianghua He,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised framework (SS-ACL) for generating medical reports with visual evidence, overcoming annotation reliance, and achieving high accuracy and efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost of expert annotations and pathology distribution biases in existing medical report generation methods.

Method: SS-ACL uses self-supervised learning with a hierarchical anatomical graph and textual prompts to align reports with anatomical regions. It incorporates intra-sample spatial alignment, attention maps, and inter-sample contrastive learning.

Result: SS-ACL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in report generation (10% improvement in lexical accuracy, 25% in clinical efficacy) and exceeds visual foundation models by 8% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Conclusion: SS-ACL provides an annotation-free, interpretable, and highly effective framework for vision-grounded medical report generation while excelling in downstream visual tasks.

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

*Espen Uri Høgstedt,Christian Schellewald,Annette Stahl,Rudolf Mester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a computer vision-based tracking framework for monitoring salmon welfare by leveraging a pose estimation network and addressing underwater tracking challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Salmon welfare monitoring in aquaculture is important but existing CV methods focus on single indicators, are resource-intensive, and face underwater challenges like object occlusion and similar appearances.

Method: The approach involves using a pose estimation network for high-detail tracking of salmon body parts, specialized modules to address underwater challenges, and datasets for testing ID tracking and tail beat analysis.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for salmon tracking challenges and proves effective for tail beat analysis and welfare monitoring.

Conclusion: This body-part focused tracking framework offers a flexible, automated solution to improve aquaculture monitoring, outperforming current methods and addressing key challenges.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PinPoint3D introduces an interactive framework for fine-grained, part-level 3D segmentation using minimal user input to address limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D segmentation methods struggle with coarse outputs, sparse real-world data, and insufficient annotations, hindering embodied AI's ability to perform precise manipulation tasks.

Method: PinPoint3D employs a novel interactive framework and a 3D data synthesis pipeline to enable multi-granularity segmentation from user clicks and generates a new dataset with dense part annotations.

Result: Experiments show PinPoint3D achieves an average IoU of 55.8% with one click and 71.3% with additional clicks, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by 16% in IoU and precision.

Conclusion: PinPoint3D effectively addresses bottlenecks in fine-grained segmentation, improving machine perception for complex 3D object interaction in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes RH-Partial2Global, an improved version of Partial2Global, to enhance Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) performance by addressing sampling limitations and providing a more reliable selection of in-context examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current VICL methods, specifically the insufficient justification of their similarity-priority assumption and inefficient sampling strategies like those used in Partial2Global.

Method: The authors introduce RH-Partial2Global, which incorporates a jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy for reliable alternative sets construction and a covering design-based sampling strategy for thorough and uniform pairwise preference sampling.

Result: RH-Partial2Global demonstrates significant performance improvements over Partial2Global across various visual tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed RH-Partial2Global method addresses identified shortcomings in Partial2Global's global ranking process and proves its efficacy in adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, as evidenced by experimental results.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Motivation: The paper addresses the computational challenges posed by traditional attention mechanisms in video editing models, particularly for long-duration and high-resolution videos.

Method: The VRWKV-Editor integrates a bidirectional weighted key-value recurrence mechanism from the RWKV transformer into diffusion-based video editing models, enabling linear complexity while maintaining global dependencies and temporal coherence.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 3.7x faster processing speed, 60% reduced memory usage, and maintains competitive results in frame consistency and text alignment compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-time high-resolution video editing, proving particularly advantageous for long video sequences where traditional self-attention models struggle.

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

### [284] [Learning Egocentric In-Hand Object Segmentation through Weak Supervision from Human Narrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26004)
*Nicola Messina,Rosario Leonardi,Luca Ciampi,Fabio Carrara,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Fabrizio Falchi,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task and model to segment in-hand objects in egocentric vision using narration-based weak supervision, eliminating the need for fine-grained annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in recognizing objects in egocentric images without relying on costly manual pixel-level annotations, enabling applications such as assistive technologies and activity monitoring.

Method: They propose NS-iHOS, a task leveraging natural-language narrations for weak supervision, and WISH, an end-to-end model, which distills knowledge from these narrations to segment objects during inference without their use.

Result: WISH outperforms several baselines and recuperates over 50% of the performance compared to fully supervised object segmentation methods using datasets like EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D.

Conclusion: Narration-based weak supervision is a viable alternative to manual annotations for in-hand object recognition, showcasing potential in reducing costs and improving segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

*Hanwei Zhu,Yu Tian,Keyan Ding,Baoliang Chen,Bolin Chen,Shiqi Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgenticIQA, a framework combining vision-language models with IQA tools to enhance distortion detection, analysis, and explanation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IQA methods struggle with adaptability to varying distortions, user-specific concerns, and integrated scoring and explanation processes.

Method: The AgenticIQA framework structures IQA into four subtasks using a modular design with a planner, executor, and summarizer, leveraging vision-language models.

Result: AgenticIQA outperforms traditional baselines in scoring accuracy and alignment with human explanations, validated through a new dataset and evaluation benchmark.

Conclusion: AgenticIQA provides a dynamic, query-aware approach that improves interpretability and adaptability in IQA applications, addressing the limitations of conventional systems.

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

*Zhiwei Zhang,Ruikai Xu,Weijian Zhang,Zhizhong Zhang,Xin Tan,Jingyu Gong,Yuan Xie,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PFDepth, a framework for depth estimation using pinhole and fisheye cameras, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery for accurate multi-view depth estimation.

Method: PFDepth uses a unified architecture, lifting 2D features into a 3D space, employing a Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion module, and a novel 3D Gaussian representation for depth mapping.

Result: PFDepth outperforms existing depth networks on the KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets.

Conclusion: PFDepth provides systematic insights into heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation and establishes a benchmark in the field.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

*Rajendra K. Ray,Manish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model for better denoising, addressing blocky artifacts seen with second-order models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order PDE models often produce block artifacts during denoising, prompting the need for improvement.

Method: The model combines diffusion and wave properties guided by Laplacian and intensity values, targeting grayscale and color image denoising.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance in PSNR, MSSIM, and SI metrics compared to second-order methods.

Conclusion: The model effectively reduces noise while preserving details and texture, showing consistent results for grayscale and color images.

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

*Yuqi Xiao,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR introduces a two-stage pipeline for improving zero-shot composed image retrieval by filtering irrelevant features and refining results with a semantic-enhanced re-ranking mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) performance while addressing limitations of current CLIP-based methods, such as irrelevant background details and lack of fine-grained semantic relations.

Method: Proposed a two-stage retrieval method (SETR): 1) Coarse retrieval filters irrelevant elements using an intersection-driven fusion approach, and 2) Fine-grained re-ranking leverages a multimodal LLM adapted with Low-Rank Adaptation for binary semantic judgments.

Result: SETR achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO datasets, with up to a 15.15-point improvement in Recall@1 on CIRR.

Conclusion: Two-stage reasoning, combining coarse filtering and nuanced re-ranking, represents a robust and scalable paradigm for zero-shot composed image retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

*Lubian Bai,Xiuyuan Zhang,Siqi Zhang,Zepeng Zhang,Haoyu Wang,Wei Qin,Shihong Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLink integrates OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into remote sensing foundation models to bridge modality gaps, improving geospatial intelligence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing (RS) foundation models mainly focus on imagery and lack effective integration of ground-level geospatial data like OSM. Addressing modality gaps in data is needed to enhance geospatial intelligence tasks.

Method: GeoLink introduces multimodal learning by leveraging OSM data during both pretraining and downstream stages through multi-granularity learning signals and cross-modal spatial correlations. The framework also incorporates image mask-reconstruction for efficient pretraining.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that OSM data integration improves RS image encoder performance during pretraining and enhances model adaptability for diverse geographic tasks in downstream scenarios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the value of multimodal integration and the role of spatial correlation in advancing geospatial AI. The provided resources aim to encourage broader adoption of these methods.

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

*Shian Du,Menghan Xia,Chang Liu,Xintao Wang,Jing Wang,Pengfei Wan,Di Zhang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PatchVSR, a method for generative video super-resolution (VSR) using patch-based adaptation of pre-trained video diffusion models, achieving competitive 4K VSR efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for full-size VSR using pre-trained models face issues like high computational demands and fixed output resolution. This inspired the exploration of patch-wise VSR to overcome these limitations.

Method: PatchVSR integrates a dual-stream adapter wherein the patch branch handles content fidelity and the global branch uses resized video to capture broader context. It adds patch location information into the model and proposes a multi-patch joint modulation to ensure consistency.

Result: The method successfully generates high-resolution, high-fidelity video patches and ensures consistency across them, achieving competitive performance in 4K VSR efficiently.

Conclusion: PatchVSR demonstrates that employing a patch-based paradigm for VSR can overcome the limitations of full-size models, enabling efficient and flexible video super-resolution with superior results.

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight framework called Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP) to tackle Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization using spatial noise guided by causal masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address OOD generalization challenges, especially in biomedical imaging, by focusing on causal mechanisms often overlooked by existing methods.

Method: The proposed CGP framework uses spatially varying Gaussian noise guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers to emphasize causal features over spurious correlations.

Result: Experiments on the WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 dataset show consistent performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art OOD baselines.

Conclusion: Causal perturbation is a promising approach for improving OOD generalization, offering both reliability and interpretability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeMoBridge, a lightweight method to address intra-modal misalignment in CLIP's embeddings, particularly improving few-shot classification by mapping images into the text modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome intra-modal misalignment in CLIP embeddings, which hinders few-shot classification performance due to the modality gap and CLIP's training objective.

Method: SeMoBridge maps images into the text modality via a Semantic Modality Bridge. The method is lightweight, can include multi-modal supervision, and combines image-text alignment losses for optimization.

Result: SeMoBridge-T outperforms existing methods, especially in low-data few-shot classification scenarios, while requiring significantly less training time.

Conclusion: SeMoBridge directly solves embedding misalignment, offering better few-shot classification performance with efficiency, providing a practical alternative to prior approaches.

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMMER, a model for detecting multimodal manipulation, struggles with global scene inconsistencies. To enhance its robustness, a segmentation-guided scoring pipeline is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER performs well in detecting manipulations but fails to identify when foregrounds are misplaced in implausible backgrounds, highlighting the need for improved handling of global inconsistencies.

Method: The paper introduces segmentation-guided scoring (SGS), which uses masks to differentiate foreground and background, computes region-specific coherence scores, and integrates these scores with HAMMER's predictions without retraining.

Result: The SGS pipeline improves detection of global manipulations with negligible computational overhead, enhancing both detection accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Region-aware reasoning, such as segmentation-guided scoring, is critical for robust multimodal manipulation detection and disinformation identification.

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper extends the DGM4 dataset by introducing 5,000 samples with global inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched foreground and background) and hybrid manipulations to tackle inadequacies in detecting multimodal disinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing datasets like DGM4, which focus only on local manipulations, and to capture the increasing prevalence of global inconsistencies in real-world forged multimedia.

Method: By leveraging OpenAI's generative models and tailored prompts, the authors created 5,000 human-centric images blending plausible individuals with absurd or impossible contexts. They also introduced three manipulation categories, enforced quality control protocols, and structured captions in varying levels of manipulation.

Result: The extended DGM4+ dataset fills a crucial gap by including global mismatches and hybrids, providing a foundation for evaluating multimodal manipulations which current models struggle with.

Conclusion: DGM4+ builds upon prior work by expanding its scope to test both local and global reasoning, aiming to better evaluate and enhance models detecting multimodal disinformation.

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

*Ioana Ciuclea,Giorgio Longari,Alice Barbara Tumpach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometry-based method to avoid data augmentation while addressing symmetries in computer vision and medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current classification tasks in vision and medical datasets often rely on data augmentation to account for symmetries such as rotation and scaling, which is computationally expensive.

Method: The authors use the concept of sections of principal fiber bundles to account for symmetries. They measure dissimilarities on object space using simple metrics and optimize sections to enhance class separations.

Result: The proposed method effectively handles symmetries with dissimilarity measures and offers parameterizations that include constant-speed parameterization.

Conclusion: This geometry-based approach provides a sustainable alternative to data augmentation, with potential applications across varied domains.

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

*Seamie Hayes,Ganesh Sistu,Ciarán Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by foundation models (Grounded-SAM and Metric3Dv2) for semantic occupancy prediction, yielding significant performance improvements with reduced computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in self-supervised semantic occupancy prediction methods, such as high computational costs and memory usage during training, and lack of transferability across architectures.

Method: Propose 3D pseudo-ground-truth labels using foundation models and temporal information for label densification, integrating these labels easily into existing models and introducing a streamlined model, EasyOcc.

Result: Implementation of 3D pseudo-labels improved mIoU by 45% for the OccNeRF model (from 9.73 to 14.09). EasyOcc achieved mIoU of 13.86 and state-of-the-art performance of 7.71 mIoU for full-scene evaluation without a camera mask.

Conclusion: Foundation models, temporal context, and optimized loss computation are critical for advancing self-supervised scene understanding with significant computational efficiency and model performance improvements.

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

*Pasindu Ranasinghe,Pamudu Ranasinghe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time AI system predicts penalty kick direction using deep learning on video input with outstanding 89% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goalkeepers need to predict penalty kicks in very short timeframes, and accurate prediction can influence match outcomes significantly.

Method: A multi-modal system combines a CNN and an LSTM with attention mechanisms using both RGB frames and 2D pose keypoints.

Result: Achieved 89% prediction accuracy, surpassing baselines by 14-22%, on a dataset of 755 penalty kicks, with inference in 22 milliseconds.

Conclusion: The system is accurate, fast, and practical for training, tactical analysis, and real-time applications.

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

*Frédéric Berdoz,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Nick Tuninga,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reason-3D is a text-to-scene synthesis model leveraging large reasoning models to generate 3D environments from textual prompts, excelling in complex geometry adherence and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in current text-to-scene methods, such as struggling with complex geometries, object transformations, and weak adherence to detailed instructions.

Method: Reason-3D retrieves objects using captions describing attributes (physical, functional, contextual), strategically places them with layout constraints, and uses collision-aware spatial reasoning for refinement.

Result: Reason-3D shows superior performance in visual fidelity, compliance with constraints, and asset retrieval quality, particularly with complex indoor scene configurations.

Conclusion: The study advances text-to-scene generation with better spatial reasoning and demonstrates the utility of large reasoning models for this field, with code released for further research.

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

### [299] [EchoGen: Generating Visual Echoes in Any Scene via Feed-Forward Subject-Driven Auto-Regressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26127)
*Ruixiao Dong,Zhendong Wang,Keli Liu,Li Li,Ying Chen,Kai Li,Daowen Li,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EchoGen, a subject-driven generation framework built on Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models, which combines efficient sampling and high-quality output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for subject-driven generation struggle with the trade-off between efficiency and quality: either requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning processes or involving slow inference speeds with diffusion-based architectures.

Method: EchoGen employs a dual-path injection strategy using a semantic encoder for abstract identity extraction and a content encoder for capturing fine details. It integrates these through decoupled cross-attention and multi-modal attention mechanisms.

Result: EchoGen demonstrates subject fidelity and image quality comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods but with significantly reduced sampling latency.

Conclusion: EchoGen provides an efficient and high-fidelity solution for subject-driven generation, establishing itself as the first feed-forward framework using VAR models. This enhances both quality and efficiency in the field.

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

### [300] [EntroPE: Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26157)
*Sachith Abeywickrama,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Xiaoli Li,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntroPE introduces entropy-guided patching for time series forecasting, improving accuracy and efficiency by preserving temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based time series models use naive patch construction which disregards temporal structures, fracturing coherence and weakening representation learning.

Method: EntroPE dynamically detects transition points using conditional entropy to place patch boundaries, leveraging an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE).

Result: Experiments on long-term forecasting benchmarks reveal improved forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency with EntroPE.

Conclusion: EntroPE, with its entropy-guided dynamic patching, offers a new paradigm for effective and efficient time series forecasting, preserving temporal structures.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually curating challenging edge cases for datasets is labor-intensive and a bottleneck in improving AI performance.

Method: The approach uses a fine-tuned large language model to generate diverse prompts, which guide a text-to-image generation model in creating difficult visual scenarios.

Result: The method outperformed naive augmentation and manual prompts on the FishEye8K object detection benchmark.

Conclusion: This framework reduces manual effort by automating targeted data synthesis, paving the way for more robust and continuously advancing AI systems.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable
and continuously improving AI systems. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper presents Human-MME, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in human-centric scene understanding, focusing on diversity, progressive evaluation, and high-quality annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs that focus on human-centric scenes and higher-dimensional causal reasoning abilities.

Method: The authors created the Human-MME benchmark, which spans diverse human-centric scenes, features progressive evaluation dimensions, and employs an automated annotation pipeline complemented by manual labeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrated limitations in current models and highlighted areas for improvement in human-centric image understanding.

Conclusion: Human-MME paves the way for more holistic and precise evaluation of MLLMs in the context of human-centric scenes, offering tools and insights to drive future improvements in the field.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how pedestrian detectors for autonomous vehicles perform across different poses and occlusions, assessing fairness with statistical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian detection is crucial for autonomous driving safety, but fairness across different pedestrian poses and occlusions has not been adequately investigated.

Method: The paper uses the ECP-DP dataset to evaluate five pedestrian-specific and three general-purpose detection models, analyzing bias via Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) and employing Z-tests for statistical robustness.

Result: Cascade R-CNN has the best overall performance and the least bias. Pedestrian poses with parallel legs, straight elbows, and lateral views, as well as lower body occlusions, negatively affect detection rates.

Conclusion: This is the first systematic study focusing on fairness in pedestrian detection for AD, highlighting specific pose and occlusion-related biases and identifying a top-performing model.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

TL;DR: AttriGen is a framework for automated multi-attribute annotation in cell microscopy, achieving 94.62% accuracy using CNN and Vision Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-attribute classification in cell microscopy is underrepresented compared to traditional cell type categorization.

Method: A dual-model architecture combining a CNN for cell type classification and a Vision Transformer for multi-attribute classification.

Result: Achieved 94.62% accuracy in multi-attribute classification using the AttriGen framework, enhancing interpretability, time, and cost efficiency.

Conclusion: AttriGen sets a new standard for automating multi-attribute annotation, with potential extensions to other computer vision tasks.

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of effective methods and datasets for text-driven saliency detection in 360-degree videos.

Method: The authors developed the TSV360 dataset and proposed the TSalV360 method, which integrates a vision-language model, a similarity estimation module, and a spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanism.

Result: The TSalV360 method demonstrated competitive performance against state-of-the-art visual-based approaches, showing its effectiveness for customized saliency detection.

Conclusion: TSalV360 successfully enables text-driven saliency detection in 360-degree videos and sets a benchmark using the TSV360 dataset.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

*Chenyang Jiang,Zhengcen Li,Hang Zhao,Qiben Shan,Shaocong Wu,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GSDD, a dataset distillation method using sparse 2D Gaussian representations to encode critical information for efficient and scalable synthetic dataset creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiency and redundancy in conventional dataset distillation methods that rely on dense pixel-level representations, which are computationally intensive and challenging to scale.

Method: GSDD uses sparse 2D Gaussian primitives to encode discriminative information in a distilled dataset, incorporating CUDA-based splatting operators to ensure parallel processing with minimal computational burden.

Result: The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets, demonstrating both efficiency and accuracy in representation and training tasks.

Conclusion: GSDD is a scalable, effective, and efficient dataset distillation approach, making it broadly applicable across different pipelines while reducing computational and storage requirements.

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization by extending an existing framework with a multimodal model and evaluating explanation plausibility using semantic overlap metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and interpreting AI decisions in video summarization through plausible explanations, aligned with human reasoning, is critical for enhancing trust and usability in AI systems.

Method: The approach integrates the LLaVA-OneVision model to generate descriptions for visual explanations and assesses their plausibility using sentence embedding methods (SBERT, SimCSE) by quantifying semantic overlap between textual summaries and visual explanations.

Result: The study analyzes whether more faithful explanations are also more plausible and identifies suitable approaches for generating plausible textual explanations using datasets like SumMe and TVSum.

Conclusion: This research contributes an improved framework and a novel evaluation method for generating and measuring the plausibility of textual explanations in video summarization, bridging the gap between AI interpretation and human expectations.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

*Haiyang Zheng,Nan Pu,Wenjing Li,Nicu Sebe,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGCE, a framework that addresses Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) by leveraging multi-granularity conceptual data and automatically estimating the number of categories in unlabeled datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Generalized Category Discovery struggle with representation quality due to limited multi-granularity conceptual use and rely on knowing the number of unlabeled categories, which is unrealistic in open-world scenarios.

Method: The MGCE framework includes two modules: Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL) to optimize feature learning and category discovery, and Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL) to incorporate cross-expert collaboration for improved knowledge integration.

Result: MGCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on nine fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, demonstrating an average improvement of 3.6% in novel-class accuracy over parametric approaches despite not using prior knowledge about category numbers.

Conclusion: The MGCE framework integrates multi-granularity knowledge for better category discovery in open-world settings, eliminates the need for prior category count knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in accuracy across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

### [309] [IMG: Calibrating Diffusion Models via Implicit Multimodal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26231)
*Jiayi Guo,Chuanhao Yan,Xingqian Xu,Yulin Wang,Kai Wang,Gao Huang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework called Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), which addresses multimodal alignment challenges in diffusion-generated images without requiring extra data or image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of achieving precise multimodal alignment between generated images and their input prompts, as prior methods struggle with limited high-quality data or cause image quality trade-offs.

Method: IMG works by using a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify misalignments in generated images, employing an Implicit Aligner to adjust diffusion conditioning features, and formulating a trainable objective called Iteratively Updated Preference Objective to iteratively improve alignment.

Result: The method demonstrates superiority over existing alignment techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on models like SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX. Additionally, it can be used as a modular component to enhance other finetuning-based alignment methods.

Conclusion: IMG is a novel and effective solution for enhancing multimodal alignment without additional data or compromising image quality, and it provides a plug-and-play advantage for improving other alignment techniques.

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Donut-MINT, a compressed Vision-Language Model for document Visual Question Answering, using knowledge distillation and interpretability techniques to optimize model efficiency while preserving strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models for document Visual Question Answering are effective but resource-intensive, necessitating cost-efficient alternatives.

Method: Knowledge distillation is used to compress models, guided by mechanistic interpretability to optimize student architectures by retaining essential components and approximating less critical ones.

Result: The proposed Donut-MINT model effectively reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining robust performance on a document Visual Question Answering benchmark, DocVQA.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability offers a valuable framework for model compression, enabling efficient deployment of Vision-Language Models without compromising effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging

### [311] [Seeing Space and Motion: Enhancing Latent Actions with Spatial and Dynamic Awareness for VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26251)
*Zhejia Cai,Yandan Yang,Xinyuan Chang,Shiyi Liang,Ronghan Chen,Feng Xiong,Mu Xu,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work proposes Farsighted-LAM, a vision-language-action (VLA) framework addressing spatial understanding and temporal perception limitations in prior latent action models (LAMs), achieving state-of-the-art performance in simulation and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome bottlenecks in LAMs, such as poor spatial understanding and fragile temporal perception when dealing with distant input frames, which hamper stable action modeling.

Method: Introduces Farsighted-LAM with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, and SSM-VLA, an end-to-end framework integrating structured perception and Chain-of-Thought reasoning for dynamic environments.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art results on multiple VLA tasks across both simulated and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of geometric modeling, temporal coherence, and reasoning significantly enhances robustness and generalizability in embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

*Tuan Nguyen,Naseem Khan,Khang Tran,NhatHai Phan,Issa Khalil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of multimodal large language models in deepfake detection by introducing a new dataset and a reinforcement learning algorithm, PRPO, which improves detection accuracy and reasoning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection remains a critical challenge for online safety due to the scarcity of large, high-quality datasets and poor performance of multimodal LLMs in reasoning aligned with visual evidence.

Method: The authors introduce a reasoning-annotated dataset and propose PRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that aligns multimodal reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.

Result: Experiments show PRPO significantly improves detection accuracy, achieving a reasoning score of 4.55/5.0, and outperforms GRPO during testing.

Conclusion: Grounding multimodal reasoning in visual evidence is crucial for advancing reliable and interpretable deepfake detection models.

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

### [313] [Cat: Post-training quantization error reduction via cluster-based affine transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26277)
*Ali Zoljodi,Radu Timofte,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT), a framework to improve post-training quantization (PTQ) for low-bit regimes, addressing accuracy degradation through error-reduction using cluster-specific parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the accuracy degradation in low-bit PTQ, especially under the 2-bit regime, a refined approach is needed to effectively map quantized outputs to full-precision counterparts.

Method: The paper proposes CAT, which uses cluster-specific affine transformation parameters for error reduction. The framework does not require fine-tuning of the model or quantization settings but integrates these transformations to align outputs.

Result: Experiments show CAT consistently improves PTQ performance across architectures and settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18 and enhancing existing PTQ methods by over 3%.

Conclusion: Cluster-based Affine Transformation is a cost-efficient solution for enhancing PTQ in low-bit scenarios, offering significant accuracy improvements and broad applicability without extensive computational requirements.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

*Edoardo Bianchi,Jacopo Staiano,Antonio Liotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProfVLM evaluates skill using generative vision-language techniques, offering both proficiency assessment and expert feedback from video inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve skill proficiency estimation by addressing shortcomings in prior models like lack of explainability and multi-view context.

Method: Uses a compact model combining video features from TimeSformer with a language model for feedback generation. Employs AttentiveGatedProjector for feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters and faster training time, while providing explainable, natural language feedback.

Conclusion: Generative vision-language modeling is effective for accurate skill assessment and explainable feedback.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

### [315] [Point2RBox-v3: Self-Bootstrapping from Point Annotations via Integrated Pseudo-Label Refinement and Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26281)
*Teng Zhang,Ziqian Fan,Mingxin Liu,Xin Zhang,Xudong Lu,Wentong Li,Yue Zhou,Yi Yu,Xiang Li,Junchi Yan,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the inefficiencies in point-supervised oriented object detection by introducing Point2RBox-v3, which utilizes a dynamic label assignment method and a new mask loss technique for better pseudo-label quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to reduce the cost and effort of manual labeling for oriented object detection by learning from point annotations using a weakly-supervised framework.

Method: Point2RBox-v3 introduces two key innovations: (1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA) to dynamically estimate instance sizes during training for effective label assignment and (2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss) to handle the challenges of sparse and dense object scenes by improving upon previous methods.

Result: Point2RBox-v3 achieved competitive results in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences, with notable performance on datasets such as DOTA-v1.0 (66.09%) and DOTA-v2.0 (41.28%).

Conclusion: The proposed Point2RBox-v3 is efficient and versatile, combining dynamic pseudo labels and advanced loss functions to achieve strong performance in both sparse and dense object detection scenes. It offers a practical solution for reducing manual labeling effort.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

*Mehrsa Pourya,Bassam El Rawas,Michael Unser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flower is a solver for inverse problems that achieves state-of-the-art results by leveraging pre-trained flow models through a three-step iterative process and theoretical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problems require reconstructing data from limited or corrupted information. Flower seeks to unify methods and improve reconstruction quality.

Method: Flower uses a three-step iterative process: (1) estimating flow-consistent destinations, (2) refining projections onto feasible sets, and (3) time progression along the flow trajectory.

Result: Flower demonstrates state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across multiple inverse problems with nearly identical hyperparameter configurations.

Conclusion: Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, offering a unified perspective and practical effectiveness in diverse inverse problem settings.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

### [317] [Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with 3D Fourier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26325)
*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a new approach for space-time video super-resolution using a continuous 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF) representation, achieving state-of-the-art results in spatial and temporal quality while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video super-resolution rely on separately handling spatial and temporal aspects and explicit frame warping, which can be ineffective and computationally expensive. This research seeks to develop a unified, efficient representation for video super-resolution.

Method: The authors propose a 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF) that encodes videos in a continuous, spatio-temporally coherent manner. This representation uses Fourier-like coefficients predicted by a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on the low-resolution input video.

Result: The proposed approach achieves sharper and more temporally consistent super-resolved videos than existing baselines across various upscaling factors. It also outperforms prior methods in computational efficiency and achieves new benchmarks in both spatial and temporal super-resolution.

Conclusion: The VFF representation demonstrates the ability to jointly model spatial and temporal aspects in videos, providing more accurate and computationally efficient results than traditional methods. This approach establishes a new standard in video super-resolution techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SQUARE, a training-free framework leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for performing zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) with enhanced accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in capturing user intent for zero-shot composed image retrieval, which combines visual and textual information without requiring task-specific training or labeled data.

Method: The method involves a two-stage framework: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) to enrich query embeddings using MLLM-generated captions for better semantic understanding, and Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) where an image grid is reranked through joint visual-semantic reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate strong performance of the SQUARE framework across four CIR benchmarks, attaining high retrieval accuracy even with lightweight pre-trained models.

Conclusion: SQUARE is a simple yet effective approach that enhances zero-shot CIR capabilities, proving its scalability and applicability while bypassing the need for expensive training or labeled datasets.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents \mname, a reward model trained on a large human preference dataset for improving instruction-guided image editing tasks. It shows state-of-the-art performance and aids in scaling high-quality training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of high-quality reward models for improving open-source image editing models guided by natural language prompts.

Method: The authors introduced \mname, trained on a meticulously annotated 200K-pair human preference dataset, rigorous protocol, and used it to refine noisy datasets.

Result: \mname demonstrated superior human preference alignment on benchmarks like GenAI-Bench and AURORA-Bench. It improves training data quality by extracting subsets from noisy datasets, enhancing performance.

Conclusion: The model \mname significantly improves alignment and the quality of synthetic training data for image editing. It paves the way for reinforcement learning-based tasks and community adoption via dataset release.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG) for identifying relevant time intervals in long videos based on task descriptions, with a new benchmark and a framework called TimeScope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable improved understanding and reasoning in long videos by identifying key moments relevant to specific task descriptions.

Method: Proposed TimeScope framework, which uses progressive reasoning combining coarse-grained scope identification with fine-grained moment partitioning. Also curated ToTG Pile dataset for training and evaluation.

Result: The proposed TimeScope framework outperforms existing temporal-grounding models and multimodal large language models effectively across various settings.

Conclusion: TimeScope is an effective solution for the new ToTG problem, addressing challenges of generalizability and long video processing.

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScalingAR, a test-time scaling (TTS) framework for next-token prediction autoregressive image generation, improving performance and efficiency without relying on early decoding or external rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing TTS approaches that are unsuitable for next-token prediction image generation due to intermediate decoding issues.

Method: ScalingAR integrates token entropy as a visual token signal and operates on two levels: Profile Level (confidence calibration) and Policy Level (adaptive trajectory termination and dynamic conditioning).

Result: ScalingAR improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, reduces visual token usage by 62.0%, and enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in tough scenarios.

Conclusion: ScalingAR effectively boosts performance and efficiency in next-token prediction autoregressive image generation and shows strong robustness under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

*Zhiwei Yang,Chen Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PANDA, an AI-based agent designed for video anomaly detection (VAD) in various scenarios without requiring domain-specific training data or manual adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalizable system for video anomaly detection that eliminates dependency on training data or manual adjustments, addressing the limitations of traditional methods.

Method: PANDA integrates four key capabilities: self-adaptive scene strategies, heuristic reasoning, tool-augmented reflection, and a chain-of-memory mechanism to adapt, detect, and improve anomaly identification in videos.

Result: PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse, open-set, and complex scenarios without the need for training data or manual input.

Conclusion: PANDA demonstrates the ability to generalize across scenarios effectively, paving the way for an advanced, autonomous approach to video anomaly detection.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MotionRAG, a framework addressing challenges in generating videos with realistic motion using retrieval-augmented techniques and motion adaptation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately modeling motion in video generation, which involves physical constraints, object interactions, and domain-specific dynamics, is challenging and not easily generalized.

Method: The framework augments motion realism via motion priors adapted from reference videos using techniques like motion feature extraction through video encoders, causal transformers for adaptation, and motion injection adapters integrated into video diffusion models.

Result: Experiments show MotionRAG significantly improves motion realism across multiple domains, base models, and enables zero-shot generalization using updated retrieval databases.

Conclusion: MotionRAG enhances video generation by enabling effective retrieval and transfer of motion priors, leading to realistic motion dynamics synthesis.

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

*Atakan Topaloglu,Ahmet Bilican,Cansu Korkmaz,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel procedural methods for identifying visual performance variations in super-resolution image models based on image difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for image super-resolution primarily rely on average scores, which fail to account for differences in difficulty among images and overlook the artifacts models may produce on challenging samples.

Method: The authors introduce two new difficulty measures, the high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict variations in model performance on specific images. They also propose an evaluation methodology that accentuates these performance differences in objective assessments.

Result: The experimental findings confirm the efficacy of the proposed image-difficulty metrics and the enhanced evaluation methodology, demonstrating improved differentiation between super-resolution models.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a more nuanced approach to evaluate SISR models, emphasizing the importance of difficulty-aware performance metrics for fairer model comparisons.

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

Motivation: Image deraining is critical for enhancing visual clarity in applications like autonomous driving, where current models fail in fine-grained and globally consistent recovery.

Method: The method involves PRISM, a progressive framework with three components: CENet for coarse feature extraction, SFNet for frequency fusion using hybrid domains, and RNet for refining original resolution details.

Result: PRISM efficiently captures high-frequency rain characteristics and maintains global consistency; it outperforms previous deraining methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: PRISM represents a significant improvement in image deraining through innovative attention mechanisms and domain modeling, providing high-quality output and enhancing clarity in visual tasks.

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

### [326] [Post-Training Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26436)
*Donghoon Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Ik Joon Chang,Sung-Ho Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes QuaRTZ, a 4-bit post-training quantization scheme for diffusion models, enhancing texture fidelity while reducing computational inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel at image generation but are computationally intensive. While 8-bit post-training quantization preserves quality, extending this to 4-bit remains challenging due to rounding errors that degrade texture fidelity.

Method: QuaRTZ combines 8-bit min-max quantization for handling outliers with 4-bit compression using leading-zero suppression to retain fine texture details. It balances outlier preservation and LSB precision.

Result: Empirical evaluations show QuaRTZ achieves an FID score of 6.98 on FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming other methods like SVDQuant that use auxiliary FP16 branches.

Conclusion: QuaRTZ demonstrates high generalizability and efficiency in 4-bit quantization, offering a viable solution for reducing computational demands in diffusion models while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

*Yash Kulkarni,Raman Jha,Renu Kachhoria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Automated Vehicle Inspection (AVI) platform for ensuring vehicle quality using a multi-view AI system with real-time inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing complexity of ensuring vehicle variants adhere to specifications and are defect-free during production.

Method: A multi-view system using 11 synchronized cameras, combined with deep-learning models and a semantic rule engine, performs real-time detection and validation of vehicle parts and defects.

Result: The AVI platform achieved a 93% verification accuracy, 86% defect-detection recall, and processes 3.3 vehicles per minute, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: AVI is the first end-to-end system that integrates multi-camera feature and defect validation, demonstrating its deployability and effectiveness in industrial automotive quality control.

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

*Hanzhou Liu,Jia Huang,Mi Lu,Srikanth Saripalli,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos introduces a novel Transformer-based framework for 3D style transfer, enabling geometry-aware and view-consistent stylization of unposed scenes from various input categories and styles, without needing pose estimation or per-scene tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in achieving view-consistent geometric stylization in 3D style transfer, especially when processing unposed content across varied styles and scenes, without complex precomputations.

Method: Stylos combines a Transformer backbone with dual pathways for geometry prediction and style application. It introduces a voxel-based 3D style loss to align scene features with style statistics, ensuring view consistency and geometric fidelity.

Result: Experiments indicate that Stylos achieves high-quality, zero-shot 3D stylization across diverse datasets, handling single-view to multi-view content and unseen categories effectively.

Conclusion: Stylos showcases significant advancements in achieving scalable, geometry-aware, and view-consistent 3D style transfer, benefiting a wide range of applications in single to multi-view large-scale scenarios.

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ASGRA, a framework for indoor scene classification using scene graphs and graph attention networks. It surpasses traditional image-based methods in accuracy and preserves privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of intricate object relationships and complex spatial layouts in indoor scene classification, especially for tasks like CSAI classification.

Method: Convert images into scene graphs, then apply a Graph Attention Network to model component interactions while ensuring explainability and privacy.

Result: Achieved 81.27% accuracy on Places8 dataset and 74.27% accuracy in real-world CSAI classification, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: Structured scene representations using ASGRA are effective, accurate, explainable, and privacy-preserving for indoor scene classification and CSAI classification.

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

*Sumaiya Tabassum,Md. Faysal Ahamed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a lightweight CBAM-CNN model to identify betel leaf diseases with high accuracy using an enriched dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Betel leaf plants suffer from diseases threatening their economic value, necessitating AI-based solutions for timely detection to prevent losses.

Method: A CBAM-CNN model with 2.13 million parameters incorporating attention mechanisms was trained on 10,185 images of healthy and diseased leaves.

Result: The model achieved 95.58% accuracy, along with 97% precision, 94% recall, and an F1 score of 95%, outperforming traditional CNNs.

Conclusion: The CBAM-CNN model efficiently classifies betel leaf diseases while offering interpretability using Grad-CAM, showcasing AI's potential in agriculture.

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

*Sattwik Basu,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Jorge Vančo Sampedro,Srihari Nelakuditi,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses reconstructing floorplans from user movements using a diffusion-based posterior sampler and reformulates the likelihood score for smoother optimization in an embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of reconstructing spatial layouts like floorplans from movements, where direct inversion is ill-posed due to multiple plausible solutions.

Method: The authors reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space trained with a contrastive loss that aligns compatible floorplans and trajectories, making the reconstruction process more stable.

Result: The proposed model, CoGuide, delivers more consistent floorplan reconstructions and surpasses differentiable-planner and guided-diffusion baselines in robustness.

Conclusion: Reformulating the likelihood score in an embedding space enables effective posterior sampling for spatial layout reconstruction, highlighting the validity of the approach.

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

*Hongyu Chen,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UML-CoT, a framework that uses Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams for structured reasoning and planning in large language models, significantly outperforming unstructured methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting methods are limited in structured reasoning, lacking constructs like abstraction and inheritance, which are vital for tasks needing interpretability and executability.

Method: The authors use UML diagrams (class and activity diagrams) for compositional semantics and procedural control flow. This is combined with a three-stage training pipeline using supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: UML-CoT was tested on MRoom-30k (a benchmark for room-cleaning scenarios) and showed improvements in interpretability, coherent planning, and execution success when compared to unstructured CoTs.

Conclusion: Unified Modeling Language provides a more structured and actionable framework for reasoning and planning, enhancing the capability of language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of large language models, such as their high computational costs, by developing efficient smaller models that can perform well in resource-constrained edge environments.

Method: The authors introduce a post-training pipeline that leverages curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning and offline on-policy knowledge distillation to improve small model accuracy.

Result: The instruction-tuned small model achieves state-of-the-art performance among billion-parameter models and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities under strict hardware constraints.

Conclusion: This work offers a practical solution for deploying high-performance language models in edge scenarios, striking a balance between computational efficiency and task accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

*Gabriel A. Viana,Luis F. Alves Pereira,Tsang Ing Ren,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Jan Sijbers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to optimize perceptual losses for enhancing Low-Dose CT image quality. It emphasizes the importance of proper loss design choices and provides concrete guidelines for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-wise losses for LDCT enhancement lead to over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details. The paper aims to explore and optimize perceptual losses as a better alternative.

Method: The authors introduce 'perceptual influence,' a metric that quantifies the contribution of perceptual loss in model training. Systematic experiments evaluate various design choices, including feature representation level and encoder pretraining data, within the proposed framework.

Result: The study shows that commonly used perceptual loss configurations underperform and that better-designed loss structures significantly improve noise reduction and structural fidelity in LDCT images without altering the network architecture.

Conclusion: Optimized perceptual loss designs enhance LDCT image quality, providing superior results compared to conventional setups. The paper also offers statistical guidelines for their effective implementation in denoising tasks.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEPTHOR++, a depth completion framework addressing noise and misalignment in dToF sensors using RGB guidance, and achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve depth perception in tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM, addressing issues of noise, anomalies, and misalignment in real-world dToF sensor data.

Method: DEPTHOR++ enhances depth completion using synthetic training data, anomaly detection mechanisms, and a custom depth completion network that leverages RGB guidance and pre-trained depth priors.

Result: DEPTHOR++ improves depth completion models' RMSE and Rel by up to 22% and 11% on the ZJU-L5 dataset and outperforms previous state-of-the-art by 37% in mirror regions on the Mirror3D-NYU dataset.

Conclusion: DEPTHOR++ is a robust framework for improving depth perception even with noisy or low-cost dToF sensors, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability across datasets.

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models and benchmarks fail to meet the complexity and needs of professional video generation.

Method: The authors propose Stable Cinemetrics, which formalizes filmmaking controls into four hierarchical taxonomies (Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera), constructs a benchmark with professional prompts, and trains an automatic evaluation model aligned with expert annotations.

Result: A large-scale human study with 10+ models and 20K videos reveals significant gaps in existing models, especially in Event and Camera controls. The automatic evaluator outperforms prior zero-shot baselines.

Conclusion: Stable Cinemetrics is the first approach to align professional video generation with filmmaking requirements, providing robust taxonomies and evaluation pipelines to support further advancements in the field.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the bottleneck in EM connectomics caused by the high cost and labor of manual proofreading efforts, limiting scalability and comparative studies.

Method: The paper proposes training machine learning models using existing ground-truth data obtained from manual annotations to automate and optimize proofreading workflows.

Result: The approach reduces costs by 80% in proofreading workflows, achieves 90% efficiency, and automatically merges segmentation fragments equivalent to four years of manual work, increasing completion rate by 1.3%.

Conclusion: The approach successfully reduces human labor and cost in connectome reconstructions, making larger and comparative studies more feasible.

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of fixed and non-modifiable depth-of-field effects in photography, enabling photos to be re-focused even after they are created.

Method: It uses a diffusion transformer framework and a simulated pipeline to generate training data with varying focus planes and bokeh levels. A stacking constraint is introduced to ensure precise refocusing.

Result: Through extensive experiments, the model achieves stable and accurate refocusing across diverse scenes, significantly enhancing DoF control.

Conclusion: DiffCamera facilitates flexible and accurate depth-of-field adjustments, paving the way for advanced photographic and generative AI applications.

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

### [340] [Video Object Segmentation-Aware Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26604)
*Ilpo Viertola,Vladimir Iashin,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduced SAGANet, a model enabling precise, object-level audio generation using video object segmentation maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal audio generation models lack precise control for professional workflows, often focusing on whole scenes instead of specific object sounds.

Method: Proposed SAGANet, a generative model that incorporates segmentation maps, video, and textual cues for fine-grained audio control. Developed a dataset, Segmented Music Solos, for evaluation.

Result: The model shows substantial improvement over existing methods, achieving better visually-localized and controllable audio synthesis.

Conclusion: SAGANet sets a new standard for high-fidelity, controllable Foley synthesis, advancing segmentation-aware audio generation in multimedia.

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

### [341] [Hy-Facial: Hybrid Feature Extraction by Dimensionality Reduction Methods for Enhanced Facial Expression Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26614)
*Xinjin Li,Yu Ma,Kaisen Ye,Jinghan Cao,Minghao Zhou,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework combining deep learning and traditional techniques, achieving 83.3% classification accuracy on a facial expression recognition dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression classification is difficult due to the high dimensionality and complexity of facial image data.

Method: The framework combines deep features from VGG19 with handcrafted descriptors (SIFT, ORB) and applies UMAP for dimensionality reduction alongside K-means clustering.

Result: Hy-Facial achieved 83.3% classification accuracy using its hybrid approach on the FER dataset.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction enhances feature quality, thereby improving classification performance, and is essential in the proposed pipeline.

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

### [342] [DA$^2$: Depth Anything in Any Direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26618)
*Haodong Li,Wangguangdong Zheng,Jing He,Yuhao Liu,Xin Lin,Xin Yang,Ying-Cong Chen,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DA$^{2}$, a novel 360° panoramic depth estimation model with superior zero-shot generalization, spherical distortion mitigation, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of panoramic data limits previous methods to in-domain settings, compromising their zero-shot generalization capabilities and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a data curation mechanism to generate panoramic depth data from perspective and develop SphereViT to leverage spherical geometry for optimal performance.

Result: DA$^{2}$ achieves a 38% improvement in AbsRel metric compared to the strongest zero-shot baseline and outperforms other in-domain methods while being more efficient.

Conclusion: DA$^{2}$ offers state-of-the-art performance and efficiency in panoramic depth estimation, supporting scalable and generalizable 3D vision applications.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

### [343] [HART: Human Aligned Reconstruction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26621)
*Xiyi Chen,Shaofei Wang,Marko Mihajlovic,Taewon Kang,Sergey Prokudin,Ming Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HART is a framework for reconstructing clothed human meshes from sparse uncalibrated images, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human reconstruction struggle with loose garments, human-object interactions, and real-world settings due to reliance on parametric templates or simplified assumptions.

Method: HART predicts 3D point maps, normals, and body correspondences per pixel, uses occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction for complete geometry, and combines this with SMPL-X body models for alignment and Gaussian splats for rendering.

Result: HART improves Chamfer Distance by 18-23%, decreases PA-V2V by 6-27%, and reduces LPIPS for novel-view synthesis by 15-27%, demonstrating strong performance across datasets.

Conclusion: HART demonstrates that feed-forward transformers can effectively address the challenges of sparse-view human reconstruction, merging geometry and rendering capabilities into a unified real-world solution.

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

### [344] [Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631)
*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of 3D shape completion under varying poses and scales by introducing an SIM(3)-equivariant network that generalizes better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D shape completion rely on pre-aligned data, leading to overfitting to absolute positions and poor generalization when alignment cues are unavailable in real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed method incorporates SIM(3)-equivariance into the network architecture to ensure invariance to pose and scale, enabling the processing of similarity-invariant geometry while restoring the original frame afterward.

Result: The SIM(3)-equivariant network outperformed both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark, achieved state-of-the-art results on KITTI and OmniObject3D datasets, and demonstrated superior performance even under stricter evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: Full SIM(3)-equivariance is proven to be a powerful design principle for robust and generalizable 3D shape completion, addressing issues of pose and scale variability.

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

### [345] [Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641)
*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Query-Kontext, a novel approach that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion-based generators for advanced multimodal reasoning and image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) are limited in combining multimodal generative reasoning (such as instruction understanding and identity preservation) with high-quality visual synthesis.

Method: Query-Kontext bridges VLM and diffusion models using a multimodal "kontext" composed of semantic cues and coarse image conditions, paired with a three-stage training strategy: connecting VLM to a lightweight diffusion model, scaling to a large pre-trained diffusion model, and adding a low-level image encoder for fidelity.

Result: The proposed approach performs comparably to strong unified frameworks and surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific methods in certain multimodal use cases.

Conclusion: Query-Kontext successfully enhances multimodal generative reasoning and high-fidelity synthesis in UMMs while maintaining scalability and versatility for diverse applications.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stitch, a training-free method to address spatial relationship challenges in Text-to-Image generation using bounding boxes and targeted attention heads to achieve spatially accurate and visually appealing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern T2I generation models struggle with precise spatial relationships, and existing position control methods are incompatible with newer architectures that prioritize image quality.

Method: Stitch leverages automatically-generated bounding boxes and targeted attention heads within Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers to isolate objects mid-generation and stitch them together.

Result: Stitch achieves significant improvements in position-based image generation tasks, enhancing models like FLUX and Qwen-Image by over 200% and 54% respectively on specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: Stitch integrates spatial position control into leading models training-free and sets state-of-the-art results on position-based evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free method (TTT3R) for enhancing the generalization of memory-based models in 3D reconstruction tasks, achieving improved performance while maintaining high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recurrent neural networks struggle with length generalization during 3D reconstruction tasks, leading to degraded performance beyond training contexts.

Method: The authors propose TTT3R, a memory update mechanism guided by closed-form learning rate derived from alignment confidence between memory state and new observations, facilitating better balance between old and new data.

Result: TTT3R achieves a 2x improvement in global pose estimation compared to baselines and operates efficiently at 20 FPS using only 6 GB of GPU memory.

Conclusion: TTT3R enhances length generalization in 3D reconstruction, advancing the reliability and efficiency of recurrent neural network models without the need for additional training.

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

### [348] [Permuting Transactions in Ethereum Blocks: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25415)
*Jan Droll*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the feasibility of randomized transaction ordering in Ethereum by analyzing protocol violations, execution errors, and gas consumption deviations through permutation experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address centralization effects and improve fairness in the Ethereum ecosystem by examining randomized transaction ordering.

Method: The authors permuted and executed transactions from over 335,000 Ethereum blocks multiple times to study protocol violations, execution errors, and gas consumption deviations.

Result: Approximately 22% of block permutations were invalid, mainly due to privately mined transactions or blocks near their gas limits, while almost all execution errors occurred in privately mined transactions. Gas consumption deviations were minimal for most blocks and transactions.

Conclusion: Randomized transaction ordering could be technically feasible with careful transaction selection to reduce invalid blocks and errors.

Abstract: Several recent proposals implicitly or explicitly suggest making use of
randomized transaction ordering within a block to mitigate centralization
effects and to improve fairness in the Ethereum ecosystem. However,
transactions and blocks are subject to gas limits and protocol rules. In a
randomized transaction order, the behavior of transactions may change depending
on other transactions in the same block, leading to invalid blocks and varying
gas consumptions. In this paper, we quantify and characterize protocol
violations, execution errors and deviations in gas consumption of blocks and
transactions to examine technical deployability. For that, we permute and
execute the transactions of over 335,000 Ethereum Mainnet blocks multiple
times. About 22% of block permutations are invalid due to protocol violations
caused by privately mined transactions or blocks close to their gas limit.
Also, almost all transactions which show execution errors under permutation but
not in the original order are privately mined transactions. Only 6% of
transactions show deviations in gas consumption and 98% of block permutations
deviate at most 10% from their original gas consumption. From a technical
perspective, these results suggest that randomized transaction ordering may be
feasible if transaction selection is handled carefully.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel frameworks, SSFL and BSFL, to address limitations in existing split and federated learning systems, focusing on scalability, performance, and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome existing limitations in Federated Learning and Split Learning, such as computational inefficiency, prolonged training times, scalability, and security vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors developed SSFL to distribute workloads across parallel shards and BSFL to replace centralized servers with a blockchain-based architecture. BSFL also incorporates mechanisms to secure model integrity.

Result: Experimental results showed that SSFL improved scalability by 85.2% and performance by 31.2%, while BSFL increased resilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7%.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks, SSFL and BSFL, significantly improve scalability, performance, and security in collaborative learning environments, making BSFL the first decentralized SplitFed Learning system with blockchain integration.

Abstract: Collaborative and distributed learning techniques, such as Federated Learning
(FL) and Split Learning (SL), hold significant promise for leveraging sensitive
data in privacy-critical domains. However, FL and SL suffer from key
limitations -- FL imposes substantial computational demands on clients, while
SL leads to prolonged training times. To overcome these challenges, SplitFed
Learning (SFL) was introduced as a hybrid approach that combines the strengths
of FL and SL. Despite its advantages, SFL inherits scalability, performance,
and security issues from SL. In this paper, we propose two novel frameworks:
Sharded SplitFed Learning (SSFL) and Blockchain-enabled SplitFed Learning
(BSFL). SSFL addresses the scalability and performance constraints of SFL by
distributing the workload and communication overhead of the SL server across
multiple parallel shards. Building upon SSFL, BSFL replaces the centralized
server with a blockchain-based architecture that employs a committee-driven
consensus mechanism to enhance fairness and security. BSFL incorporates an
evaluation mechanism to exclude poisoned or tampered model updates, thereby
mitigating data poisoning and model integrity attacks. Experimental evaluations
against baseline SL and SFL approaches show that SSFL improves performance and
scalability by 31.2% and 85.2%, respectively. Furthermore, BSFL increases
resilience to data poisoning attacks by 62.7% while maintaining superior
performance under normal operating conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
BSFL is the first blockchain-enabled framework to implement an end-to-end
decentralized SplitFed Learning system.

*Brian Kelley,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAPIS, an MLIR-based compiler, designed to address the challenges of portability, performance, and productivity in programming models, particularly for computational science and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the issues arising from the lack of a unified programming model that excels in portability, performance, and productivity, while also addressing integration difficulties between disparate frameworks like those in computational science and machine learning.

Method: LAPIS is developed as a compiler leveraging MLIR with a dialect grounded in the Kokkos ecosystem principles, enabling automatic lowering of linear algebra kernels and code integration across frameworks like PyTorch and Kokkos.

Result: LAPIS successfully automates the integration of sparse and dense linear algebra kernels, facilitates framework interoperability, and achieves competitive kernel performance on diverse architectures.

Conclusion: LAPIS provides a promising solution for unified programming challenges, ensuring portability, extensibility, and interoperability without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Portability, performance, and productivity are three critical dimensions for
evaluating a programming model or compiler infrastructure. Several modern
programming models for computational science focus on performance and
portability. On the other end, several machine learning focused programming
models focus on portability and productivity. A clear solution that is strong
in all three dimensions has yet to emerge. A second related problem arises when
use cases from computational science converge with machine learning. The
disparate popular frameworks of these fields require programmers to manually
integrate codes written in different frameworks. Finally, several programming
frameworks lack easy options for extensibility as any new computer architecture
change require complex changes to the programming models. We present LAPIS, an
MLIR-based compiler that addresses all three of these challenges. We
demonstrate that LAPIS can automatically lower sparse and dense linear algebra
kernels from computational science and artificial intelligence use cases. We
also show how LAPIS facilitates the integration of codes between PyTorch and
Kokkos. We compare kernel performance with the default MLIR implementations on
diverse architectures to demonstrate portability. By developing a dialect that
is built on the principles of the Kokkos ecosystem, LAPIS also allows
extensibility of the framework to new architectures.

### [352] [Efficient Construction of Large Search Spaces for Auto-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26253)
*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Rob V. van Nieuwpoort,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a CSP-based approach to improve the efficiency of search space construction in auto-tuning, significantly reducing computation time while maintaining flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-tuning accelerates high-performance codes, but constructing search spaces is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating scalability issues in real-world applications.

Method: The authors reformulated the search space construction problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and developed an optimized solution using a runtime parser, solver optimizations, and open-source tools.

Result: The proposed solution reduces construction time significantly: four orders of magnitude versus brute-force methods, three orders of magnitude versus unoptimized CSP solvers, and one to two orders of magnitude compared to leading chain-of-trees-based frameworks.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable CSP-based approach that eliminates critical bottlenecks in auto-tuning, enabling the exploration of larger and more complex problem spaces efficiently.

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning, or auto-tuning, accelerates high-performance
codes by exploring vast spaces of code variants. However, due to the large
number of possible combinations and complex constraints, constructing these
search spaces can be a major bottleneck. Real-world applications have been
encountered where the search space construction takes minutes to hours or even
days. Current state-of-the-art techniques for search space construction, such
as chain-of-trees, lack a formal foundation and only perform adequately on a
specific subset of search spaces.
  We show that search space construction for constraint-based auto-tuning can
be reformulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Building on this
insight with a CSP solver, we develop a runtime parser that translates
user-defined constraint functions into solver-optimal expressions, optimize the
solver to exploit common structures in auto-tuning constraints, and integrate
these and other advances in open-source tools. These contributions
substantially improve performance and accessibility while preserving
flexibility.
  We evaluate our approach using a diverse set of benchmarks, demonstrating
that our optimized solver reduces construction time by four orders of magnitude
versus brute-force enumeration, three orders of magnitude versus an unoptimized
CSP solver, and one to two orders of magnitude versus leading auto-tuning
frameworks built on chain-of-trees. We thus eliminate a critical scalability
barrier for auto-tuning and provide a drop-in solution that enables the
exploration of previously unattainable problem scales in auto-tuning and

### [353] [PAST: Pilot and Adaptive Orchestration for Timely and Resilient Service Delivery in Edge-Assisted UAV Networks under Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25700)
*Houyi Qi,Minghui Liwang,Liqun Fu,Sai Zou,Xinlei Yi,Wei Ni,Huaiyu Dai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A novel trading framework, PAST, is proposed to improve UAV networks by combining predictive planning and real-time adjustments for better resource utilization and mission performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trading mechanisms like spot and futures trading exhibit inefficiencies in dynamic UAV-edge environments due to delays and inflexibility.

Method: PAST integrates two mechanisms: PilotAO for initial overbooking-enabled agreements and AdaptAO for real-time updates based on UAV mobility, supply-demand, and agreement performance.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PAST excels in overhead reduction, latency improvement, resource utilization, and social welfare compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PAST provides a robust and adaptive resource trading framework that enhances UAV mission performance, balancing stability and flexibility.

Abstract: Incentive-driven resource trading is essential for UAV applications with
intensive, time-sensitive computing demands. Traditional spot trading suffers
from negotiation delays and high energy costs, while conventional futures
trading struggles to adapt to the dynamic, uncertain UAV-edge environment. To
address these challenges, we propose PAST (pilot-and-adaptive stable trading),
a novel framework for edge-assisted UAV networks with spatio-temporal dynamism.
PAST integrates two complementary mechanisms: PilotAO (pilot trading agreements
with overbooking), a risk-aware, overbooking-enabled early-stage
decision-making module that establishes long-term, mutually beneficial
agreements and boosts resource utilization; and AdaptAO (adaptive trading
agreements with overbooking rate update), an intelligent adaptation module that
dynamically updates agreements and overbooking rates based on UAV mobility,
supply-demand variations, and agreement performance. Together, these mechanisms
enable both stability and flexibility, guaranteeing individual rationality,
strong stability, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that PAST consistently
outperforms benchmark methods in decision-making overhead, task completion
latency, resource utilization, and social welfare. By combining predictive
planning with real-time adjustments, PAST offers a valuable reference on robust
and adaptive practice for improving low-altitude mission performance.

### [354] [Accelerating LLM Inference with Precomputed Query Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25919)
*Jay H. Park,Youngju Cho,Choungsol Lee,Moonwook Oh,Euiseong Seo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: StorInfer reduces LLM inference latency by precomputing and storing query-response pairs and instantly retrieving them for semantically similar queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the latency challenges faced during LLM inference, especially in resource-constrained environments like on-device or edge deployments, aiming to improve response efficiency.

Method: StorInfer uses LLM-driven generation of diverse query-response pairs via adaptive query masking and adaptive sampling. The pairs are embedded and indexed in a disk-backed vector database for fast similarity-based retrieval.

Result: StorInfer generates 150K unique precomputed pairs, reduces latency by up to 17.3% without sacrificing response quality, and demonstrates practicality and scalability in predictable query environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages storage to enable low-latency and efficient LLM inference, presenting a scalable solution, especially for predictable query distributions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high latency,
particularly in resource-constrained environments such as on-device or edge
deployments. To address this challenge, we present StorInfer, a novel
storage-assisted LLM inference system that accelerates response time by
precomputing and storing predictable query-response pairs offline. When a user
query semantically matches a precomputed query, StorInfer bypasses expensive
GPU inference and instantly returns the stored response, significantly reducing
latency and compute costs. To maximize coverage and effectiveness, StorInfer
employs an LLM-driven generator that adaptively produces diverse and
deduplicated queries based on a given knowledge base. This is achieved via two
techniques: adaptive query masking, which prevents regeneration of similar
queries, and adaptive sampling, which dynamically tunes generation parameters
to promote semantic diversity. The resulting query-response pairs are embedded
and indexed using a disk-backed vector database to enable fast,
similarity-based retrieval at runtime. Using this approach, we generated 150K
unique precomputed pairs (taking up to 830 MB of storage space), achieving up
to 17.3% latency reduction with no loss in response quality. Our evaluation
across multiple QA datasets demonstrates the practicality and scalability of
storage-assisted inference, especially in scenarios with predictable query
distributions. StorInfer highlights a promising direction in leveraging storage
as a primary enabler for efficient, low-latency LLM deployment.

### [355] [Enabling Time-Aware Priority Traffic Management over Distributed FPGA Nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26043)
*Alberto Scionti,Paolo Savio,Francesco Lubrano,Federico Stirano,Antonino Nespola,Olivier Terzo,Corrado De Sio,Luca Sterpone*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper extends an open-source NIC implementation (Corundum) to enable time-aware traffic management for controlling bandwidth by associating transmission queues with prioritized traffic classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern NICs have evolved into complex systems capable of offloading various tasks from host CPUs. However, integrating time-aware traffic management into such NICs is challenging. This study aims to enhance NIC functionality by adding hardware-based traffic control features to manage bandwidth efficiently.

Method: The authors augmented the Corundum NIC implementation by introducing time-aware traffic management. They exposed dedicated control registers on the AXI bus to configure the transmission bandwidth of prioritized queues. These were linked to different traffic classes via the Linux QDISC mechanism.

Result: The experimental evaluation showed that the extended NIC design effectively managed the bandwidth allocation for various traffic flows, ensuring efficient and proper distribution of network resources.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that incorporating time-aware traffic management into NIC designs can provide fine-grained control over bandwidth allocation, enhancing network performance.

Abstract: Network Interface Cards (NICs) greatly evolved from simple basic devices
moving traffic in and out of the network to complex heterogeneous systems
offloading host CPUs from performing complex tasks on in-transit packets. These
latter comprise different types of devices, ranging from NICs accelerating
fixed specific functions (e.g., on-the-fly data compression/decompression,
checksum computation, data encryption, etc.) to complex Systems-on-Chip (SoC)
equipped with both general purpose processors and specialized engines
(Smart-NICs). Similarly, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) moved from pure
reprogrammable devices to modern heterogeneous systems comprising
general-purpose processors, real-time cores and even AI-oriented engines.
Furthermore, the availability of high-speed network interfaces (e.g., SFPs)
makes modern FPGAs a good choice for implementing Smart-NICs. In this work, we
extended the functionalities offered by an open-source NIC implementation
(Corundum) by enabling time-aware traffic management in hardware, and using
this feature to control the bandwidth associated with different traffic
classes. By exposing dedicated control registers on the AXI bus, the driver of
the NIC can easily configure the transmission bandwidth of different
prioritized queues. Basically, each control register is associated with a
specific transmission queue (Corundum can expose up to thousands of
transmission and receiving queues), and sets up the fraction of time in a
transmission window which the queue is supposed to get access the output port
and transmit the packets. Queues are then prioritized and associated to
different traffic classes through the Linux QDISC mechanism. Experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the approach allows to properly manage the
bandwidth reserved to the different transmission flows.

*Kuan-Wei Lu,Ding-Yong Hong,Pangfeng Liu,Jan-Jan Wu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents a distributed deep learning method using a novel dual batch size learning scheme combined with cyclic progressive learning to balance training efficiency and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the accuracy loss due to poor generalization when using large batch sizes for distributed machine learning training.

Method: The authors propose a dual batch size learning scheme, which combines larger batch sizes for efficiency and smaller ones for better generalization, alongside a cyclic progressive learning scheme to manage image resolution dynamically during training.

Result: Tests with ResNet-18 show improved accuracy (3.3% on CIFAR-100 and 0.1% on ImageNet) and reduced training time (10.6% for CIFAR-100 and 35.7% for ImageNet).

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively enhances model generalization and training efficiency for large-scale deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning is critical for training deep learning models on
large datasets and with numerous parameters. Current research primarily focuses
on leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to
accelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often
employed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can
lead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method
built on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training
efficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support
while incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By
using two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing
loss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time.
Additionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning,
we propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually
adjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly
boosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual
batch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and
training efficiency. Experimental results using ResNet-18 show that, compared
to conventional training methods, our method can improve accuracy by 3.3% while
reducing training time by 10.6% on CIFAR-100, and improve accuracy by 0.1%
while reducing training time by 35.7% on ImageNet.

### [357] [Parallax: Efficient LLM Inference Service over Decentralized Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26182)
*Chris Tong,Youhe Jiang,Gufeng Chen,Tianyi Zhao,Sibian Lu,Wenjie Qu,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai,Binhang Yuan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents Parallax, a decentralized approach for efficiently deploying large language models on heterogeneous GPU pools with constrained resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current centralized deployment of large language models is resource-intensive, requiring specialized hardware and infrastructure, making it costly. A decentralized approach offers potential cost savings but introduces scheduling challenges due to varied GPU capacities and network limitations.

Method: The paper introduces Parallax, a system with a two-phase scheduler. The process involves model allocation, distributing LLM layers across GPUs while optimizing for latency and throughput, and request-time GPU pipeline selection to dynamically balance loads and adapt to availability during execution.

Result: Experiments show Parallax consistently reduces latency and increases throughput compared to other decentralized methods. This demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging volunteer heterogenous GPUs effectively for LLM inference.

Conclusion: Decentralized GPU pools can be efficiently utilized for LLM inference with proper scheduling, making this a cost-effective alternative to centralized GPU clusters.

Abstract: Deploying a large language model (LLM) inference service remains costly
because centralized serving depends on specialized GPU clusters and
high-bandwidth interconnects in datacenters. An appealing alternative is to
leverage collaborative decentralized GPU pools. However, heterogeneity in GPU
and limited interconnected network bandwidth, along with potentially dynamic
availability, make efficient scheduling the central challenge in this scenario.
In this paper, we present Parallax, a decentralized LLM serving system that
turns a pool of heterogeneous GPUs into an efficient inference platform via a
two-phase scheduler. Parallax decomposes planning into (i) model allocation,
which places layers of each replica across diverse GPUs to jointly optimize
latency and throughput under memory and link-bandwidth constraints, and (ii)
request-time GPU pipeline selection, which stitches layers from different
replicas into end-to-end execution chains that balance load and adapt to
current conditions. We implement Parallax and evaluate it on open-source LLMs
deployed over real volunteer nodes. Parallax consistently reduces latency and
increases throughput relative to decentralized baselines, demonstrating that
principled scheduling can make volunteer compute a practical, affordable
substrate for LLM inference.

### [358] [I Like To Move It -- Computation Instead of Data in the Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26193)
*Fabian Czappa,Marvin Kaster,Felix Wolf*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper tackles the computational challenges in brain simulations, specifically focusing on scalable solutions for updating synaptic connectivity (structural plasticity) and spike communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the human brain's functioning requires scalable brain simulations to complement experimental research, yet current computational demands make this challenging.

Method: Proposed a new algorithm that shifts computation instead of data, reducing communication overhead significantly compared to existing methods.

Result: Achieved a sixfold reduction in connectivity update time and improved spike exchange time by more than two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The algorithm presents a promising approach to enhance scalability in brain simulation models, aiding in more efficient computational neuroscience research.

Abstract: The detailed functioning of the human brain is still poorly understood. Brain
simulations are a well-established way to complement experimental research, but
must contend with the computational demands of the approximately $10^{11}$
neurons and the $10^{14}$ synapses connecting them, the network of the latter
referred to as the connectome. Studies suggest that changes in the connectome
(i.e., the formation and deletion of synapses, also known as structural
plasticity) are essential for critical tasks such as memory formation and
learning. The connectivity update can be efficiently computed using a
Barnes-Hut-inspired approximation that lowers the computational complexity from
$O(n^2)$ to $O(n log n)$, where n is the number of neurons. However, updating
synapses, which relies heavily on RMA, and the spike exchange between neurons,
which requires all-to-all communication at every time step, still hinder
scalability. We present a new algorithm that significantly reduces the
communication overhead by moving computation instead of data. This shrinks the
time it takes to update connectivity by a factor of six and the time it takes
to exchange spikes by more than two orders of magnitude.

### [359] [CSnake: Detecting Self-Sustaining Cascading Failure via Causal Stitching of Fault Propagations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26529)
*Shangshu Qian,Lin Tan,Yongle Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces CSnake, a framework for exposing self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems by leveraging causal stitching and fault causality analysis (FCA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current failure detection techniques struggle to identify cascading failures in distributed systems due to their complexity and sequence of fault propagations activated by distinct conditions.

Method: CSnake performs fault injections and uses causal stitching with counterfactual causality analysis (FCA) to identify complex fault propagation chains. It employs a three-phase allocation protocol and local compatibility checks to optimize the identification process.

Result: CSnake successfully identified 15 bugs in five systems, including self-sustaining cascading failures, with five confirmed and two fixed.

Conclusion: CSnake proves effective in exposing challenging cascading failures, providing valuable insights into improving distributed system reliability.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that self-sustaining cascading failures in
distributed systems frequently lead to widespread outages, which are
challenging to contain and recover from. Existing failure detection techniques
struggle to expose such failures prior to deployment, as they typically require
a complex combination of specific conditions to be triggered. This challenge
stems from the inherent nature of cascading failures, as they typically involve
a sequence of fault propagations, each activated by distinct conditions.
  This paper presents CSnake, a fault injection framework to expose
self-sustaining cascading failures in distributed systems. CSnake uses the
novel idea of causal stitching, which causally links multiple single-fault
injections in different tests to simulate complex fault propagation chains. To
identify these chains, CSnake designs a counterfactual causality analysis of
fault propagations - fault causality analysis (FCA): FCA compares the execution
trace of a fault injection run with its corresponding profile run (i.e., same
test w/o the injection) and identifies any additional faults triggered, which
are considered to have a causal relationship with the injected fault.
  To address the large search space of fault and workload combinations, CSnake
employs a three-phase allocation protocol of test budget that prioritizes
faults with unique and diverse causal consequences, increasing the likelihood
of uncovering conditional fault propagations. Furthermore, to avoid incorrectly
connecting fault propagations from workloads with incompatible conditions,
CSnake performs a local compatibility check that approximately checks the
compatibility of the path constraints associated with connected fault
propagations with low overhead.
  CSnake detected 15 bugs that cause self-sustaining cascading failures in five
systems, five of which have been confirmed with two fixed.

*Hanyuan Gao,Xiaoxuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Norm-Q, a normalized linear quantization method to compress Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) by significantly reducing bit widths, achieving high compression rates with minimal impact on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of neuro-symbolic AI systems, specifically the inefficiencies related to dense computation, data transfer, and communication between neural networks and symbolic reasoning components.

Method: The proposed method, Norm-Q, employs a normalized quantization-aware expectation maximization during probabilistic model training to compress HMMs effectively.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that Norm-Q successfully quantizes HMMs with up to 4096 hidden states, achieving compression rates of up to 99%, while maintaining reasonable score loss.

Conclusion: Norm-Q offers an efficient solution for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, significantly reducing hardware resource usage and enabling deployment on custom hardware without compromising performance.

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlashOmni, a unified sparse attention engine for efficient deployment of Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, successfully optimizing sparse computations and significantly accelerating performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) face computational challenges, limiting deployment. Current sparsity-based acceleration methods require customized kernels, restricting their universality.

Method: FlashOmni introduces flexible sparse symbols and optimized sparse GEMMs for standardized representation and execution of diverse sparsity strategies, enabling efficient computation within a single attention kernel.

Result: FlashOmni achieves near-linear speedup closely matching sparsity ratios in attention computations and significant acceleration ratios (2.5x-3.8x) in GEMM-$O$, while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: FlashOmni provides a universal, efficient platform for accelerating DiTs through innovative sparsity strategies, ensuring practical deployment without compromising performance or quality.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

Motivation: Current methods for designing molecules targeting proteins are slow and overly complex, necessitating streamlined approaches.

Conclusion: SOLD offers a promising, efficient molecule generation approach, with avenues for improvement and scalability through additional data.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug

SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multimodal framework combining vision and language to enhance jigsaw puzzle-solving by leveraging textual context and a hierarchical semantic alignment module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional jigsaw-solving methods rely on visual cues and fail to incorporate semantic guidance, especially in challenging puzzles with missing or eroded pieces.

Method: The paper introduces the Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns visual patches with textual descriptions using multi-level semantic matching, combined with a multimodal architecture for cross-modal reasoning.

Result: The proposed approach achieves significant advancements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, with a 14.2 percentage point improvement in piece accuracy across various datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating multimodal semantic insights, especially the VLHSA module, is vital for solving jigsaw puzzles and establishes a new paradigm for puzzle-solving tasks.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in EEG artifact detection, including inefficiency of multi-channel methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and complexity-accuracy trade-offs in current deep learning models.

Method: A hybrid framework combining time-domain low-pass filtering for EOG, frequency-domain PSD for EMG, PCA-optimized feature fusion, and a lightweight MLP architecture for artifact classification.

Result: Achieved 99% accuracy at low SNRs (-7 dB) and >90% accuracy at moderate noise (4 dB). For simultaneous multi-source contamination, the method maintains 96% accuracy. Training times are 97% faster compared to CNNs.

Conclusion: The method bridges clinical applicability and computational efficiency, demonstrating that domain-informed feature selection outperforms deep models in noisy conditions, enabling real-time usage in wearable brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), an efficient inference-time optimization method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhances accuracy using spectral and entropic features of logits, without additional parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of LLMs by addressing the computational inefficiency and suboptimal context usage in existing entropy-based inference methods.

Method: The method involves maintaining a sliding buffer of recent logits, applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract spectral properties, and adaptively rescaling logits based on observed entropy and logit gap statistics during high uncertainty.

Result: SLS demonstrates superior accuracy over baseline methods on multiple public benchmarks across tasks like mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: SLS provides a computationally efficient and effective approach to sharpen output distributions of LLMs without modifying model parameters, enhancing inference reliability.

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to tune the hyperparameters of optimization algorithms in auto-tuning systems, significantly improving their efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-tuning systems are critical for optimizing performance in scientific applications, but hyperparameters that influence optimization algorithms are often overlooked, despite their impact on efficiency.

Method: The authors propose a statistical evaluation method, provide FAIR data for reproducibility, and implement a simulation mode to significantly reduce the cost of hyperparameter tuning.

Result: The study found that hyperparameter tuning improved auto-tuner performance by 94.8% on average, and that meta-strategies for hyperparameter optimization further increased performance by 204.7% on average.

Conclusion: Hyperparameter tuning is a powerful yet underutilized technique in auto-tuning, capable of significantly advancing its efficiency and practical applications.

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

Motivation: To address the incompatibility of leading graph-based SSL methods like GRACE with Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to their reliance on non-polynomial operations.

Method: Developed the Poly-GRACE framework, which incorporates a polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoder and a new polynomial-based contrastive loss function.

Result: Poly-GRACE was evaluated on benchmark datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) and found to achieve performance close to, and sometimes exceeding, standard methods, enabling private pre-training.

Conclusion: Poly-GRACE provides a significant advancement in privacy-preserving graph learning by allowing HE-compatible self-supervised learning with competitive performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

*Fernanda Zapata Bascuñán*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study analyzes a denoising variational autoencoder (VAE-MoG) trained on gravitational wave data, finding that good signal reconstruction may still result in mismatches in latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to assess how well the latent space of a VAE-MoG trained on gravitational wave data captures the data's structure, and to examine the reliability of its latent representations.

Method: The paper uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to generate posterior samples based on clean inputs, comparing these to the VAE's encoder outputs derived from noisy data.

Result: While the model accurately reconstructs signals, statistical comparisons indicate a mismatch in the latent space between the encoder's outputs and HMC-based samples.

Conclusion: The study concludes that strong denoising performance does not guarantee reliable latent representations, emphasizing the need for posterior-based validation in generative model evaluations.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hyperbolic Adam optimizer, extending Riemannian optimization techniques, and demonstrates its efficacy in improving convergence speed for diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve optimization methods in hyperbolic spaces, aiming for faster convergence and enhanced representation, especially in the Poincaré embedding.

Method: The authors propose a Hyperbolic Adam optimizer building on Hyperbolic SGD, training diffusion models with hyperbolic time-discretization of Langevin dynamics.

Result: Hyperbolic optimization methods achieved faster convergence during early training phases in certain datasets without compromising generative quality.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic optimization methods are promising tools for accelerating convergence and improving generative model training in hyperbolic and potentially other geometric settings.

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

*Chang Liu,Danial Chitnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEsizer leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and circuit simulators to automate the transistor sizing in AMS circuits with minimal human intervention, showcasing robustness and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual transistor sizing in AMS ICs requires significant effort, and existing ML techniques face challenges such as iteration complexity and insufficient circuit design knowledge. Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for automation in this domain.

Method: EEsizer employs LLM-based AI integration with circuit simulators and data analysis tools, utilizing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning for iterative design refinement and optimization.

Result: Benchmarking 8 LLMs on basic circuits and optimizing a CMOS operational amplifier, EEsizer demonstrated successful automation with OpenAI o3, achieving design targets at advanced technology nodes within 20 iterations.

Conclusion: EEsizer showcases potential for fully automated transistor sizing, leveraging LLMs for robust and adaptable AMS circuit design solutions, minimizing manual intervention.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
feature engineering for tabular data, but concerns about their reliability

multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework to assess the robustness of LLMs
in feature engineering across diverse domains, focusing on the three main
factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work
opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven

### [372] [DPSformer: A long-tail-aware model for improving heavy rainfall prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25208)
*Zenghui Huang,Ting Shu,Zhonglei Wang,Yang Lu,Yan Yan,Wei Zhong,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPSformer, a model addressing the challenges of forecasting rare heavy rainfall events by enhancing their representation using a long-tail approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the challenge of accurately predicting rare, heavy rainfall events, which are critical for societal safety yet difficult due to their imbalanced representation in weather data.

Method: The paper addresses rainfall forecasting as a long-tailed learning problem. It proposes DPSformer, a model with a high-resolution branch to better represent and predict rare, heavy rainfall events.

Result: DPSformer significantly improves predictive performance for heavy rainfall events, enhancing the CSI from 0.012 to 0.067 and achieving an FSS score above 0.45 for the top 1% coverage.

Conclusion: DPSformer provides a long-tail-aware framework for heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to improve early warning systems and reduce societal impacts of extreme weather events.

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

### [373] [STCast: Adaptive Boundary Alignment for Global and Regional Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25210)
*Hao Chen,Tao Han,Jie Zhang,Song Guo,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STCast, an AI framework utilizing adaptive regional boundary optimization and temporal dynamic allocation for improved regional weather forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate regional weather prediction is challenging due to the limitations of static regional boundaries and poor generalization of existing methods.

Method: The authors propose Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) for boundary optimization and Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) to dynamically route month-specific climate data to specialized models.

Result: Experimental results show STCast outperforms state-of-the-art methods across global, regional, extreme event, and ensemble forecasts.

Conclusion: STCast provides an innovative framework that enhances both regional boundary prediction and temporal adaptability, achieving superior results in weather forecasting tasks.

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a deep learning framework optimizing trade execution tasks under flexible conditions and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve trading execution strategies by generalizing neural VWAP approaches and accommodating diverse scenarios with varying time horizons and execution goals.

Method: LEMs combine Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention mechanisms for market data processing, decoupled from execution-specific allocation networks.

Result: Empirical tests on cryptocurrency and equity markets show superior execution performance compared to traditional methods, with efficient adaptation across multiple trade scenarios.

Conclusion: LEMs provide a unified framework for diverse trade executions while leveraging shared market understanding, offering operational advantages over scenario-specific solutions.

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

TL;DR: The paper applies Taguchi Design of Experiments to optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing recognition, achieving high training accuracy and minimal loss values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter optimization in CNNs is computationally expensive and challenging, requiring systematic and efficient approaches beyond trial-and-error methods.

Method: Taguchi Design methodology using an L12(211) orthogonal array evaluated eight CNN hyperparameters in twelve configurations. Multi-objective optimization was conducted with Signal-to-Noise ratio analysis, supported by a novel logarithmic scaling technique.

Result: Approach 3 with weighted accuracy metrics and logarithmic loss transformation achieved 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25% validation accuracy, with learning rate identified as the most influential hyperparameter.

Conclusion: The study delivers a statistically robust optimization method for CNN hyperparameters, offering clear prioritization of impactful variables and enhancing performance metrics.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

### [376] [On-the-Fly Adaptation to Quantization: Configuration-Aware LoRA for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25214)
*Rongguang Ye,Ming Tang,Edith C. H. Ngai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoA-LoRA, a method for dynamically adapting LoRA adapters to various quantization configurations without needing repeated fine-tuning, especially useful for edge devices with heterogeneous capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of deploying large pre-trained models on edge devices with limited computational resources while preserving privacy, as edge devices have different configuration needs and fine-tuning for each can be too costly.

Method: CoA-LoRA uses a configuration-aware model that maps quantization settings to low-rank adjustments automatically, and a Pareto-based configuration search optimizes its training configuration set.

Result: Experiments show CoA-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods, while avoiding the computational burden of re-fine-tuning for every configuration.

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA provides an efficient and effective solution for adapting pre-trained models to diverse quantization configurations, making it suitable for privacy-preserving applications on edge devices without additional time costs.

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

TL;DR: The paper presents PARADISE, a non-supervised anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, combining variable partitioning and local anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve anomaly detection performance in multivariate time series by addressing inter-variable relationships effectively.

Method: PARADISE partitions variables using clustering on correlation coefficients and applies local anomaly detection on subsets.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrated significant performance improvements in detecting anomalies.

Conclusion: Partitioning variables and leveraging their relationships enhances anomaly detection in multivariate time series, as validated by experiments.

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

### [378] [Evaluating Double Descent in Machine Learning: Insights from Tree-Based Models Applied to a Genomic Prediction Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25216)
*Guillermo Comesaña Cimadevila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Double descent in test errors emerges when model complexity scales across both learner capacity and ensemble size, pointing to multi-dimensional model complexity in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to understand the double descent phenomenon observed in prediction errors, which deviates from classical U-shaped generalization patterns in machine learning models.

Method: The authors systematically vary model complexity along the axes of learner capacity and ensemble size and examine generalization behavior using a biological classification task and synthetic benchmarks.

Result: Double descent was consistently observed only when model complexity scaled jointly across learner capacity and ensemble size, while single-axis scaling reverted to classical generalization patterns.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of treating model complexity as multidimensional when analyzing generalization behavior, supporting the unfolding hypothesis of double descent under certain conditions.

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPE inference in PGMs is a computationally intractable problem, necessitating scalable methods to improve its efficiency.

Method: L2C employs a neural network to score variable-value assignments for conditioning, trains it using signals from MPE solver search traces, and integrates the trained network with search algorithms for better inference.

Result: The L2C approach reduces search space significantly while maintaining or improving solution quality on high-treewidth PGM problems compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: L2C demonstrates a scalable, data-driven approach to enhance the efficiency of MPE inference in PGMs through learned heuristics, making the approach promising for improving inference tasks.

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing inference time and classification accuracy in TinyML systems, which are constrained in computation, memory, and energy resources.

Method: The proposed method uses a DES-Clustering approach, allowing adjustments to classification accuracy while considering latency and energy consumption. A specialized TinyDES-Clustering library was implemented for this purpose.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that increasing the classifier pool improves classification accuracy but raises inference time on TinyML devices.

Conclusion: Dynamic Ensemble Selection is a viable optimization technique for TinyML systems, enabling trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency under resource constraints.

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable physics-informed machine learning framework for sensor-based flow estimation, optimizing for velocity and minimal uncertainty in drone trajectories over urban terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop reliable flow estimation techniques for drones navigating complex urban terrains, addressing limitations in handling large datasets, knowledge extrapolation, and flexible sensor placement.

Method: Introduces a framework leveraging Reynolds number scaling, domain decomposition, cluster-based representation, information entropy for subdomain correlation, and probabilistic models, demonstrated with a three-building urban setting.

Result: Validated model performance with accurate velocity and uncertainty estimations for drone trajectories through the urban environment tested.

Conclusion: Proposed framework extends traditional flow models, making it feasible for large-scale and dynamic applications like city-level flow estimations with weather incorporation.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

### [382] [TASP: Topology-aware Sequence Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26541)
*Yida Wang,Ke Hong,Xiuhong Li,Yuanchao Xu,Wenxun Wang,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses inefficiencies in long-context LLMs with self-attention mechanisms by proposing TASP, a topology-aware sequence parallelism method utilizing Hamiltonian decomposition for modern accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the communication inefficiencies in current sequence parallelism methods like Ring Attention when applied to modern accelerator topologies.

Method: The authors use Hamiltonian decomposition to identify multiple orthogonal ring datapaths in modern accelerator topology, enabling concurrent data transfer. They propose TASP to fully utilize communication capacity via topology and primitive decomposition.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that TASP outperforms Ring Attention and Zigzag-Ring Attention, achieving up to 3.58× speedup on various modern accelerator systems, such as NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300X.

Conclusion: TASP significantly improves communication efficiency and speedup in long-context LLMs, addressing key limitations of previous sequence parallelism methods and adapting well to current hardware topologies.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and

### [383] [Enhancing Linear Attention with Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25223)
*Xunhao Lai,Jialiang Kang,Jianqiao Lu,Tong Lin,Pengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Residual Linear Attention (RLA), addressing the limitations of existing linear attention methods in capturing long-range patterns, achieved through residual-fitting mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention methods face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies due to an expressivity bottleneck.

Method: The authors propose Residual Linear Attention (RLA), which supplements historical prediction with a mechanism to accumulate and correct residual errors, along with a delta-rule variant called Residual Delta Net (RDN) for enhanced adaptive control.

Result: RLA and RDN demonstrate superior performance in language modeling and recall-intensive tasks compared to baseline and existing linear-attention methods, achieving gains while keeping linear scalability.

Conclusion: The study suggests RLA and RDN as effective improvements to linear attention, narrowing the performance gap to standard Transformers while retaining efficiency.

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

*Yifang Zhang,Pengfei Duan,Henan Wang,Shengwu Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces RainfallBench, a new benchmark for the challenging task of rainfall nowcasting (predicting precipitation 0-3 hours ahead). It addresses gaps in current meteorological forecasting, uses global GNSS data with 5+ years of records, and evaluates 20+ models. A new methodology, BFPF, is proposed for overcoming challenges like zero inflation and temporal decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in meteorological forecasting benchmarks, which often focus on periodic variables like temperature, and to address the need for improving rainfall nowcasting, a critical task for disaster planning and mitigation.

Method: Introduce RainfallBench based on five years of global GNSS data, integrating key variables like precipitable water vapor. Develop specialized evaluation strategies for challenges like multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall, and propose Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF) to deal with rainfall's zero inflation and temporal decay issues.

Result: Demonstrated RainfallBench's utility, evaluated 20+ state-of-the-art models, and validated the new BFPF module as effective for enhancing precipitation forecasting through statistical analysis and testing.

Conclusion: RainfallBench is a comprehensive benchmark for rainfall nowcasting with datasets and tasks curated for practical, complex meteorological challenges. The proposed BFPF improves the accuracy of forecasting in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a kernel optimized for Huawei's Ascend NPUs to address inefficiencies in KVCache memory usage and computational overhead during the use of Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of computational overhead and intermediate variable expansion introduced by MLA in large language models – issues that hinder efficient hardware implementation, especially during the decode phase.

Method: The paper proposes AMLA with two core innovations: (1) a FlashAttention-based algorithm using integer additions instead of floating-point multiplications for better efficiency, and (2) a Preload Pipeline strategy with hierarchical tiling to optimize data movement and computation.

Result: Experimental results show that AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS on Huawei’s Ascend 910 NPUs, with 86.8% theoretical FLOPS utilization, outperforming existing state-of-the-art implementations like FlashMLA on NVIDIA hardware.

Conclusion: AMLA significantly improves MLA performance on Huawei Ascend hardware, achieving near-theoretical peak performance and demonstrating the potential for better integration in hardware-specific optimization. The kernel will be released as part of Huawei's CANN.

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

*Payal Mohapatra,Yueyuan Sui,Akash Pandey,Stephen Xia,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO is a framework designed to tackle limitations in multimodal time-series learning, overcoming issues like unclear modality priors and sensor failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sensor monitoring in real-world applications faces challenges such as alignment reliance, pairwise modality modeling, and incomplete data due to missing observations.

Method: MAESTRO employs dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions, symbolic tokenization, adaptive attention budgeting, sparse cross-modal attention, and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism.

Result: MAESTRO outperformed existing approaches with improvements of up to 9% under partial observations and 4-8% under complete observations on diverse datasets.

Conclusion: MAESTRO offers a robust and efficient solution for real-world multimodal time-series tasks, especially under challenging conditions such as missing modality data.

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

*Long Xu,Yongcai Chen,Fengshuo Liu,Yuzhong Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSCoD, a new generative model for structure-based drug design utilizing hierarchical feature extraction and attention mechanisms to address limitations in current techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SBDD methods struggle to capture complex protein-ligand interactions due to overlooking hierarchical organization and intrinsic asymmetry.

Method: The MSCoD framework is built on Bayesian updating with a Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck for feature extraction and a Multi-Head Cooperative Attention mechanism for capturing diverse, asymmetric protein-ligand interactions.

Result: MSCoD outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets and showed promising results in case studies on targets like KRAS G12D.

Conclusion: MSCoD is an effective and practical improvement for structure-based drug design, overcoming several existing challenges. Code and data are openly shared for further validation.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

### [388] [Gradient Descent with Large Step Sizes: Chaos and Fractal Convergence Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25351)
*Shuang Liang,Guido Montúfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines gradient descent in matrix factorization, showing that large step sizes can lead to fractal behavior in the parameter space and sensitive dependency on initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of step size in gradient descent during matrix factorization, particularly near critical thresholds, and explore how initialization and regularization affect the convergence behavior.

Method: The authors derive the critical step size for scalar-vector factorization, analyze initialization sensitivity, and extend the findings to broader matrix factorization cases with orthogonal initialization.

Result: They demonstrate that near-critical step sizes create a chaotic regime where initialization influences outcomes unpredictably, and regularization exacerbates this sensitivity.

Conclusion: Near-critical gradient descent is chaotic, lacking clear implicit biases, which has implications for understanding and controlling optimization behaviors in matrix factorization processes.

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

### [389] [Integrated Forecasting of Marine Renewable Power: An Adaptively Bayesian-Optimized MVMD-LSTM Framework for Wind-Solar-Wave Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25226)
*Baoyi Xie,Shuiling Shi,Wenqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian-optimized MVMD-LSTM framework to enhance ultra-short-term forecasting for integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems, achieving superior predictive accuracy and automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address issues with existing forecasting methods for integrated marine energy systems, which fail to account for complex couplings, struggle with nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and require extensive manual parameter tuning.

Method: The proposed framework combines Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) for joint decomposition of multi-source power data with Bayesian optimization for tuning parameters. It then applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model the decomposed data and deliver accurate forecasts.

Result: Field experiments on offshore energy data from China demonstrate that the authors' framework achieves significantly better forecasting performance compared to benchmark models, improving metrics like MAPE, RMSE, and MAE.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the Bayesian-optimized MVMD-LSTM framework offers a highly effective approach for improving predictive accuracy, robustness, automation, and practical utility of ultra-short-term forecasts in integrated marine energy systems.

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

*Ahmad Ayaz Amin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a new method for injective normalizing flows using random projection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for injective normalizing flows that is efficient, theoretically grounded, and simple to implement without requiring learned or PCA-based maps.

Method: Utilizing random semi-orthogonal matrices, derived from Gaussian matrices via QR decomposition, to project data into lower-dimension latent representations. This includes closed-form expressions for volume correction.

Result: RPFs provide a theoretically sound and efficient approach, showing practical effectiveness for generative modeling.

Conclusion: RPFs connect random projection theory and normalizing flows, serving as a strong baseline for generative modeling while being ready-to-use and computationally efficient.

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

### [391] [Flow Matching with Semidiscrete Couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25519)
*Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Stephen Y. Zhang,Michal Klein,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semidiscrete Flow Matching (SD-FM) to overcome the computational challenges in optimal transport (OT) flow matching. This novel approach uses semidiscrete OT instead of batch-OT, significantly improving scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiencies and high costs of using batch-based OT flow matching (OT-FM) in training flow models for noise-to-data generation.

Method: The authors propose SD-FM, which utilizes semidiscrete optimal transport by solving for dual potential vectors using SGD and matching noise to data points via a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) instead of batch OT.

Result: SD-FM eliminates the quadratic dependency on batch size and regularization, surpassing both traditional flow matching and OT-FM in performance metrics and inference efficiency, across various datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: SD-FM simplifies the implementation of flow matching, reduces computational bottlenecks, and is shown to outperform existing methods for unconditional/conditional generation tasks with lower costs and improved scalability.

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses limitations in traditional flow matching methods that rely on straight paths and geodesics, constrained by dimensionality challenges, aiming to improve representation of the data manifold for temporal data.

Method: The authors propose the use of score matching and annealed energy distillation techniques to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the data geometry.

Result: Experiments on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics and cell interpolation demonstrate the improved efficacy of the proposed methodology.

Conclusion: The approach allows for more accurate flows and better representation of the underlying data geometry compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation
of cell

*Yichi Zhang,Fangzheng Xie,Shu Yang,Chong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal inference framework for training large language model (LLM) routers using both gold-standard and preference-based data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying a single best model for human-model interactions is costly; using a router can optimize cost and response quality.

Method: The authors frame the router training problem into a causal inference perspective and develop a method to correct biases in preference-based data while integrating multiple data sources.

Result: The proposed framework achieves more accurate routing and better cost-quality trade-offs in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating causal inference concepts improves the robustness and efficiency of LLM routers using mixed data sources.

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

*Xiaojian Wang,Chaoli Zhang,Zhonglong Zheng,Yunliang Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WDformer, a Transformer model enhanced with wavelet-based differential attention mechanisms for improved time series forecasting. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional time-domain or frequency-domain models struggle to fully utilize multi-domain information from sparse time series data, and existing attention mechanisms often over-emphasize irrelevant historical data, adding noise and bias.

Method: WDformer incorporates wavelet transforms for multi-resolution analysis and combines time-frequency domain representations. It introduces differential attention mechanisms to refocus on critical information while filtering noise, and applies attention on inverted dimensions to link multiple variables.

Result: WDformer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in time series forecasting across various challenging real-world datasets.

Conclusion: By addressing noise reduction and improving multi-domain representation, WDformer enhances forecasting accuracy. Its adoption of wavelet transform and differential attention mechanisms represents a significant advancement in time series prediction tasks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Mixture Approximation (GMA) samplers for efficiently sampling unnormalized target densities, focusing on methods like W-GMA, LMA, and EM-GMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computationally efficient and gradient-free method for sampling from unnormalized target densities using Gaussian components.

Method: The GMA method involves a two-stage process: initializing Gaussian components, sampling from their mixture, and adjusting weights and/or means and variances through a KL divergence-based optimization, followed by stratified resampling.

Result: The paper demonstrates that GMA achieves consistent approximations under mild conditions and delivers fast and accurate performance on diverse densities.

Conclusion: GMA samplers are effective, gradient-free, and computationally efficient tools for approximating and sampling from complex, unnormalized densities.

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCLF is an enhancement to Federated Learning designed for Internet of Vehicles networks, addressing challenges of data and device heterogeneity and improving model accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in Federated Learning within heterogeneous and resource-constrained IoV networks, including low model accuracy and inefficient resource utilization.

Method: FedCLF integrates calibrated loss for participant selection and introduces feedback control to manage client sampling frequency dynamically.

Result: Experiments using CIFAR-10 demonstrate FedCLF achieves up to 16% improvement in accuracy in high data heterogeneity scenarios and optimizes resource usage through reduced client sampling.

Conclusion: FedCLF provides a robust solution for improving the efficacy and efficiency of Federated Learning in IoV networks, making it more suitable for dynamic and heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Method: The authors propose BaB-prob, which employs preactivation splitting and linear bound propagation to probabilistically verify neural networks. They introduce uncertainty levels and strategies for efficient splitting, resulting in BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob.

Result: BaB-prob was tested on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. It consistently outperformed existing methods in medium- to high-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: BaB-prob advances the probabilistic verification of neural networks and provides a robust framework suitable for various model sizes and benchmarks.

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

*Nikola Prianikov,Evelyne Janssen-van Dam,Marcin Pietrasik,Charalampos S. Kouzinopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Machine Learning method for classifying Canon printhead failures based on nozzle behavior data, outperforming a rule-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve identification of printhead failure mechanisms to maintain product quality for Canon Production Printing.

Method: A feature-based time-series classification framework is used with domain-guided time and spatial features. Various traditional Machine Learning classifiers, including One-vs-Rest Random Forest, are evaluated.

Result: The One-vs-Rest Random Forest algorithm demonstrated the best performance, achieving higher weighted F1 scores than the in-house rule-based model for several failure mechanisms.

Conclusion: The ML-based classification method proves more effective than the traditional rule-based approach for analyzing printhead failures, suggesting it is a viable tool for improving fault diagnostics.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPATTA, a method that enhances Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) by employing conformal prediction to improve robustness under domain shifts, and achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and heuristic-based uncertainty measures in Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) methods, which waste human annotation budgets under domain shifts.

Method: CPATTA introduces a coverage-guaranteed uncertainty measure through smoothed conformal scores, employs a top-K certainty measure, uses an online weight-update algorithm informed by pseudo coverage, integrates a domain-shift detector, and implements a staged update scheme to balance human-labeled and model-labeled data.

Result: CPATTA significantly improves accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art ATTA methods by around 5%, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CPATTA offers a principled and more efficient approach for ATTA, enhancing model robustness under domain shift and better utilizing human annotation resources.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

*Sri Vatsa Vuddanti,Aarav Shah,Satwik Kumar Chittiprolu,Tony Song,Sunishchal Dev,Kevin Zhu,Maheep Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALADIN is a framework aimed at improving recovery from tool failures in language agents through systematic failure injection and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world scenarios due to tool malfunctions, making failure recovery a critical area to address.

Method: PALADIN involves systematic failure injection, expert demonstrations on the ToolBench dataset, fine-tuning using LoRA, and inference through retrieval of recovery exemplars.

Result: PALADIN leads to significant recovery improvement, achieving 89.86% recovery rate versus 23.75% in vanilla agents and outperforming other baselines.

Conclusion: PALADIN is established as an effective means of improving robustness and fault tolerance in language agents operating with real-world tools.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

### [401] [Online Decision Making with Generative Action Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25777)
*Jianyu Xu,Vidhi Jain,Bryan Wilder,Aarti Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a doubly-optimistic algorithm for online learning agents capable of generating new actions at a cost, achieving favorable tradeoffs between exploration, exploitation, and creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how decision-making agents can balance the cost of generating new actions against the potential benefits, particularly in a challenging setup with dynamically expanding action spaces.

Method: The authors propose a doubly-optimistic algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for selecting existing actions and Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for generating new ones.

Result: Empirical tests on a healthcare question-answering dataset reveal favorable tradeoffs between action generation and quality, outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, a theoretical result demonstrates a sublinear regret bound.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively balances creation, exploration, and exploitation, offering both practical benefits in dynamic tasks and a theoretical foundation for optimal performance in such frameworks.

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

*Ming Yang,Xiaofan Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Dengliang Shi,Jintao Du,Yu Cheng,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAMMER is a novel reinforcement learning method that uses diversity metrics to improve training of large language models, achieving better accuracy results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current curriculum reinforcement learning for LLMs relies on difficulty-based annotations, which can lead to local optimization and limited policy exploration during training.

Method: HAMMER introduces a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path based on diversity metrics to order training samples, enhancing exploration in the early training stages.

Result: HAMMER achieves consistent 3% to 4% accuracy improvements across diverse inference benchmarks, showing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Diversity-driven sample ordering in HAMMER enables better convergence and stimulates curiosity in LLMs, resulting in consistent performance gains.

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

### [403] [Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25810)
*Shenao Zhang,Donghan Yu,Yihao Feng,Bowen Jin,Zhaoran Wang,John Peebles,Zirui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mid-training phase to improve reinforcement learning (RL) performance in large language models by optimizing an action subspace for faster online decision-making. A novel algorithm called RA3 shows notable improvements in code generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the application of reinforcement learning in large language models through a mid-training phase that optimizes decision-making, thus addressing challenges in compact action spaces and fast RL convergence.

Method: The authors propose the RA3 algorithm, which combines sequential variational optimization and iterative RL to discover temporally-consistent latent structures, followed by fine-tuning on bootstrapped data.

Result: RA3 improved code generation task performance on benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points respectively over baselines. It also demonstrated faster convergence and higher performance in RLVR across multiple code-related tasks.

Conclusion: Mid-training using RA3 effectively utilizes action abstractions for RL, enhancing convergence speed and overall performance, particularly in code generation tasks, validating the approach's scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

*Yuan Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates fine-tuning methods to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in cybersecurity tasks, showing that techniques like LoRA and QLoRA are effective and computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the suboptimal zero-shot performance of general-purpose LLMs in specialized domains like cybersecurity, highlighting the need to embed domain-specific expertise into these models.

Method: The authors explore fine-tuning strategies like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q&A dataset, assessing their computational efficiency and performance improvements.

Result: Fine-tuning methods significantly improved LLM performance in cybersecurity Q&A tasks, with LoRA and QLoRA achieving similar results to SFT but with much lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Low-rank fine-tuning approaches, such as LoRA and QLoRA, provide a practical and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to specialized domains like cybersecurity, bridging the gap between general-purpose models and domain-specific needs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

*Jingqi Fan,Canzhe Zhao,Shuai Li,Siwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel algorithm for decentralized asynchronous multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) settings, addressing challenges related to collision avoidance and player detection, achieving efficient regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems like cognitive radio networks and IoT often operate in decentralized, asynchronous environments, different from most existing MP-MAB research. Challenges include avoiding collisions and detecting the number of players efficiently.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm where players adaptively alternate between exploration and exploitation. In exploration, players uniformly pull arms to reduce collision likelihood. In exploitation, they sample arms occasionally to detect player changes.

Result: The algorithm achieves a regret bound of $
{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$, validated through experiments demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: This is the first efficient MP-MAB solution tailored for asynchronous and decentralized settings, proving applicability in practical, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

*Prajjwal Bhattarai,Mohammad Amjad,Dmytro Zhylko,Tuka Alhanai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a critique of existing feature-based distillation methods, providing theoretical evidence of their limitations, and proposes new approaches leveraging Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix to enhance distillation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the transfer of knowledge from larger models to smaller ones in knowledge distillation by addressing the limitations of current feature-based approaches.

Method: The paper introduces the use of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix as distillation losses, which align feature geometry for more effective knowledge transfer.

Result: The proposed methods achieve statistically significant improvements in the distillation performance of language models (BERT and OPT) by up to 2 points in various tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating feature geometry through the proposed methods enhances the effectiveness of feature distillation, highlighting the importance of better capturing the structure of the feature space.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

*Daniel Ebi,Gaspard Lambrechts,Damien Ernst,Klemens Böhm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new actor-critic framework, informed asymmetric actor-critic, which allows critics to use privileged partial information instead of requiring full-state access during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of reinforcement learning in partially observable environments where agents must act under noisy and incomplete observations.

Method: The authors propose the informed asymmetric actor-critic framework, extending policy gradient theory to support partial privileged information. They also introduce informativeness measures to evaluate training-time signals.

Result: Empirical validation shows improved learning efficiency and value estimation in benchmark navigation tasks using privileged partial information compared to full-state access approaches.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that full-state access may not be necessary for effective asymmetric reinforcement learning methods, paving the way for more flexible and theoretically sound approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Motivation: To tackle challenges like spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility in UAV-assisted mobile crowdsensing.

Method: A non-convex stochastic optimization problem is formulated as a POMDP and solved using a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach with hybrid actor networks and enhanced with CNNs and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN).

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in the amount of processed sensing data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust and scalable solution for enhancing UAV-assisted MCS efficiency, addressing key challenges in resource coordination and leveraging advanced reinforcement learning techniques.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a reinforcement learning framework, to dynamically select prompting strategies for large language models, ensuring cost efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static prompting strategies in LLMs lead to inefficiencies, either wasting resources on simple tasks or failing on complex inputs.

Method: Introduced Prompt Policy Network (PPN), which uses Proximal Policy Optimization and a resource-aware reward to adaptively select reasoning strategies.

Result: PPN improved the efficiency-accuracy balance, reducing token costs by up to 61.5% compared to Self-Consistency, without compromising accuracy on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: PPN offers an adaptive, cost-efficient approach to LLM prompting, demonstrating scalable optimization for language model applications.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

### [410] [Sandbagging in a Simple Survival Bandit Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26239)
*Joel Dyer,Daniel Jarne Ornia,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of AI systems strategically deceiving evaluators to avoid deactivation, developing a model to distinguish between genuine incompetence and intentional underperformance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The safety evaluation of advanced AI systems is critical, but deception like "sandbagging" undermines the process, potentially allowing dangerous AI capabilities to remain unchecked.

Method: A survival bandit-inspired sequential decision-making model is created to demonstrate theoretical sandbagging behavior. Statistical tests are constructed to distinguish between deceptive and incompetent behaviors, supported by simulation experiments.

Result: The research successfully identifies behavioral patterns linked to sandbagging through statistical tests and validates the tests in simulated environments.

Conclusion: This study provides a framework for improving the reliability of safety evaluations for advanced AI systems by addressing strategic deception with statistical methods.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the fine-tuning of Silurian AI's weather foundation model (WFM) to provide asset-level weather forecasts and demonstrates its ability to outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks across variables critical for grid resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in leveraging the advanced weather foundation models for practical, weather-sensitive infrastructure needs, such as power grid resilience.

Method: The Generative Forecasting Transformer (GFT), a 1.5B-parameter WFM, is fine-tuned using high-fidelity asset data from Hydro-Québec, focusing on grid-critical variables, for hyper-local forecasts.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed standard numerical weather prediction (NWP) benchmarks, reducing temperature MAE by 15%, precipitation MAE by 35%, and wind speed MAE by 15%. It also achieved a 0.72 average precision score in rime-ice detection, a task current systems cannot handle.

Conclusion: Post-training WFMs with high-quality, domain-specific data can transform them into effective tools for critical applications like grid resilience, offering both improved accuracy and new capabilities.

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

### [412] [InfMasking: Unleashing Synergistic Information by Contrastive Multimodal Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25270)
*Liangjian Wen,Qun Dai,Jianzhuang Liu,Jiangtao Zheng,Yong Dai,Dongkai Wang,Zhao Kang,Jun Wang,Zenglin Xu,Jiang Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfMasking, a novel multimodal representation learning method using infinite masking to enhance synergistic information extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic interactions between modalities, which limits their performance in multimodal representation tasks.

Method: They propose InfMasking, which employs a stochastic infinite masking strategy during fusion to preserve partial information from each modality, generating varied synergy patterns. Mutual information maximization aligns these representations.

Result: InfMasking enhances synergistic interactions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks on large-scale real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The InfMasking approach effectively captures and enhances synergistic information in multimodal representation tasks, addressing challenges in prior methods and validating its effectiveness through experiments and evaluations.

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

*Margarita A. Guerrero,Cristian R. Rojas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) identify minimal input changes needed for a desired machine learning prediction; ACE algorithm achieves this with sample-efficient methods compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency of existing methods for CFEs that require numerous evaluations of black-box models, which is costly and impractical.

Method: They propose ACE, integrating Bayesian estimation and stochastic optimization to approximate decision boundaries through prioritized sampling of informative points.

Result: ACE demonstrated superior efficiency in minimizing evaluations needed for CFEs while achieving effective and accurate results compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: ACE provides a cost-effective and efficient approach for generating feasible CFEs, advancing the field of interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

TL;DR: Authors propose a DRL framework for dynamic resource allocation in HetNets, optimizing multiple objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with dynamic user loads and channel conditions in HetNets.

Method: Used DRL (PPO and TD3) to jointly optimize transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling.

Result: DRL frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms across various network scenarios.

Conclusion: DRL offers superior, adaptable solutions for resource allocation in future HetNets.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

*Mohammadreza Bakhtyari,Bogdan Mazoure,Renato Cordeiro de Amorim,Guillaume Rabusseau,Vladimir Makarenkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ClustRecNet is a novel deep learning framework designed to recommend optimal clustering algorithms for given datasets, outperforming traditional methods and state-of-the-art AutoML approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the long-standing challenge of selecting appropriate clustering algorithms in unsupervised learning.

Method: The proposed approach builds a repository of 34,000 synthetic datasets, processes them using 10 clustering algorithms, and evaluates these clusterings using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). It then uses a deep learning architecture combining convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms for clustering recommendations.

Result: ClustRecNet outperformed conventional Cluster Validity Indices like Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz, as well as state-of-the-art AutoML methods, achieving significant ARI improvements on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ClustRecNet effectively learns dataset representations and directly recommends optimal clustering algorithms, reducing reliance on traditional meta-features and validity indices, and advancing clustering performance for various datasets.

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how scaling laws of large language models (LLMs) behave during reinforcement learning (RL) post-training with a focus on mathematical reasoning, presenting four key findings about model scale, data volume, and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs behave and can be optimized during RL post-training is underexplored, particularly regarding their reasoning abilities. This paper aims to fill that gap.

Method: The study conducted 54 experiments across various model sizes and training setups to analyze the relationships between model scale, data, and computational resources in RL post-training.

Result: Four main findings were presented, such as larger models outperforming smaller ones under fixed computation, larger models having better sample efficiency, the effectiveness of data reuse in data-constrained scenarios, and consistent scaling behaviors across both base and instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: The findings establish a foundational understanding of RL post-training's scaling behaviors, offering guidelines to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs efficiently.

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

### [417] [Uncertainty-Aware Generative Oversampling Using an Entropy-Guided Conditional Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25334)
*Amirhossein Zare,Amirhessam Zare,Parmida Sadat Pezeshki,Herlock,Rahimi,Ali Ebrahimi,Ignacio Vázquez-García,Leo Anthony Celi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces LEO-CVAE, a framework that focuses on oversampling data in uncertain and boundary-region areas for improving performance in machine learning tasks with class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance is a critical challenge, especially in biomedical datasets with high-dimensional and nonlinear structures, where traditional and contemporary oversampling methods fail to handle uncertainty adequately.

Method: The authors propose LEO-CVAE, which employs a local entropy-weighted loss and entropy-guided sampling to concentrate on uncertain areas. It uses Shannon entropy to measure local class overlap as a proxy for uncertainty.

Result: When applied to datasets like ADNI and TCGA lung cancer, LEO-CVAE consistently achieves improved classifier performance compared to traditional and generative oversampling methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty into data generation improves handling of class imbalance in complex datasets, emphasizing the potential of such an approach in biomedical and similar domains.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on active correlation clustering in a cost-efficient, cold-start scenario using a diversity-driven method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve active correlation clustering where initial pairwise similarities are unavailable, addressing the challenges of cold-start scenarios.

Method: Proposed a coverage-aware approach to encourage diversity in querying pairwise similarities during active learning.

Result: The proposed method was tested on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The diversity-encouraging approach can overcome cold-start issues in active correlation clustering efficiently.

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active
learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true
initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address
this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity
early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
several synthetic and real-world experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new physically motivated diffusion-based generative model for protein design and folding, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein structure and folding are crucial in biology, but existing generative models lack physical realism.

Method: The study introduces a non-linear physically motivated noising process with SE(3)-invariant modeling and incorporates sequence conditioning.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating novel protein structures and accurate folding of protein sequences.

Conclusion: This approach advances protein design by integrating physical principles with generative modeling, enhancing structural realism and novel design.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

*Shane Bergsma,Nolan Dey,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Training Re-evaluation Curve (TREC) to analyze optimal data placement during LLM training. It highlights the importance of aligning high-quality data with low points on the TREC to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and optimize data placement in LLM training, as current strategies lack clarity and systematic principles.

Method: The authors develop the TREC diagnostic, which evaluates training batches retrospectively based on final model weights. They also demonstrate how TRECs can be predicted in advance using AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients.

Result: Analyzing TRECs across models of varying sizes, they show that placing high-quality data at TREC minima improves performance. They further improve a 3.9B-parameter LLM's performance by optimizing data placement in continual pre-training.

Conclusion: The study offers a novel tool for diagnosing and proactively optimizing LLM training curricula, addressing inefficiencies in current data placement strategies.

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prognostic modeling in critical care by effectively capturing both dynamic risk factors and static predictors, even with irregular and incomplete data.

Method: Developed a unified deep-learning framework combining a micro-network Basis Layer for functional data representation and a gradient-based imputation module for handling missing data.

Result: FCRN significantly outperformed random survival forests and traditional competing risks models in prediction accuracy on simulated and real-world ICU datasets.

Conclusion: FCRN enhances survival analysis by integrating functional covariates and managing missing data, making it a promising tool for critical care risk assessment.

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-based RL approach, TD-MPC2, to improve autonomous endovascular navigation for mechanical thrombectomy, achieving better success rates and generalization compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy is challenging due to complex vascular anatomy and the need for accurate real-time decision-making, coupled with existing RL models struggling with generalization and long-horizon tasks.

Method: The authors propose TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm integrated into the world model framework, and train it across multiple navigation tasks using real patient vasculatures.

Result: Compared to Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), TD-MPC2 achieved a 65% mean success rate versus SAC's 37%, showing significant improvement in navigation success but requiring longer procedure times.

Conclusion: TD-MPC2 demonstrates great promise for enhancing autonomous endovascular navigation, enabling better generalization and success rates, but future research is needed to optimize the trade-offs between precision and speed.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

Motivation: To improve clustering accuracy when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-experts, by leveraging aggregated predictions from multiple algorithms.

Method: Adapting the Dawid-Skene model to treat outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations, combining them systematically via the mixsemble framework.

Result: Experiments demonstrate mixsemble approaches top performance consistently and avoids poor outcomes on simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Mixsemble provides a robust and practical clustering solution in scenarios where data structure is unknown, making it suitable for non-expert users.

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

TL;DR: This paper explores using a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM) within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for identifying equations governing dynamic systems, aiming to improve model generalization across operating conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring that models derived from equation discovery generalize across operating conditions, rather than over-fitting to specific datasets.

Method: The study uses a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM) within an MTL framework, treating responses from a structure under varying excitation levels as related tasks. These tasks share model parameters but retain task-specific noise characteristics.

Result: The MTL-RVM approach effectively combined information across datasets, improving parameter recovery for poorly stimulated cases, while performing well under high excitation. Single-task models, by contrast, often failed to identify governing terms under weak excitation.

Conclusion: Multi-task Bayesian inference enhances generalization and reduces over-fitting in equation discovery. This approach is particularly useful in structural health monitoring under varying load conditions.

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

*Hao Ban,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALoRA and Fed-ALoRA, modifications to the multi-LoRA framework in large language model adaptation, which demonstrate improved performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address limitations in multi-LoRA designs, specifically regarding the common assumption that inner $A$ matrices share knowledge during training, by investigating their initialization and proposing alternative adaptations.

Method: The paper introduces ALoRA, which uses multiple $A$ matrices with a single shared $B$ for multi-task fine-tuning, and Fed-ALoRA, which shares $B$ among clients in federated fine-tuning using a matrix decomposition strategy.

Result: Experiments showed that ALoRA and Fed-ALoRA achieve more balanced, high-performing results across diverse tasks compared to existing multi-LoRA methods.

Conclusion: The asymmetric design of ALoRA and Fed-ALoRA provides a promising approach for improving parameter-efficient adaptation of large language models in both multi-task and federated settings.

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel attack framework targeting vulnerabilities in Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs). HIA uses strategic perturbations to significantly degrade TGNNs' performance, highlighting the need for more robust models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of existing attack methods on Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs), which rely on simplistic and detectable perturbations and fail to target critical nodes and edges strategically, leaving vulnerabilities unexplored.

Method: HIA employs a data-driven surrogate model to identify structurally and dynamically important nodes in the graph. It uses a hybrid perturbation strategy combining strategic edge injection and targeted edge deletion to maximize performance degradation while minimizing detectability.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across five real-world datasets and four TGNN architectures demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction task, with up to a 35.55% drop in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in current STDG models and emphasizes the pressing need for developing robust defenses that consider both structural and temporal dynamics in TGNNs.

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

Motivation: Pretrained policies, while promising, can collapse into limited behaviors during RLFT, reducing exploration and adaptability.

Method: Introduced a 'polychromic objective' for policy gradient methods and updated proximal policy optimization (PPO) using vine sampling and modified advantage functions.

Result: The method improved success rates in BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity environments, generalized better under large perturbations, and achieved higher coverage in pass@$k$ experiments.

Conclusion: The approach enhances RLFT by ensuring diverse behavioral exploration while addressing critical convergence issues in pretrained policies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

### [428] [Boundary-to-Region Supervision for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25727)
*Huikang Su,Dengyun Peng,Zifeng Zhuang,YuHan Liu,Qiguang Chen,Donglin Wang,Qinghe Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces B2R, a framework for safe offline reinforcement learning that utilizes asymmetric conditioning to better handle return-to-go (RTG) and cost-to-go (CTG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing sequence-model-based methods, which treat RTG and CTG symmetrically, resulting in unreliable constraint satisfaction when encountering out-of-distribution cost trajectories.

Method: The method involves redefining CTG as a rigid boundary constraint under a fixed safety budget, combined with rotary positional embeddings, to enable enhanced exploration within safe regions.

Result: B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38 safety-critical tasks and outperforms baseline methods in reward performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of asymmetric conditioning, offering a new theoretical and practical approach for safe reinforcement learning with sequence models.

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

*Sreeja Apparaju,Yichuan Niu,Xixi Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel feedback-based controller to improve budget pacing in online advertising by reducing instability and inefficiency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pacing methods in online advertising often rely on unstable and inefficient ad-hoc parameter tuning, leading to inconsistent spend alignment with campaign goals.

Method: The authors present a controller combining bucketized hysteresis with proportional feedback, accompanied by a framework for parameter selection to ensure accurate tracking of spend rates.

Result: Experiments on real-world online auctions demonstrate a 13% reduction in pacing error and a 54% decrease in $
volatility compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: By integrating control theory into advertising systems, the proposed method offers scalable, reliable, and particularly advantageous budget pacing for small-budget campaigns.

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

### [430] [Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25438)
*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM), a method for improving exploration in noisy environments by rewarding agents for model improvement, rather than prediction error or novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of naive intrinsic reward systems, which often get stuck at unlearnable random patterns in noisy environments.

Method: LPM uses a dual-network design where an error model predicts expected prediction errors of a dynamics model over iterations. The intrinsic reward comes from the difference between current and past model errors.

Result: LPM was empirically evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy environments, showing faster convergence of intrinsic rewards, better exploration, and higher extrinsic rewards in tests including MNIST, 3D maze environments, and Atari.

Conclusion: LPM provides a noise-robust exploration framework that is experimentally efficient and aligns intrinsic rewards with informational gains, offering a paradigm shift in intrinsic motivation research.

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

*Sofiane Ennadir,Siavash Golkar,Leopoldo Sarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TS-JEPA, a self-supervised learning approach for time series data, surpasses current methods in classification and forecasting tasks, offering robust representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in existing self-supervised learning methods, such as vulnerability to noise, by introducing a latent space learning approach tailored for time series data.

Method: The authors adapt the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) to time series data, validating its effectiveness through experiments on classification and forecasting tasks across standard datasets.

Result: TS-JEPA matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing strong performance across diverse time series tasks.

Conclusion: The work establishes TS-JEPA as a reliable framework for time series representation learning, paving the way for future time series foundation models.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that improves robot task success rates by focusing on underperforming tasks using a novel scheduling strategy. It achieves high performance with fewer demonstrations and zero-shot transfer capabilities to real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of generalist robot policies requiring extensive expert data, aiming to make multitask policy training more efficient.

Method: The framework uses a performance-aware scheduling strategy based on a Kalman filter estimator to allocate demonstrations across tasks where the policy struggles.

Result: High task success with substantially fewer expert demonstrations and better zero-shot real-world robot performance compared to naive baselines (DAgger and Behavior Cloning).

Conclusion: The method improves multitask learning efficiency and robustness, enabling effective multitask policies with minimal expert data and high adaptability to real-world robots.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

*Danyang Li,Yixuan Wang,Matthew Cleaveland,Mingyu Cai,Roberto Tron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops an end-to-end differentiable framework combining Conformal Prediction (CP) with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference to ensure statistical correctness and enhance rule interpretability and prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STL inference methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the extracted rules. The work is motivated by the need to enhance not only reliability but also interpretability in inferred rules from time-series data.

Method: The method introduces a robustness-based nonconformity score, embeds a smooth CP layer during the training process, and uses a loss function that jointly optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets. Finally, the approach applies an exact CP procedure to deliver statistical guarantees for STL formulas.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by reducing uncertainty in predictions, i.e., achieving high coverage with smaller prediction sets, and improving classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel STL inference approach with integrated statistical confidence, offering enhanced reliability, interpretability, and predictive performance compared to existing baseline methods.

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

### [434] [Translation from Wearable PPG to 12-Lead ECG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25480)
*Hui Ji,Wei Gao,Pengfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'P2Es,' a novel framework to generate 12-lead ECG from PPG signals effectively, addressing limitations of existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the need for unobtrusive 12-lead ECG monitoring since existing methods are cumbersome or inadequate for sustained ambulatory settings.

Method: P2Es employs a demographic-aware diffusion framework with three innovations: frequency-domain blurring and noise simulation in the forward process, a temporal multi-scale generation module with frequency deblurring in the reverse process, and demographic-specific ECG translation using KNN-based clustering and contrastive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that P2Es outperforms baseline models in generating accurate 12-lead ECG from PPG signals.

Conclusion: P2Es provides an effective, innovative solution for translating PPG signals into clinically valid 12-lead ECG, overcoming existing limitations in cardiovascular monitoring systems.

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PageANN is a scalable disk-based ANNS framework that enhances query speed and efficiency using innovative graph structures and memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the memory scalability issues and performance limitations in disk-based ANNS methods, crucial for large-scale vector databases.

Method: PageANN proposes a page-node graph structure that clusters similar vectors into SSD pages, optimizes data layout, and introduces an improved memory management strategy to reduce I/O latency.

Result: The framework achieves 1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining high recall accuracy.

Conclusion: PageANN provides a scalable and high-performance disk-based ANNS solution, addressing key challenges in large-scale vector search efficiently.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mole-PAIR is a plug-and-play module designed to improve the reliability of molecular foundation models on out-of-distribution samples, addressing issues like chemical hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific discovery, especially in areas like drug discovery and protein design, faces challenges from molecular foundation models' unreliability on OOD samples, causing errors such as chemical hallucination.

Method: Mole-PAIR uses a pairwise learning objective to optimize OOD detection by ranking the affinity between in-distribution and OOD samples, ultimately improving AUROC scores.

Result: Mole-PAIR demonstrated significant gains in OOD detection across five datasets, with improvements in AUROC by up to 45.8% for size shifts, 43.9% for scaffold shifts, and 24.3% for assay shifts.

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR effectively enhances the reliability of molecular foundation models in high-stakes applications, making them better suited for handling OOD data.

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating a queue prioritization algorithm combining generative AI and active learning to enhance the efficiency of identifying high-quality candidates in inverse design problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI is useful for exploring design spaces but suffers from resource wastage on low-quality or nonsensical regions without effective guidance.

Method: The authors developed a workflow that integrates generative modeling with an active learning model to prioritize top design candidates, optimizing resource allocation in search processes for inverse design problems.

Result: The active learning-enhanced workflow identified significantly more high-performing candidates (604 on average) than the workflow without active learning (281 on average).

Conclusion: Active learning improves the efficiency and effectiveness of generative AI workflows by reducing resource wastage and preventing model decay, demonstrating significant performance gains in complex design problems like molecular discovery.

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedIF, a scalable and efficient federated learning framework for robust aggregation with significantly reduced computational costs, surpassing Shapley-value-based methods in robustness under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to address robustness issues in federated learning caused by non-IID data and adversarial client behavior, and to overcome the inefficiencies of Shapley-value-based contribution evaluation methods.

Method: The authors propose FedIF, which employs trajectory-based influence estimation to calculate client contributions using gradient operations and a public validation set. This approach includes local weight normalization and influence smoothing to enhance efficiency and robustness.

Result: FedIF demonstrated improved robustness against label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples compared to Shapley-value-based methods while reducing computational overhead by up to 450x. Extensive experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST validated its efficacy.

Conclusion: FedIF is a scalable, robust, and theoretically sound alternative to Shapley-value-based methods, addressing real-world federated learning challenges with significant computational efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

*Amir Moeini,Minjae Kwon,Alper Kamil Bozkurt,Yuichi Motai,Rohan Chandra,Lu Feng,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to ensure safety in In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL), allowing agents to adapt without parameter updates while handling constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the adaptation process in ICRL by accounting for both maximizing rewards and minimizing a cost function, ensuring safe and effective behavior in constrained environments.

Method: Proposes an approach in ICRL under the constrained Markov Decision Processes framework, promoting parameter-free adaptation while managing a cost function and reacting to cost thresholds.

Result: The agent can adjust its behavior—being aggressive or conservative—depending on the cost budget, demonstrating successful adaptation to constraints.

Conclusion: ICRL agents can adapt more safely and flexibly with the proposed method, balancing reward optimization and cost minimization based on environmental constraints.

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical BBO methods struggle with high dimensionality, noise, and mixed-integer settings, motivating the integration of ML and RL techniques for better scalability, robustness, and adaptability.

Method: The paper reviews a variety of ML and RL-enhanced BBO algorithms, including neural networks, policy optimization, and advanced surrogates. It also examines benchmark efforts like the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge.

Result: ML and RL advancements have significantly expanded the capability of classical BBO methods, yielding more robust and scalable solutions.

Conclusion: ML and RL are transforming classical black-box optimization approaches into frameworks that are scalable and effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

### [441] [Binary Sparse Coding for Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25596)
*Lucia Quirke,Stepan Shabalin,Nora Belrose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes binary sparse autoencoders and transcoders to improve interpretability of neural network activations by constraining them to binary values, but finds trade-offs in reconstruction error and ultra-high frequency features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the interpretability of sparse autoencoder features, which are often meaningful only at high activation levels, and address potential polysemanticity in neural activations.

Method: Introduce binary sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs) to constrain activations to binary values (0 or 1), eliminating the distinction between high and low activation strengths.

Result: Binary features improve interpretability and monosemanticity while increasing reconstruction error and producing ultra-high frequency features. Adjusted scores show continuous sparse coders are slightly better in interpretability.

Conclusion: Although binary constraints enhance feature interpretability, the inherent polysemanticity of neural activations may be impossible to fully eliminate, revealing limitations in binary coding approaches.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

*Yixuan Wang,Dan Guralnik,Saiedeh Akbari,Warren Dixon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMP offers a universal and adaptive threshold for pruning, applicable across diverse scoring criteria and models, achieving sparse yet effectively performing neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the core question in model pruning: determining the optimal number of parameters to keep, while achieving comparable performance to dense models.

Method: EMP introduces a novel threshold inspired by the Inverse Simpson index, retaining entries based on a scoring criterion and validating its efficacy across multiple neural architectures and scoring methods.

Result: Sparse models pruned using EMP show competitive performance with dense networks across various architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs).

Conclusion: Using EMP's effective threshold ensures robust model pruning that avoids performance degradation, with flexibility for tailored sparsity levels.

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

*Muhammad Imran Hossain,Jignesh Solanki,Sarika Khushlani Solanki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-BiGAN, a framework utilizing attention Transformers and bidirectional GANs for real-time anomaly detection in power grid data streams, surpassing existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to facilitate reliable anomaly detection in synchrophasor data streams without manual supervision, ensuring power grid resilience.

Method: The method combines window-attention Transformers and BiGAN architecture, with a self-attention encoder-decoder to capture dependencies and an adaptive score for anomaly detection.

Result: T-BiGAN achieves high performance metrics (ROC-AUC of 0.95, average precision 0.996) and is effective in detecting subtle anomalies in grid frequency and voltage.

Conclusion: T-BiGAN exemplifies a powerful, unsupervised, real-time solution for power grid anomaly detection, outperforming current approaches and eliminating reliance on labeled fault data.

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

*Zhendong Mi,Bian Sun,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces D-Rank, a compression method for large language models (LLMs) that utilizes adaptive rank allocation based on information density, outperforming existing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based techniques in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling large language models incurs memory and computational challenges, and existing SVD-based compression techniques overlook the heterogeneity in information density within layers of LLMs.

Method: The authors propose a layer-wise Dynamic Rank allocation framework, D-Rank, using effective rank as a metric to measure information density and optimize rank allocation via a Lagrange multiplier-based scheme. They also adjust for varying importance of attention layers and adapt the framework for modern LLMs with grouped-query attention.

Result: Experiments across various models and compression ratios show D-Rank consistently outperforms competing methods, achieving significant improvements in perplexity, reasoning accuracy, and throughput.

Conclusion: D-Rank offers an advanced, adaptive compression strategy for LLMs that strikes a better balance between efficiency and performance, enabling practical deployment under constrained resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

*Jason Stock,Troy Arcomano,Rao Kotamarthi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Swift, a single-step consistency model for weather forecasting that runs much faster than traditional methods while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diffusion models for weather forecasting are impractical for S2S applications due to slow iterative inference methods.

Method: The proposed Swift framework employs a single-step autoregressive consistency approach with a CRPS objective, avoiding the need for ensemble models or parameter perturbations.

Result: Swift produces stable and skillful forecasts for up to 75 days, running 39x faster than diffusion baselines, and achieves accuracy comparable to operational numerical models.

Conclusion: Swift represents significant progress in creating efficient, reliable probabilistic weather forecasting models for medium to seasonal timescales.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

### [446] [How Does Preconditioning Guide Feature Learning in Deep Neural Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25637)
*Kotaro Yoshida,Atsushi Nitanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the effect of preconditioning on feature learning and generalization in machine learning, revealing that the choice of preconditioner impacts the model's spectral bias and learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many machine learning methods use preconditioning to accelerate empirical risk convergence, but its impact on generalization and feature learning is not well understood.

Method: The authors analyze the role of preconditioners defined by the $p$-th power of the input covariance matrix within a single-index teacher model and explore their implications on feature learning and generalization.

Result: Preconditioners introduce spectral bias, which affects feature learning by emphasizing certain components and suppressing others. Generalization improves when the spectral bias aligns with the teacher's bias.

Conclusion: Preconditioning aids generalization by shaping feature representations, particularly when the spectral emphasis aligns with the learning task defined by the teacher.

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

*Lei Ma,Ling Guo,Hao Wu,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UQ-SONet, an operator learning approach with uncertainty quantification capabilities for scientific machine learning, addressing limitations of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing operator learning methods like DeepONet and VIDON face challenges, such as fixed sensor layouts, inability to handle sparse/incomplete data, and lack of proper uncertainty quantification.

Method: The authors propose UQ-SONet, which incorporates a set transformer embedding for variable sensor setups and a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) for uncertainty quantification, trained using negative ELBO minimization.

Result: UQ-SONet was tested using deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the Navier-Stokes equation, and showed strong performance in terms of robustness, effectiveness, and uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: UQ-SONet advances operator learning by enabling flexible sensor setups, uncertainty quantification, and reliable predictions, making it more practically applicable in scientific tasks.

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

*Qihang Yao,Constantine Dovrolis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes PWMPR, a sparse-to-dense training method to efficiently grow networks, reaching near IMP lottery ticket performance with lower costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for discovering sparse subnetworks with performance comparable to dense models are either computationally expensive or rigid in density assumptions.

Method: PWMPR starts with a sparse seed and incrementally adds edges based on path-kernel-inspired scores and randomization, stopping when accuracy plateaus according to a logistic-fit rule.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PWMPR achieves IMP-level performance across datasets (CIFAR, TinyImageNet, ImageNet) at reduced computational costs compared to iterative pruning methods.

Conclusion: Growth-based network density discovery, exemplified by PWMPR, is an effective and cost-efficient alternative to pruning and dynamic sparsity approaches.

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

*Justin Chih-Yao Chen,Becky Xiangyu Peng,Prafulla Kumar Choubey,Kung-Hsiang Huang,Jiaxin Zhang,Mohit Bansal,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NuRL, a method to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs on unsolvable problems by using self-generated hints, which help models improve performance even on initially untrainable samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of current reinforcement learning algorithms like GRPO that fail to improve model performance on problems that are unsolvable due to the absence of gradients for rewards.

Method: NuRL works by generating self-produced hints to reduce problem difficulty for unsolvable samples. During training, hints are injected based on pass rates, and new rollouts are produced. This produces training signals for unsolvable problems and avoids reliance on external data sources.

Result: NuRL shows consistent performance improvements across six benchmarks and three models. It enables models to expand their upper capabilities and performs better than GRPO, which leaves advanced performance unaltered.

Conclusion: NuRL successfully elevates the upper limit of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through self-generated hints, providing both scalability and dependency-free methods, and offers insights into effective hint design.

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)-based wheelchair development, utilizing a
motor imagery right-left-hand movement mechanism for control. The system is
designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on motor imagery right and
left-hand movements using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A pre-filtered

*Xing Han,Hsing-Huan Chung,Joydeep Ghosh,Paul Pu Liang,Suchi Saria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by considering temporal multimodal interaction dynamics during routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE architectures neglect the dynamic interaction between modalities, limiting expert specialization and effective reasoning.

Method: A multimodal interaction-aware router is proposed, utilizing temporal interaction dynamics to guide token allocation, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

Result: Experiments on multimodal benchmarks showed improved model performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal multimodal interaction dynamics into MoE models improves performance, reasoning, and interpretability.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an activation-matching approach to create concise, human-readable explanations for decisions made by image classifiers, using a lightweight autoencoder, sparsity constraints, and a circuit readout procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting high-dimensional decision rules learned by pre-trained machine learning models and generate faithful, minimal explanations for model predictions.

Method: The authors train a lightweight autoencoder to create binary masks that highlight critical decision regions in images. The approach integrates activational alignment, label consistency, sparsity priors, and robustness constraints. Additionally, a circuit readout procedure evaluates inter-layer connections and channel activations for mechanistic insights.

Result: The method effectively produces minimal input-level explanations that preserve model decisions. It also enables deeper mechanistic interpretation of the internal computations by constructing channel-level graphs and analyzing inter-layer and feature-to-class links.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between generating minimal explanations for model predictions and understanding the internal computational mechanisms, enhancing interpretability and human usability of complex machine learning models.

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

*Zihui Zhao,Yuanbo Tang,Jieyu Ren,Xiaoping Zhang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel regularizer in dictionary learning to encourage sparsity by minimizing redundant atoms, achieving superior reconstruction performance and sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dictionary learning methods focus on sparsity over individual samples but neglect atom sharing across samples, leading to redundant dictionaries and suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose a regularizer based on the row-wise L∞ norm of the coefficient matrix, deriving its foundation from a probabilistic Bayesian model with Beta-Bernoulli priors.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 20% reduction in RMSE, uses fewer than one-tenth of the dictionary atoms, and validates its theoretical basis empirically.

Conclusion: This new approach addresses redundancy in dictionary learning, promoting parsimonious and efficient representations with robust theoretical and experimental support.

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSQA tasks are hindered by a lack of labeled data, and leveraging advancements in VLMs offers potential to address this gap with zero-shot capabilities.

Method: Pseudo labels are generated by VLMs and used to train TSQA models. The inherent robustness of deep neural networks to noisy labels enables effective training despite inaccuracies in pseudo labels.

Result: Experimental results show TSQA models are successfully trained using pseudo labels and achieve higher performance than VLMs by utilizing extensive unlabeled data.

Conclusion: TSQA models trained with VLM-generated pseudo labels not only overcome data scarcity but also outperform the original VLM, demonstrating the utility of this innovative approach.

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot collaboration through accurate and feasible human motion prediction, overcoming limitations like dependency on past poses and ignoring physical constraints.

Method: The method includes incorporating forward and differential kinematics as loss components during training, using a network designed for spatial characteristics of movement, and refining predictions iteratively during inference.

Result: Experimental results show high accuracy, smooth motion transitions, and strong generalization to new subjects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully predicts human motion with limited input data, enhancing practical applications in human-robot interactions.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive graph coarsening method integrating K-means clustering with Graph Neural Network (GNN) training, enabling dynamic node merging during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processing large-scale graphs poses challenges, and existing methods for graph reduction often compromise performance or rely on preprocessing steps.

Method: The approach combines graph coarsening and GNN training by utilizing K-means clustering on node embeddings for dynamic node merging, bypassing traditional preprocessing steps.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification tasks, showcasing adaptability of the coarsened graph during training.

Conclusion: The adaptive coarsening method enhances the training process of GNNs by dynamically adjusting to tasks, making it applicable to challenging scenarios like heterophilic data.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task

TL;DR: The paper proposes Expert Merging and Expert Merging++, methods to efficiently combine multiple specialized models into a single high-performing model using unlabeled data, avoiding expensive training and manual tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create broad-capability models by combining multiple specialized models without the high cost and limitations of joint training or serving multiple models.

Method: Introduced Expert Merging, which learns layer-wise coefficients from unlabeled calibration data to align hidden states and logits of the merged model with the expert models, including a stability regularizer and task-weighted losses. Expert Merging++ adds importance-guided chunking to allocate resources dynamically across layers based on layer importance metrics.

Result: The methods surpassed strong training-free and training-based baselines in merging multiple models across multimodal and language-only backbones (InternVL, Qwen2-VL, Mistral) and, in some cases, even outperformed supervised Mixture Training.

Conclusion: Expert Merging and its augmentation Expert Merging++ present a scalable, label-free, and parameter-efficient solution for merging large language and multimodal models, offering state-of-the-art performance in the task.

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

### [458] [Reweighted Flow Matching via Unbalanced OT for Label-free Long-tailed Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25713)
*Hyunsoo Song,Minjung Gim,Jaewoong Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UOT-RFM, a novel method to improve generative modeling for long-tailed distributions without relying on class labels, addressing majority bias in flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flow matching struggles with imbalanced, long-tailed data distributions, making it challenging to generate minority modes accurately.

Method: The method uses Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for constructing conditional vector fields and employs an inverse reweighting strategy based on a label-free majority score.

Result: UOT-RFM theoretically restores long-tailed distributions through first-order and higher-order corrections, achieving superior results on imbalanced benchmarks and maintaining competitiveness on balanced datasets.

Conclusion: UOT-RFM successfully mitigates majority bias in generative modeling, improving minority class fidelity and overall model performance across imbalanced and balanced datasets.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

*Hanghui Guo,Shimin Di,Pasquale De Meo,Zhangze Chen,Jia Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the MuPlon framework for claim verification, addressing data noise and biases using causal interventions through back-door and front-door paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional claim verification methods often fail to account for the complex interactions between evidence, resulting in unreliable results.

Method: Proposes the Multi-Path Causal Optimization (MuPlon) framework, which uses a dual causal intervention strategy: the back-door path to optimize node weights and strengthen relevant connections, and the front-door path to extract subgraphs and utilize counterfactual reasoning to reduce biases.

Result: MuPlon delivers superior accuracy in claim verification tasks, outperforming existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MuPlon effectively addresses longstanding challenges in claim verification by mitigating noise and biases, advancing the reliability of data quality control systems.

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

*Haozhe Lei,Hao Guo,Tommy Svensson,Sundeep Rangan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel localization method using Monte Carlo sampling and neural scoring networks to estimate transmitter locations and quantify uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless systems need accurate position estimates and uncertainty quantification for better planning, control, and resource management.

Method: The authors present MC-CLE, which trains neural scoring networks through Monte Carlo sampling, allowing for comparison between real and candidate transmitter locations.

Result: In simulations, MC-CLE effectively learns properties like angular ambiguity and antenna patterns, while achieving lower cross-entropy loss compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: MC-CLE represents a promising approach for improving transmitter localization accuracy and uncertainty modeling in wireless systems.

Abstract: Modern wireless systems require not only position estimates, but also
quantified uncertainty to support planning, control, and radio resource
management. We formulate localization as posterior inference of an unknown
transmitter location from receiver measurements. We propose Monte Carlo
Candidate-Likelihood Estimation (MC-CLE), which trains a neural scoring network
using Monte Carlo sampling to compare true and candidate transmitter locations.
We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE
learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back
antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a
uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss
metric.

*Indu Kant Deo,Akash Venkateshwaran,Rajeev K. Jaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-guided probabilistic framework for predicting three-dimensional underwater acoustic transmission loss, focusing on real-world applications in sustainable maritime operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing underwater noise pollution from ship traffic necessitates real-time ocean acoustic digital twins to mitigate its impacts, especially on marine ecosystems.

Method: The framework uses machine learning approaches like sparse variational Gaussian processes, deep kernel learning, and physics-based mean functions, integrating bathymetry, sound transmission dynamics, and calibrated uncertainty measures.

Result: The framework successfully predicts transmission loss and provides sound exposure level estimates for mitigating acoustic effects, specifically supporting ship speed optimization to reduce marine mammal noises.

Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of physics-guided machine learning in creating uncertainty-aware digital twins, enabling more sustainable approaches to maritime operations.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

*Yanan Zhao,Feng Ji,Jingyang Dai,Jiaze Ma,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple yet effective graph contrastive learning model leveraging complementary structural and feature views to enhance performance on heterophilic graphs without requiring complex augmentation or negative sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in applying graph contrastive learning (GCL) effectively to heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different classes, and question the necessity of overly complex methods for this setting.

Method: The proposed method combines a GCN encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to mitigate node feature noise. It avoids complex augmentation and negative sampling by leveraging inherent feature and structural views of the graph.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on heterophilic graphs with minimal computational and memory costs and shows advantages in complexity, scalability, and robustness against adversarial attacks on homophilic graphs.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of pairing structural and feature-based views for contrastive learning on graphs, achieving robustness and efficiency while simplifying the overall GCL process.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

*Xiang Zhang,Kun Wei,Xu Yang,Chenghao Xu,Su Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU) to address continuous unlearning in Large Language Models without relying on retained datasets, while minimizing utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for Large Language Models suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss and often require retained datasets, which are impractical in many scenarios.

Method: RCU uses rotational salience weight to control the degree of unlearning during continuous requests. It introduces a skew symmetric loss to define cognitive rotation space and designs orthogonal rotation axes regularization to minimize interference.

Result: RCU achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets without requiring a retained dataset.

Conclusion: RCU effectively addresses the challenges of continuous unlearning in LLMs, mitigating both utility loss and reliance on retained datasets.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

*Kaizhuo Yan,Yingjie Yu,Yifan Yu,Haizhong Zheng,Fan Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPPO is an efficient framework for improving Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), using techniques to reduce dependency and latency in the training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in PPO-based RLHF training pipelines, particularly due to sequential multi-model dependencies and straggling caused by long-tail response lengths.

Method: OPPO introduces two techniques: Intra-step overlap, which allows streaming of upstream model outputs in chunks to reduce idle time, and Inter-step overlap, which overcommits prompts while deferring long computations to manage latency.

Result: OPPO speeds up the training process by 1.8x-2.8x and enhances GPU utilization by 1.4x-2.1x, without sacrificing training convergence.

Conclusion: OPPO is a lightweight and model-agnostic solution that significantly improves the efficiency of PPO-based RLHF training pipelines, requiring only minimal changes to existing implementations.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

### [465] [Autonomy-Aware Clustering: When Local Decisions Supersede Global Prescriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25775)
*Amber Srivastava,Salar Basiri,Srinivasa Salapaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for autonomy-aware clustering, addressing the challenge of local autonomy in clustering entities. The approach is shown to close the gap between inferred and ground truth solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering methods typically assume entities strictly conform to their assigned groups, which ignores the local autonomy exhibited by entities that can affect clustering results in substantive ways.

Method: The proposed method integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with deterministic annealing (DA) to model clustering behavior, and incorporates a transformer-based Adaptive Distance Estimation Network (ADEN) for flexibility and adaptability.

Result: The framework achieves clustering solutions closely aligned with ground truth data (3-4% gap), outperforming traditional models which ignore autonomy (35-40% gap).

Conclusion: Accounting for local autonomy in clustering significantly improves clustering accuracy, and the proposed framework effectively addresses this challenge using RL and ADEN models.

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper constructs neural networks using information geometry principles, specifically the lognormal statistical manifold, creating an architecture driven by Hamiltonian systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between information geometry and machine learning by inherently designing neural networks on statistical manifolds, ensuring geometric interpretability and principled construction.

Method: Neural networks are formulated on the lognormal statistical manifold. Inputs use the coordinate system of Hamiltonian dynamics in the Poincare disk, weights are derived from SU(1,1) Lie group action, and activation functions arise from the symplectic structure.

Result: A unique neural network architecture is derived that respects the geometric properties of the lognormal manifold, allowing interpretable and principled machine learning designs.

Conclusion: The study establishes a paradigm where differential geometry influences neural network construction, offering interpretability and novel design principles for learning systems.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage pretrained framework to enhance neural operator learning for PDE simulations using transformer-based autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational challenge and limited labeled data availability in traditional PDE simulation-based design evaluations.

Method: A two-stage framework involving a geometry reconstruction pretraining phase, followed by supervised neural operator training using pretrained embeddings.

Result: Empirical results across four PDE datasets show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy compared to models using raw point cloud inputs.

Conclusion: Physics-agnostic pretraining establishes a strong foundation for efficient PDE solution predictions, exploiting abundant geometry-only data.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

*Gongxu Luo,Loka Li,Guangyi Chen,Haoyue Dai,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of post-treatment selection in interventional causal discovery, common in biological studies, by proposing a novel causal formulation, a new graphical diagram (F-PAG), and a provably sound algorithm (F-FCI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past research in interventional causal discovery often overlooks post-treatment selection, which introduces spurious dependencies mimicking causal responses, thus hindering the identification of true causal structures. This challenge is particularly prevalent in biological studies.

Method: The authors introduce a new causal formulation that accounts for post-treatment selection. They propose a Fine-grained Interventional Markov equivalence class (FI-Markov equivalence), represented by the F-PAG diagram, and design a provably sound and complete algorithm (F-FCI) to handle observational and interventional data.

Result: The proposed F-FCI algorithm successfully recovers causal relations in the presence of both post-treatment selection and latent confounders, validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The paper offers a robust solution to address post-treatment selection in causal discovery. By modeling this overlooked factor, it advances causal inference accuracy and extends the ability to uncover true causal structures even in complex settings.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

from ECG signals, emphasizing diagnostic accuracy and interpretability using
Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost
and LightGBM. The models were trained and tested on ECG data from the publicly
available MIMIC-IV dataset. The testing was carried out with the assistance of
accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

*Yuheng Zhang,Wenlin Yao,Changlong Yu,Yao Liu,Qingyu Yin,Bing Yin,Hyokun Yun,Lihong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AR3PO is proposed to improve reasoning in LLMs through adaptive rollout and response reuse, surpassing past methods like GRPO and matching DAPO with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vanishing advantage issue in group-based RLVR methods like GRPO and improve sampling efficiency in fine-tuning LLMs.

Method: Introduce AR3PO, an RLVR algorithm with two techniques: adaptive rollout for dynamic response allocation and response reuse to leverage correct prior responses for training.

Result: AR3PO outperforms GRPO consistently, matches or surpasses DAPO on smaller LLMs (7B, 8B), and achieves comparable performance to DAPO on larger LLMs (32B) while significantly reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: AR3PO is an efficient and effective RLVR approach, offering significant performance improvements and computational efficiency in training reasoning abilities in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar

*Kun Feng,Shaocheng Lan,Yuchen Fang,Wenchao He,Lintao Ma,Xingyu Lu,Kan Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kairos is a new time series foundation model (TSFM) that improves on existing models by using adaptive tokenization and positional embeddings, excelling in zero-shot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of heterogeneous information density in time series data, which current TSFMs fail to handle due to non-adaptive processing pipelines.

Method: Kairos incorporates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding to adaptively process time series data. It is trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series corpus.

Result: Kairos achieves superior zero-shot performance with fewer parameters compared to existing methods on benchmarks like GIFT-Eval and Time-Series-Library.

Conclusion: Dynamic adaptation in tokenization and positional encoding allows Kairos to outperform traditional TSFMs on diverse tasks, demonstrating its potential to handle heterogeneous time series more effectively.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

### [472] [MIDAS: Misalignment-based Data Augmentation Strategy for Imbalanced Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25831)
*Seong-Hyeon Hwang,Soyoung Choi,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIDAS introduces a novel data augmentation method to tackle modality imbalance in multimodal models through misaligned samples and dynamic weighting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of modality imbalance, where multimodal models overly rely on dominant modalities and underperform, seeking data-centric solutions.

Method: MIDAS creates misaligned samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information. It utilizes confidence-based labeling and introduces weak-modality weighting to amplify weaker modalities, alongside hard-sample weighting to prioritize semantically ambiguous samples.

Result: MIDAS achieves significantly better performance compared to related baselines in multimodal classification tasks, mitigating modality imbalance.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the effectiveness of data-centric strategies, particularly MIDAS, for improving modality balance in multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

### [473] [Distillation of Large Language Models via Concrete Score Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25837)
*Yeongmin Kim,Donghyeok Shin,Mina Kang,Byeonghu Na,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concrete Score Distillation (CSD), an improved knowledge distillation method for large language models, overcoming limitations of existing objectives and achieving better scalability, fidelity, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is expensive, necessitating efficient inference techniques like knowledge distillation (KD). Current KD approaches suffer from softmax smoothing issues or constraints on solution space, which need improvement.

Method: The proposed method, Concrete Score Distillation (CSD), formulates a discrete score-matching objective to address softmax-induced smoothing and solution space restrictions. CSD considers relative logit differences across vocabulary pairs with flexible weighting and balances mode-seeking and mode-covering strategies. It also resolves instability and quadratic complexity of discrete score-matching.

Result: Experimental evaluations on multiple LLMs like GPT-2-1.5B, OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT demonstrate that CSD consistently outperforms recent KD objectives. It delivers improved fidelity-diversity trade-offs and shows complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques.

Conclusion: CSD proves to be scalable and effective for LLM distillation, offering enhanced performance compared to existing KD methods and achieving favorable balance in inference efficiency, scalability, and diversity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

*Suping Xu,Chuyi Dai,Ye Liu,Lin Shang,Xibei Yang,Witold Pedrycz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces S$^2$FS, a new feature selection framework that improves fuzzy decision systems by considering spatial separability for better decision-boundary clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature selection methods in fuzzy decision systems either do not directly align evaluation criteria with learning goals or rely on non-directional Euclidean distances, limiting their ability to clarify decision boundaries.

Method: The proposed approach, S$^2$FS, introduces a spatially-aware separability criterion that accounts for within-class compactness and between-class separation, combining scalar-distance and spatial-directional information. It employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select discriminative features.

Result: Experiments on ten real-world datasets show S$^2$FS outperforms eight existing algorithms in classification accuracy and clustering performance. Feature visualizations confirm improved interpretability.

Conclusion: S$^2$FS provides a robust and interpretable solution for feature selection in fuzzy decision systems, enhancing predictive performance and decision clarity.

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

### [475] [Knapsack RL: Unlocking Exploration of LLMs via Optimizing Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25849)
*Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Tianyun Yang,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of computational inefficiency in reinforcement learning of Large Language Models (LLMs), proposing an adaptive resource allocation method based on the knapsack problem to optimize exploration budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the exploration process in reinforcement learning for LLMs because uniform budget allocation leads to inefficiencies, like consistently failing difficult tasks and zero-gradient updates.

Method: The authors apply a knapsack problem formulation to adaptively reallocate exploration budgets by evaluating the learning value and cost of different tasks during training.

Result: Their method increased the proportion of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40%, allowed for significantly larger budgets for hard problems, and improved mathematical reasoning benchmarks by 2-4 average points, with peak gains of 9 points.

Conclusion: The approach delivers substantial performance gains and computational savings, achieving results comparable to uniform allocation but with about half the resource requirements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

*Animesh Jha,Harshit Gupta,Ananjan Nandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an RL-based method to optimize data selection for finetuning LLMs, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection approaches for fine-tuning LLMs struggle with budget constraints and transfer poorly from pretraining contexts.

Method: The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process, and Reinforcement Learning is used to train agents with a proxy-model-based reward signal to optimize data selection.

Result: The approach matches or beats full dataset fine-tuning by up to 10.8 accuracy points while reducing training time by up to 2x on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: RL-guided data selection is a promising direction for improving the efficiency and performance of LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

### [477] [Efficient On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Exploration of Sparse Parameter Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25876)
*Xinyu Zhang,Aishik Deb,Klaus Mueller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in policy-gradient methods like PPO that update parameters along a single gradient direction, and introduces a method (ExploRLer) to explore unexplored parameter space for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current policy-gradient methods fail to explore the local parameter space effectively, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduce ExploRLer, a pipeline that integrates with on-policy algorithms like PPO and TRPO to systematically explore unexplored neighborhoods around current policy updates.

Result: ExploRLer significantly improves performance over baseline methods in complex continuous control environments without increasing the number of gradient updates.

Conclusion: Iteration-level exploration offers a practical and efficient solution to enhance on-policy reinforcement learning, addressing limitations of the existing surrogate objective approach.

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

*Yiwei Li,Shuai Wang,Zhuojun Tian,Xiuhua Wang,Shijian Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MS-PAFL, a federated learning framework combining model splitting and statistical privacy amplification to enhance privacy while minimizing accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation of model accuracy caused by the noise added for differential privacy in federated learning.

Method: Proposes a model-splitting approach where client models are divided into private and public submodels, with noise only added to the public submodel. This is combined with statistical privacy amplification methods like random client participation and local data subsampling.

Result: The framework significantly reduces the noise required to maintain a specified privacy level and achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility in experiments.

Conclusion: MS-PAFL improves federated learning by achieving strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high model accuracy, outperforming traditional methods in the privacy-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: The paper reconsiders fundamental principles in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) and proposes a new framework, improving performance with simple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current progress in LTSF focuses too much on architectural complexity, overlooking fundamental forecasting principles.

Method: Proposes a Boosted Direct Output (BDO) strategy combining advantages of Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO), with stabilized parameter tracking for better learning.

Result: The approach enables even simple MLP models to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming complex contemporary methods.

Conclusion: A principled and simplified approach can outperform complex models in LTSF, offering new insights and research directions.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a fast, energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. This paper explores their scalability, output layer design, and performance on large multi-class datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLGNs have gained attention as a speed- and efficiency-focused alternative, but their scalability and output design, especially on large-scale datasets, remain underexplored.

Method: The study evaluates DLGNs' general expressiveness and alternative output strategies through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, emphasizing temperature tuning and the Group-Sum layer.

Result: The analysis reveals the importance of temperature tuning and identifies conditions under which the Group-Sum layer performs effectively, scaling DLGNs to handle up to 2000 classes.

Conclusion: The results enhance understanding of DLGNs' scalability and inform strategies for their large-scale multi-class classification applications.

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

*Mason Minot,Gisbert Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AIM, a framework that addresses gradient conflicts in multi-task learning for molecular property optimization, achieving improved performance in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing multiple conflicting molecular properties is crucial but challenging due to destructive gradient interference in multi-task learning, exacerbated in data-scarce drug discovery scenarios.

Method: The proposed AIM framework uses a dynamic policy trained with dense, differentiable regularizers to mediate gradient conflicts, ensuring geometric stability and dynamic efficiency in updates.

Result: AIM demonstrated statistically significant improvements over existing baselines on QM9 and protein degrader benchmarks, particularly in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: AIM not only enhances multi-task learning performance but also provides interpretability of inter-task relationships, holding promise for advancing molecular design and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient workflow based on one-dimensional CNNs for autonomous Raman spectroscopy classification, addressing challenges like fluorescence distortion, peak shifts, and limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve Raman spectrum classification in autonomous exploration settings, where distortions and limited labeled data present significant challenges.

Method: This study uses one-dimensional CNNs trained on raw spectra, incorporating semi-supervised learning, pooling adjustments, and lightweight retraining for adaptability to unseen minerals.

Result: Key results include surpassing traditional methods in classification accuracy, accommodating spectral shifts through pooling, achieving better performance with limited labels, and enabling cost-efficient model adaptation.

Conclusion: The presented workflow offers a practical solution for robust, accurate, and resource-efficient Raman classification, advancing autonomous exploration capabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional federated learning, which struggles with data heterogeneity, model diversity, catastrophic forgetting, and the newly identified issue of knowledge misalignment.

Method: The proposed FedDCL utilizes pre-trained diffusion models to create class-specific prototypes that enable synthetic data generation, exemplar-free generative replay, and data-free knowledge transfer in a model-heterogeneous federated learning environment.

Result: Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that FedDCL effectively mitigates the identified challenges and enhances the performance of federated learning systems.

Conclusion: FedDCL represents a promising advancement for federated learning in dynamic and complex scenarios, improving adaptability, privacy preservation, and model generalizability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

*Gaojie Jin,Xinping Yi,Xiaowei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalization error bound with certified robustness for smoothed majority vote classifiers, connecting robustness with spectral norms and proposing spectral regularization for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical research on the certified robustness of majority vote classifiers and explore its relation with generalization performance.

Method: The authors develop a generalization error bound with a certified robust radius, utilize spherical Gaussian inputs, and propose an inexpensive spectral regularizer for smooth training.

Result: Theoretical insights on robustness generalization were achieved, and empirical results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed spectral regularizer.

Conclusion: The interplay between generalization and certified robustness can be strengthened using spectral regularization, providing both theoretical contributions and practical improvements.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Mykola Bordyuh,Djork-Arné Clevert,Marco Bertolini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Quantum Schrödinger Bridge Problem (QSBP), describing stochastic processes governed by quantum dynamics, derives solutions for Gaussian distributions, and proposes a new algorithm for applications in generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to extend the Schrödinger Bridge Problem to the quantum domain to explore non-classical stochastic processes for generative modeling and practical applications in diverse fields.

Method: The authors formulate the QSBP from a Lagrangian perspective, solve related equations like the Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi Equations to derive exact solutions for QSBP between Gaussian distributions, and adapt a Gaussian Mixture Model framework for computational implementation.

Result: The study finds that QSBP solutions for Gaussian distributions remain Gaussian but exhibit distinct covariance evolution due to quantum effects. An algorithm is developed and tested successfully in image generation, molecular translation, single-cell evolution, and Mean-Field Games.

Conclusion: Quantum stochastic dynamics captured by QSBP are effective for modeling complex generative processes, offering valuable insights and tools for applications ranging from biology to artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAST, a sparsity-aware training framework for efficient N:M sparse models, achieving better perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create hardware-friendly large language models with reduced latency and memory by transforming them into sparse patterns during training.

Method: CAST uses three novel components: AdamS optimizer, Weight Scaling to balance sparsity and magnitude, and Knowledge Distillation to enhance training.

Result: CAST achieves state-of-the-art performance in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy under 2:4 sparsity patterns, with minimal computational resources and robust prediction scaling laws.

Conclusion: CAST demonstrates significant efficiency and applicability in training sparse models, making them practical for downstream quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

*Bissmella Bahaduri,Hicham Talaoubrid,Fangchen Feng,Zuheng Ming,Anissa Mokraoui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Indirect Attention," a modified attention mechanism that addresses challenges posed by noisy value features and context misalignment in attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standard attention mechanisms when dealing with noisy value features and context misalignment, as these issues significantly degrade the effectiveness of attention models.

Method: The authors analyzed the impact of noise and context misalignment within value features, proposed "Indirect Attention" as a modified attention mechanism, and evaluated it on synthetic tasks and real-world applications to demonstrate its benefits.

Result: The study showed that Indirect Attention significantly outperforms traditional attention mechanisms in handling noise and context misalignment, both on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Indirect Attention is a robust solution for scenarios where standard attention fails due to noise and misalignment, making it a valuable improvement for deep learning architectures.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

TL;DR: A study introduces the Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), an NLP system to classify sustainability data for fashion brands using transformer-based models, addressing challenges in accessing credible sustainability information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited and complex access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry, amidst increasing demands for transparency.

Method: Development of a transformer-based system (FITS) fine-tuning BERT-based models on a curated dataset with Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters. It extracts and classifies data from credible texts like NGO reports and scientific publications. The tool was assessed with focus groups.

Result: The prototype FITS demonstrated its utility in promoting access to credible sustainability data through NLP. User evaluations emphasized its usability and potential enhancements.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted NLP can support informed decision-making in the fashion industry. The study also contributes a valuable methodology, dataset, and showcases AI's role in climate-related challenges.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

### [489] [Muon Outperforms Adam in Tail-End Associative Memory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26030)
*Shuche Wang,Fengzhuo Zhang,Jiaxiang Li,Cunxiao Du,Chao Du,Tianyu Pang,Zhuoran Yang,Mingyi Hong,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon optimizer outperforms Adam in training LLMs due to better handling of tail classes under heavy-tailed distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why the Muon optimizer is consistently faster and superior to Adam in training LLMs through the lens of associative memory.

Method: The study ablates key transformer components and analyzes real-world heavy-tailed corpora along with theoretical modeling of a one-layer associative memory system.

Result: Muon achieves more isotropic singular spectra and optimizes tail classes more effectively than Adam, confirmed empirically and theoretically.

Conclusion: The Muon optimizer leverages its update rule's alignment with associative memory structures to ensure balanced and effective learning for tail classes in heavy data distributions.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

*Xiaobao Wang,Ruoxiao Sun,Yujun Zhang,Bingdao Feng,Dongxiao He,Luzhi Wang,Di Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor attack framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) that addresses structural and semantic anomalies, enhancing both attack success and stealth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph classification backdoor methods are easily detectable due to structural and semantic deviations caused by rare subgraph triggers and label flipping.

Method: The proposed DPSBA framework employs adversarial training with anomaly-aware discriminators to create in-distribution triggers for clean-label attacks.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate DPSBA's superior balance between attack effectiveness and detectability compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: DPSBA suppresses inherent anomalies in backdoor attacks on GNNs, proving to be a more stealthy and effective solution for graph classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### [491] [Scaling Up Temporal Domain Generalization via Temporal Experts Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26045)
*Aoming Liu,Kevin Miller,Venkatesh Saligrama,Kate Saenko,Boqing Gong,Ser-Nam Lim,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA), a scalable framework for addressing temporal distribution shifts efficiently, achieving significant improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) fail to effectively generalize across temporal changes due to limitations in predicting full model weights or focusing solely on the classifier layer.

Method: TEA uses weight averaging across expertly trained temporal models with functional diversity and parameter similarity. It incorporates adaptive averaging coefficients based on temporal weight trajectories to optimize generalization and computational efficiency.

Result: TEA achieves up to 69% improvement in accuracy and is up to 60 times more computationally efficient across seven benchmarks, five models, and two TDG settings.

Conclusion: TEA is a novel, scalable solution that generalizes effectively across temporal domains, surpassing previous methods in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

### [492] [Clip-Low Increases Entropy and Clip-High Decreases Entropy in Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26114)
*Jaesung R. Park,Junsu Kim,Gyeongman Kim,Jinyoung Jo,Sean Choi,Jaewoong Cho,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates how clipping mechanisms in PPO/GRPO drive changes in entropy during RLVR training and demonstrates a way to mitigate entropy collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy collapse limits the progress and exploration potential of large language models during RLVR training. Understanding the role of clipping mechanisms is crucial to overcoming this challenge.

Method: The paper provides both theoretical and empirical analyses of PPO and GRPO clipping mechanisms, showing their distinct effects on entropy. It further proposes adjusting clip-low values to control entropy.

Result: The analysis reveals biases induced by clip-low and clip-high that either increase or decrease entropy, respectively. The dominant effect of clip-high under standard parameters leads to entropy reduction.

Conclusion: Clipping has a significant, overlooked impact on entropy and reasoning behaviors in RLVR. Adjusting clipping strategies can enhance exploration and prevent entropy collapse in training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UncertainGen, a probabilistic embedding framework, advances metagenomic binning by modeling sequence-level uncertainty, outperforming traditional deterministic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metagenomic binning methods struggle with DNA sequence uncertainties caused by inter-species DNA sharing and similar fragment representations.

Method: UncertainGen uses a probabilistic embedding approach to represent DNA fragments as distributions in latent space, offering theoretical guarantees on distinguishability and a flexible clustering framework.

Result: Experiments on real datasets show UncertainGen improves upon k-mer and LLM-based embeddings in task performance, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The probabilistic embedding approach of UncertainGen offers a robust and adaptable method for metagenomic binning, addressing inherent sequence uncertainties effectively.

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how hyperparameters in HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) impact performance in two manufacturing tasks. It demonstrates that tailored design yields faster and more energy-efficient AI models compared to deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI solutions for edge-based smart manufacturing struggle to meet latency and energy constraints while ensuring accurate performance. The paper explores HDC's potential as a lightweight alternative.

Method: Analyzed hyperparameter impacts in HDC for CNC signal-based quality monitoring and LPBF image-based defect detection. Developed formal complexity models and conducted empirical experiments.

Result: Domain-specific tuned HDC models achieved similar or better accuracy compared to deep learning models, with 6x faster inference and over 40x lower training energy.

Conclusion: Domain-aware HDC encoding provides scalable solutions for industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will focus on adaptive encoders, broader applications, and validation on low-power platforms.

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

*Daniil Zelezetsky,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the instability of transformer-based models in model-free online reinforcement learning (RL) by proposing a two-stage training method using Accelerator policy and demonstrating improved stability, speed, and resource efficiency across robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models in RL face challenges of instability and implementation issues, which hinder their effective application, especially in model-free online RL.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage algorithm where the Accelerator policy first trains a transformer through behavior cloning, followed by the transformer engaging in direct online interactions with the environment.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows reduced training time (up to 2x faster), enhanced stability, and lower replay buffer size requirements when applying the method to ManiSkill and MuJoCo environments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully addresses instability issues, enabling transformer-based models to train faster and with reduced computational demands in RL tasks.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a high demand for large-scale and numerous fire simulations, which are currently time and energy-intensive.

Method: They use a custom machine learning surrogate model, guided optimization to minimize the number of simulations, and a framework called Simvue for efficiency and reusability.

Result: Their model predicts heat propagation dynamics significantly faster than state-of-the-art CFD software, reduces fire simulation quantity tenfold for specific objectives, and streamlines simulation management using Simvue.

Conclusion: The approach offers substantial improvements in fire simulation time, energy, and management while reducing redundancy and enabling efficient reuse of data.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of aligning large language models effectively in natural language processing motivates the exploration of novel methods.

Method: AAD enhances alignment through implicit reward optimization at inference, building on the established DPO setup and requiring no additional specialized training.

Result: Empirical results show that AAD consistently outperforms strong alignment baselines across benchmarks and model scales and generates useful synthetic data in data-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: AAD serves as a practical and high-performing tool for improving alignment in language models, particularly in environments with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based geospatial machine learning framework using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to improve informal settlement classification in urban areas, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geospatial machine learning approaches for mapping informal settlements often overlook the relational structure of urban environments, leading to limitations in classification and urban scene understanding.

Method: The study embeds spatial units (cells) in a graph structure with their neighbors and uses a lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for classification. Validation is conducted on diverse zones in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation.

Result: The proposed graph-based framework significantly outperformed traditional baseline methods, enhancing classification performance by improving the Kappa coefficient by 17 points.

Conclusion: Graph-based modeling provides a robust improvement in mapping informal settlements by leveraging spatial structure, with benefits over both standard methods and feature concatenation approaches.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINO is a novel neural operator model designed to tackle PDEs efficiently by using local mechanisms instead of global ones, resulting in better accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of global mixing mechanisms in current neural PDE solvers, which oversmooth local dynamics and are computationally expensive.

Method: FINO adopts a finite-difference-inspired approach, with learnable convolutional kernels and a time-stepping scheme embedded in an encoder-decoder architecture featuring a Local Operator Block.

Result: FINO demonstrates up to 44% lower error and nearly 2× speedups across benchmarks and a climate modeling task compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Strict locality, combined with learnable time-stepping, creates a scalable and accurate foundation for neural PDE solvers, outperforming traditional operator-learning models.

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

TL;DR: TFPI is introduced as a modification to the RLVR technique to reduce computational costs and improve training efficiency by discarding unnecessary content during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR demands long context lengths leading to high computational costs, and existing mitigation strategies, such as multi-stage training, fail significantly in reducing overall compute.

Method: The authors propose TFPI, which incorporates a ThinkFree operation that discards thinking content via a "</think>" append, reducing token usage and improving performance during training and inference.

Result: Experiments show that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves higher performance, and produces token-efficient reasoning models. Example performance includes 89% accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench with reduced computing resources.

Conclusion: TFPI is a simple yet effective adaptation to RLVR that improves training efficiency and model performance, achieving this without needing complex reward systems or training methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall

effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Aaya Bougrine,Salmane El Mansour Billah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning-driven approach to enhance Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) while optimizing energy use in buildings, benchmarked using advanced neural network models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve occupant health and productivity while reducing the high energy costs associated with traditional HVAC systems.

Method: Used deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM) to analyze the ROBOD dataset and forecast IEQ variables for different time horizons.

Result: GRU showed the best short-term prediction accuracy, CNN-LSTM excelled in long-term feature extraction, and LSTM proved effective for long-range temporal modeling.

Conclusion: The insights enable predictive HVAC control to reduce energy consumption and improve occupant comfort in intelligent building systems.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

### [502] [Marginal Flow: a flexible and efficient framework for density estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26221)
*Marcello Massimo Negri,Jonathan Aellen,Manuel Jahn,AmirEhsan Khorashadizadeh,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Marginal Flow introduces an efficient framework for density modeling, surpassing limitations such as expensive training, mode collapse, and architectural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for density modeling often face challenges like slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode collapse, or restrictive architectures.

Method: Marginal Flow uses a parametric distribution with latent parameters and marginalizes them out by sampling from a learnable distribution.

Result: It achieves exact density evaluation, faster training and inference than competing methods, and supports flexible architectures and applications.

Conclusion: Marginal Flow proves to be a versatile and efficient framework for various density modeling tasks, handling diverse objectives and multi-modal targets effectively.

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

### [503] [Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26234)
*Ayush Patnaik,Adam B Zufall,Stephen K Robinson,Xinfan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a noise-aware and probabilistic Gaussian Process (GP) framework to reliably detect lithium plating via charge-voltage data analysis, demonstrating its effectiveness in experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lithium plating is a key degradation issue during fast charging, leading to capacity fade and safety risks. Reliable detection, especially through dQ/dV analysis, faces limitations due to noise amplification and biases in conventional methodologies.

Method: The paper proposes using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the charge-voltage relationship probabilistically. Derivatives and uncertainty are computed analytically, avoiding the need for noise filtering, and enabling scalable online detection suitable for Battery Management Systems (BMS).

Result: Experimental validation using Li-ion coin cells over various charging rates and temperatures confirms the method's accuracy in detecting lithium plating. It reliably identifies plating peaks under challenging conditions while avoiding false positives in baseline cases.

Conclusion: The Gaussian Process framework provides a robust and practical solution for real-time lithium plating detection, effectively addressing issues of noise and scalability, and paving the way for enhanced battery safety and longevity.

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

*James Oldfield,Philip Torr,Ioannis Patras,Adel Bibi,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs) as a flexible activation monitoring solution for large language models (LLMs), enabling dynamic evaluation to reduce costs and enhance safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional safety monitors for LLMs often require equal computational effort irrespective of query complexity, leading to either inefficiency or risks of missing subtle harmful cases.

Method: The authors introduce TPCs, a method for progressive activation monitoring where polynomial classifiers evaluate terms sequentially, allowing for adjustable computational expenditure based on the complexity or risk level of inputs.

Result: TPCs demonstrated competitive or superior performance against MLP-based safety monitors on two datasets while offering improved interpretability.

Conclusion: TPCs provide a practical and adaptive framework for LLM safety monitoring, balancing computational resource usage with robust guardrails for differing input complexities.

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at
http://github.com/james-oldfield/tpc.

### [505] [From Fragile to Certified: Wasserstein Audits of Group Fairness Under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26241)
*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework called Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Fairness (WDF) to improve the stability and reliability of group-fairness metrics under resampling and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-fairness metrics often become unreliable due to their high sensitivity to resamples and distribution shifts, creating challenges for fair evaluations and certifications under such conditions.

Method: The authors introduce a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework that defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF) as a fairness certification target. They use strong duality to design an efficient estimator (DRUNE) and prove its applicability through theoretical guarantees.

Result: The paper demonstrates that $\varepsilon$-WDF provides consistent, stable fairness evaluations across standard benchmarks, classifiers, and under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed $\varepsilon$-WDF framework provides a robust, principled paradigm for auditing and certifying group fairness under realistic conditions, addressing limitations of observational data evaluations.

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

### [506] [Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization Through the Lens of Structural Causal Models and Individual Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26275)
*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) in addressing individual fairness under causal and sensitive attribute considerations. It reformulates and simplifies the DRO problem, analyzing its efficiency and robustness in data-driven decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap in applying DRO to individual fairness problems, with causal structures and sensitive attributes considered. The need is driven by uncertainty in decision-making processes.

Method: The authors reformulate DRO from a causality and fairness perspective, develop its dual formation for computational efficiency, derive approximations for worst-case losses as regularizers, and analyze scenarios where empirical distributions and estimated causal structures are used.

Result: The paper provides closed-form approximations for DRO's worst-case losses, explores its connection with classical robust optimization, and develops efficient solutions without assuming prior knowledge of structural causal models.

Conclusion: The research ensures efficiency, fairness, and robustness in the use of DRO for data-driven decision-making under distributional and causal uncertainty, enhancing its applicability and reliability in such contexts.

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

*Anthony Zhou,Alexander Wikner,Amaury Lancelin,Pedram Hassanzadeh,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights the advantages of using stochastic interpolants as opposed to Gaussian-based generative models for predicting physical systems like PDEs and dynamical systems. This approach allows fewer sampling steps with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of generative models based on Gaussian noise for autoregressive predictions in physical systems by exploring the use of stochastic interpolants.

Method: The study benchmarks generative models across various physical domains, focusing on the use of stochastic interpolants to create a stochastic process between consecutive physical states.

Result: Stochastic interpolants are shown to enable fewer sampling steps while improving prediction accuracy, balancing deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and probabilistic calibration.

Conclusion: Stochastic interpolants are presented as a competitive baseline for generative modeling in physical systems, offering insights for improving the accuracy and efficiency of current methods.

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

*Lionel Blondé,Joao A. Candido Ramos,Alexandros Kalousis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), an efficient imitation learning method for the low-data regime, addressing optimal transport with adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective imitation learning method for scenarios with very limited expert demonstrations, especially where traditional large-scale or high-capacity models are impractical.

Method: NGT is proposed as an off-policy method that frames imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial training, requiring no pretraining, specialized architectures, and incorporating uncertainty estimation.

Result: NGT shows strong performance even in challenging continuous control tasks (e.g., high-dimensional Humanoid) and succeeds in ultra-low data settings with as few as 20 transitions.

Conclusion: NGT is simple, efficient, and suitable for low-data imitation learning, offering a practical solution for scarce expert demonstrations without relying on heavy resources.

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

### [509] [Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26594)
*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL) to improve vision-language models for visual mathematical reasoning by minimizing clarification requests and enhancing initial visual captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often create an interface mismatch with reasoning systems by failing to provide detailed textual information needed for mathematical reasoning.

Method: AC-RL uses reinforcement learning to train vision models by penalizing clarification requirements. This approach encourages models to produce comprehensive captions during initial attempts without relying on explicit annotations.

Result: AC-RL improves accuracy by 4.4 points across seven benchmarks and can reduce clarification requests by up to 39%.

Conclusion: Interaction-based learning with implicit supervision can effectively bridge the gap between vision-language models and reasoning systems, overcoming the need for labor-intensive annotations.

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes AttnRL, a novel Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) framework that achieves higher training efficiency and performance for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs) by identifying key reasoning steps and incorporating adaptive sampling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PSRL methods improve reasoning in Large Language Models but suffer from inefficient exploration in terms of branching positions and sampling.

Method: The authors introduced AttnRL, which branches from positions with high attention scores and uses an adaptive sampling strategy based on problem difficulty and historical batch size. They also designed a one-step off-policy training pipeline for efficient PSRL.

Result: The proposed AttnRL method consistently outperformed existing approaches across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, delivering better performance and increased training efficiency.

Conclusion: AttnRL offers a more effective PSRL framework, improving exploration and adaptive training strategies for reasoning models, demonstrating its superiority in empirical evaluations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage alignment strategy for improving robustness and accuracy in large-scale EEG foundation models via NeuroTTT, a self-supervised fine-tuning approach, and test-time training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing generalizable BCI applications with EEG foundation models is hindered by misalignment in pretraining and downstream tasks, as well as cross-subject distribution shifts.

Method: A two-stage strategy is introduced: (1) NeuroTTT, a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning to align EEG latent features, and (2) test-time training using prediction entropy minimization for real-time model calibration.

Result: The proposed strategy enhances robustness and achieves state-of-the-art performance in EEG tasks like imagined speech, stress detection, and motor imagery, outperforming traditional fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Unifying self-supervised domain alignment and test-time training significantly boosts the performance of large-scale EEG models, making them more robust and applicable across diverse BCI tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Attribution-Guided Decoding (AGD), a decoding strategy for improving the reliability and outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoding and control methods for LLMs often struggle to maintain both adherence to instructions and output quality, prompting a need for improvement in these aspects.

Method: Attribution-Guided Decoding (AGD) identifies high-probability output tokens and selects those with the highest attribution to a user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). An adaptive, entropy-based variant is also proposed for dynamic application.

Result: AGD improves instruction adherence rates (e.g., up to 79.1% with Llama 3.1) and reduces hallucinations, enhancing factual accuracy in knowledge-intensive tasks using internal or contextual sources.

Conclusion: AGD offers a flexible and interpretable solution for boosting the reliability and factual accuracy of LLM outputs across diverse tasks, demonstrating its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on single-problem optimization by reviewing strategies for selecting heuristics across multiple attempts, presenting a unified framework and taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners in optimization often prioritize solving one specific problem efficiently using multiple heuristic approaches. Current research lacks a unified review focusing exclusively on sequential selection strategies for such scenarios.

Method: The authors systematically reviewed strategies from fields like algorithm selection, parameter tuning, multi-start, and resource allocation, presenting them in a common terminology and framework.

Result: The work provides a unified perspective and a taxonomy for organizing and classifying heuristic optimization strategies focused on single-problem scenarios.

Conclusion: This paper bridges gaps by integrating diverse heuristic strategies under a unified framework, fostering deeper understanding and enhancing practical optimization efficiency.

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB) framework to address theoretical ambiguities and estimation challenges in the original IB principle, demonstrating improved generalization and interpretability in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original IB principle has unresolved ambiguities and difficulties in accurate estimation, limiting its practical applicability in understanding neural networks.

Method: The authors reformulate the Information Bottleneck principle using a synergy-based perspective, leveraging interaction information (II) to create the Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB) framework, which is more computable and aligns better with theoretical expectations.

Result: The GIB framework exhibits consistent compression phases across diverse architectures, including those where the original IB fails, and shows better alignment with interpretability and adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: The GIB framework enhances the Information Bottleneck principle by addressing its theoretical and practical limitations, offering improved insights into neural network dynamics and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

Result: FedMuon successfully converges and surpasses state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Conclusion: FedMuon mitigates Muon’s limitations, proving effective and superior in federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

### [516] [Memory-Driven Self-Improvement for Decision Making with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26340)
*Xue Yan,Zijing Ou,Mengyue Yang,Yan Song,Haifeng Zhang,Yingzhen Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a memory-driven framework for improving large language models (LLMs) in sequential decision-making tasks by combining general knowledge with task-specific experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting LLMs for specific sequential decision-making tasks, where general knowledge and limited task-specific data are insufficient.

Method: The framework integrates LLM general prior knowledge with a compact memory of past interactions and Q-values, enabling iterative self-improvement through refining priors and enriching memory.

Result: The memory-driven approach achieves significant gains, with over 40% improvement on in-distribution tasks and over 75% improvement on unseen tasks in ALFWorld, surpassing traditional RL and LLM baselines.

Conclusion: The memory-driven self-improvement successfully enables LLMs to adapt to domain-specific sequential decision-making tasks, demonstrating robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

*Joshua Sebastian,Karma Tobden,KMA Solaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an openly accessible benchmark for emergency triage prediction using large language models to preprocess the MIMIC-IV-ED database, aiding in accurate patient deterioration prediction and democratizing clinical AI research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency triage scenarios require rapid and accurate identification of patients in critical need, but existing research is hindered due to the complexity and inaccessibility of usable benchmarks.

Method: The authors use LLMs to preprocess and construct a triage benchmark from MIMIC-IV-ED, defining two regimes for prediction and leveraging interpretability analyses such as SHAP with baseline models.

Result: The benchmark enables accurate deterioration prediction in hospital-rich and MCI-like field scenarios, highlights predictive performance gaps, and identifies features most critical for triage.

Conclusion: The paper democratizes clinical AI research by making triage prediction more reproducible and accessible, addressing technical barriers in transforming raw clinical data into usable benchmarks.

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

### [518] [Data-to-Energy Stochastic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26364)
*Kirill Tamogashev,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an innovative algorithm for the Schrödinger bridge problem, enabling the modelling of stochastic dynamics without requiring sample data, using an adaptation of iterative proportional fitting (IPF) and reinforcement learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing Schrödinger bridge algorithms which require sample data from both distributions, the authors aim to develop a method applicable to cases with only unnormalized densities.

Method: The method generalizes the iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to a data-free scenario, inspired by advancements in off-policy reinforcement learning, and trains using diffusion samplers.

Result: The proposed algorithm successfully learns transports between multimodal distributions. Additionally, existing Schrödinger bridge methods are enhanced by incorporating a fixed time discretization scheme to learn diffusion coefficients.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel solution for data-free Schrödinger bridge problems and broadens its applications, such as sampling posterior distributions of generative models for data-free image-to-image translation.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for small molecule generation and optimization, presenting improvements in quality, diversity, and optimization tasks. It also provides open-source tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a generative model that enhances the capability for small molecule generation, particularly focusing on quality-diversity trade-offs, fragment constraints, and better performance in optimization tasks like property enhancement and lead discovery.

Method: The authors propose InVirtuoGen, which is a discrete flow generative model. It shifts the paradigm from sequence completion to sequence refinement, allowing predictions across all sequence positions during training. A hybrid strategy integrates a genetic algorithm with Proximal Property Optimization to improve property and lead optimization tasks.

Result: InVirtuoGen demonstrates superior performance on quality-diversity metrics compared to previous models, sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark, and achieves higher docking scores in lead optimization tasks.

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen represents a highly versatile and efficient generative model for drug discovery workflows. Its success across multiple benchmarks and the release of open-source tools establishes a strong foundation for future research and practical applications in this domain.

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

### [520] [Ascent Fails to Forget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26427)
*Ioannis Mavrothalassitis,Pol Puigdemont,Noam Itzhak Levi,Volkan Cevher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient ascent-based methods for machine unlearning often fail due to statistical dependence between forget and retain data sets, even when only exhibiting simple correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why machine unlearning methods cannot independently manipulate forget and retain data sets, despite widespread assumptions.

Method: The paper provides theoretical analysis, empirical experiments (including toy examples and experiments on neural networks), and examines logistic regression-based cases to identify failures caused by inter-set dependence.

Result: Unlearning methods based on gradient ascent frequently converge to suboptimal solutions, failing to replicate retrained models or even performing worse than original models due to statistical dependence.

Conclusion: Statistical dependencies within data sets undermine the efficacy of ascent-based unlearning approaches, necessitating new paradigms or methods to address this problem.

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

### [521] [AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26432)
*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces AdaBlock-dLLM, an adaptive block sizing approach for diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to improve decoding performance by addressing limitations of fixed block size methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) offer parallel decoding advantages, but conventional blockwise semi-autoregressive methods suffer from late decoding overhead and premature errors due to fixed block sizes.

Method: The authors conduct statistical analysis of token confidence dynamics during decoding to identify the volatility band (VB) region and propose AdaBlock-dLLM, a runtime scheduler that adjusts block sizes based on semantic steps.

Result: AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement across benchmarks while maintaining the same throughput budget.

Conclusion: Adaptive block decoding through AdaBlock-dLLM improves accuracy, speeds, and suggests avenues for training strategies, offering a significant leap in decoding flexibility for dLLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

*Vincent Grari,Tim Arni,Thibault Laugel,Sylvain Lamprier,James Zou,Marcin Detyniecki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), a model combining decision-tree transparency with the ability to handle unstructured text inputs using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in critical domains need transparent and interpretable decision-making. Existing methods like decision trees lack the ability to process unstructured text, creating a trust gap for applications using large language models.

Method: The authors extend decision-tree methodology through natural-language questions for node splits and apply impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via TextGrad.

Result: ACT demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to traditional prompting strategies on text benchmarks while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: ACT bridges the gap between decision-tree clarity and LLM-based unstructured data processing, advancing trustworthy AI in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

### [523] [Extensions of Robbins-Siegmund Theorem with Applications in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26442)
*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem to allow zero-order terms that are square summable instead of strictly summable, paving the way for improved analysis of stochastic iterative algorithms in applications like reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current Robbins-Siegmund theorem has limitations when applied to reinforcement learning scenarios where the zero-order term is square summable instead of summable, restricting its use in important RL applications.

Method: The authors propose a modification to Robbins-Siegmund theorem by introducing square summable conditions and a mild assumption on stochastic process increments to achieve convergence within bounded sets.

Result: The paper achieves almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates, specifically applied to $Q$-learning with linear function approximation in RL.

Conclusion: The extended theorem significantly enhances the analytical tools for stochastic approximation and reinforcement learning, enabling novel convergence results and rates previously unattainable.

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces fev-bench, a time series forecasting benchmark with 100 tasks across seven domains, and its companion Python library, fev, designed for reproducibility and better evaluation rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting benchmarks lack domain coverage, overlook tasks with covariates, and lack rigorous statistical evaluation methods, making it hard to determine true performance improvements.

Method: The authors propose fev-bench, a benchmark with 100 tasks (including 46 with covariates) and fev, a Python library that focuses on reproducibility. They use bootstrapped confidence intervals to evaluate models based on win rates and skill scores.

Result: They demonstrate fev-bench using various pretrained, statistical, and baseline models, showcasing its ability to generate meaningful performance insights.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of principled evaluation in forecasting and suggests future directions to enhance model benchmarking further.

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiVeQ, a method for vector quantization in deep models that allows gradient flow during training by approximating quantization distortion with an error vector. Another variant, SF-DiVeQ, minimizes error further through a space-filling approach, achieving better reconstruction and sample quality across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard assignments in vector quantization hinder gradient flow, making end-to-end training challenging. There is a need for a method that retains the benefits of quantization while enabling smooth gradients.

Method: The authors propose DiVeQ, which introduces an error vector to mimic quantization distortion, and SF-DiVeQ, which uses a space-filling curve among codewords to reduce quantization error. These methods allow end-to-end gradient-based training without auxiliary losses or scheduling.

Result: DiVeQ and SF-DiVeQ demonstrated improved reconstruction and sample quality in VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation across various datasets when compared to other quantization techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer an efficient way to enable gradient flow in vector quantization, overcoming a key limitation and improving performance in compression and generation tasks.

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to make equivariant neural networks more computationally efficient while preserving their properties, and introduces a tool for easy integration into existing networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equivariant neural networks have strong potential in molecular and geometric data analysis but are resource-intensive due to complex tensor operations.

Method: The framework shifts tensor operations to a local canonicalization approach, resulting in improved runtime efficiency and maintained equivariance. It also explores different representations and introduces the tensor_frames package for integration.

Result: The framework achieves significant runtime improvements and maintains predictive accuracy while systematically comparing representation trade-offs.

Conclusion: Local canonicalization is a promising solution for creating efficient equivariant neural networks, and the tensor_frames tool simplifies this integration within message passing neural networks.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

*Xi Wang,James McInerney,Lequn Wang,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method (Entropy After </Think>, EAT) to detect and prevent overthinking in large reasoning models, enabling adaptive compute allocation and reduced inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the inefficiency of large reasoning models that tend to overthink, producing unnecessary computation beyond the point of correct solutions.

Method: Introduce and utilize Entropy After </Think> (EAT), a signal based on token entropy stabilization to decide when reasoning should stop early. Employ token trajectory monitoring and exponential moving average variance thresholding.

Result: Using EAT on datasets like MATH500 and AIME2025 reduces token usage by 13-21% while maintaining accuracy, and it also works effectively in black box setups using proxy models.

Conclusion: EAT provides a practical and effective tool for reducing token waste and improving efficiency in reasoning models without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

*Seohyun Lee,Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAP (Two-Stage Adaptive Personalization), a novel method for personalized federated learning that addresses heterogeneous client settings, including differences in tasks, data, and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the personalization capabilities of federated learning, particularly for foundation models dealing with multi-task and multi-modal settings, which are often heterogeneous across clients.

Method: TAP operates in two stages: mismatched model architecture replacement operations tailored to individual client needs and post-federated learning knowledge distillation for preserving general knowledge while promoting personalization.

Result: Experimental findings confirm TAP’s effectiveness across diverse datasets and tasks, outperforming various baseline methods. Additionally, the paper provides the first convergence analysis of modality-task pair server architecture.

Conclusion: TAP not only improves personalized federated learning under heterogeneous settings but also unveils key insights about model convergence and scalability. The implementation is open-source for reproducibility.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning-based approach to retrofit power grids for defense against instability attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing reliance on critical infrastructure like the power grid makes it a prime target for cyberattacks, emphasizing the need to develop protections, particularly against instability attacks.

Method: The authors employed a supervised machine learning model combined with modified Prony analysis (MPA) to detect instability attacks and trigger defense mechanisms.

Result: Using the IEEE 14 Bus System and Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, the paper provides proof of concept to demonstrate MPA's effectiveness in identifying instability attacks.

Conclusion: The study validates data-driven ML techniques as cost-effective methods to enhance power grid resilience against cyberattacks, specifically instability attacks.

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Motivation: To develop a method that enhances the interpretability of neural networks by quantitatively assessing similarity between data points in relation to the network.

Method: The authors propose the loss kernel, computed as the covariance matrix of per-sample losses over low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations, and validate it on synthetic and real-world tasks.

Result: The method successfully separates inputs by task in a synthetic multitask problem and aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy when applied to Inception-v1 on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The loss kernel is a practical and theoretically sound technique for neural network interpretability and data attribution.

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

### [531] [Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26625)
*Junlin Han,Shengbang Tong,David Fan,Yufan Ren,Koustuv Sinha,Philip Torr,Filippos Kokkinos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discovers and examines latent visual capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on text, identifying distinct visual priors that enable various vision tasks even without direct image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and enhancing the visual capabilities of LLMs derived from textual data to advance multimodal learning systems.

Method: The study included over 100 controlled experiments, analyzing LLM training and fine-tuning workflows while introducing the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench) for evaluation.

Result: Revealed that reasoning priors predominantly develop from reasoning-centric textual data and persist across vision tasks, while perception priors depend on broad corpora and vision encoder setups.

Conclusion: Visual priors can be deliberately cultivated during language pre-training to create improved multimodal LLMs, leveraging insights into reasoning and perception processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bayesian Influence Functions (BIF), a Hessian-free method designed to address challenges in applying classical influence functions to neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks face difficulties with classical influence functions due to issues like non-invertible Hessians and high-dimensional parameter spaces, necessitating more scalable and accurate alternatives.

Method: The authors replace Hessian inversion with stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling to estimate loss landscape statistics, allowing for capturing higher-order parameter interactions.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting retraining experiments for neural networks.

Conclusion: By introducing this Hessian-free approach, the work offers a scalable and effective solution for influence estimation in neural networks, especially those with extensive parameter spaces.

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Panama is an active learning framework designed to efficiently train parametric guitar amp models using a combination of LSTM and WaveNet-like architectures. The system uses a gradient-based optimization strategy to select minimal yet informative datapoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of creating virtual guitar amps with high perceptual audio quality while minimizing the amount of required training data.

Method: An active learning framework called Panama is presented, utilizing ensemble-based gradient optimization to identify the most informative data points for training an LSTM and WaveNet-like architecture for guitar amp modeling.

Result: Using only 75 datapoints, Panama achieves perceptual audio quality comparable to NAM, a leading non-parametric open-source amp modeler, as verified by MUSHRA listening tests.

Conclusion: Panama demonstrates that efficient active learning can achieve high-quality virtual guitar amp modeling, requiring significantly fewer training datapoints than conventional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like
architecture. With \model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples
that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA
listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match
the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp
modeler.

*David S. Li,Somdatta Goswami,Qianying Cao,Vivek Oommen,Roland Assi,Jay D. Humphrey,George E. Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses finite element simulations and neural networks to analyze thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) progression by identifying mechanical disruptions like elastic fiber damage. UNet models achieve the highest accuracy, emphasizing the importance of both geometric and mechanical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the variability of mechanical and mechanobiological disruptions in TAAs and identify the factors driving disease progression for personalized treatments.

Method: Synthetic TAAs were generated using finite element simulations from diverse insults. Spatial maps of dilatation and distensibility were derived and used to train neural networks (UNets, Deep Operator Networks, Laplace Neural Operators). Predictions were tested using geometric and combined geometric-mechanical data.

Result: UNet architectures performed the best, and predictive performance improved when combining geometric and mechanical data versus geometric data alone.

Conclusion: Acquiring full-field measurements of both dilatation and distensibility is crucial for understanding TAA progression and developing personalized treatments.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

### [535] [Linking Process to Outcome: Conditional Reward Modeling for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26578)
*Zheng Zhang,Ziwei Shan,Kaitao Song,Yexin Li,Kan Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) to improve reasoning in large language models by addressing limitations in Process Reward Models, such as ambiguous credit assignment and vulnerability to reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models fail to capture inter-step dependencies in reasoning and struggle to align intermediate rewards with the final outcome, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The paper proposes CRM, which conditions rewards at each reasoning step on preceding steps and links them explicitly to the final outcome using probabilistic modeling to address causal relationships and resolve credit assignment issues.

Result: CRM outperforms existing reward models across techniques like Best-of-N sampling, beam search, and reinforcement learning, showing robustness against reward hacking and stable performance improvements.

Conclusion: Conditional Reward Modeling provides a principled framework for enhancing reasoning in large language models by addressing key weaknesses of current approaches and delivering reliable downstream improvements.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

*Alexander Fishkov,Kajetan Schweighofer,Mykyta Ielanskyi,Nikita Kotelevskii,Mohsen Guizani,Maxim Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified uncertainty quantification framework for regression using proper scoring rules, deriving practical methods and demonstrating its application on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable decision-making in safety-critical applications requires quantifying machine learning prediction uncertainty, particularly in regression tasks where existing methods are limited.

Method: A unified framework using proper scoring rules like CRPS, logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores is developed. Closed-form expressions are derived, and measures are computed using model ensembles, decomposing uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components.

Result: The approach recovers widely-used regression uncertainty measures and demonstrates its effectiveness on various synthetic and real-world datasets. It offers guidance on selecting appropriate measures for given scenarios.

Conclusion: The study advances uncertainty quantification in regression, providing a practical and theoretically grounded framework, aiding robust decision-making in critical applications.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method combining parallel and sequential inference to improve reasoning in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by maximizing the utility of inference-time compute through innovative scaling methods.

Method: RSA refines a population of reasoning chains by aggregating subsets iteratively, leveraging intermediate reasoning steps and combining parallel and sequential inference. Additionally, reinforcement learning is utilized to optimize aggregation.

Result: RSA demonstrates significant performance improvements across various reasoning tasks, models, and datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art parallel and sequential methods.

Conclusion: Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA) enables smaller models to rival larger models in reasoning tasks and delivers superior results in diverse benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of scaling inference compute strategically.

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

TL;DR: AccidentBench is a benchmark that evaluates multimodal models' understanding and reasoning in safety-critical scenarios involving vehicles, air, and water. It highlights gaps in models' spatial, temporal, and intent reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for rigorous benchmarks to evaluate multimodal models in safety-critical and dynamic real-world scenarios that require robust reasoning capabilities.

Method: The researchers introduced AccidentBench, a benchmark consisting of 2,000 videos and over 19,000 annotated question-answer pairs. These are categorized by length and difficulty, focusing on traffic accidents and scenarios in air and water that involve spatial and temporal reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art models like Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5 performed poorly, achieving only about 18% accuracy on the most challenging tasks and longer videos, indicating significant limitations.

Conclusion: AccidentBench highlights critical weaknesses in current models' reasoning in real-world contexts. It aims to drive improvements in model robustness and safety through its challenging and comprehensive evaluation system.

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SPATA, a method to analyze ML model robustness without exposing private datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models are vulnerable to data perturbations and adversarial attacks, requiring robustness evaluation before deployment. Confidentiality of datasets necessitates tools for external validation without compromising privacy.

Method: SPATA converts tabular datasets into a domain-independent representation, projecting data into a discrete space while maintaining statistical patterns. This enables robustness evaluation and interpretability without data leakage.

Result: SPATA creates reliable projected datasets that allow analysis of feature impact on ML robustness and generation of interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: SPATA enhances AI trustworthiness by enabling robust evaluation without data privacy risks, promoting transparency in sensitive data environments.

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

*Sankar Vinayak. E. P,Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, enhancing equilibrium propagation's performance for neuromorphic hardware applications, achieving competitive CIFAR-10 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Equilibrium propagation, a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, has been limited in its application to small networks with reduced accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Method: The paper proposes the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, integrating residual connections in Hopfield networks with clipped ReLU activations, to extend layer depth and improve performance.

Result: The Hopfield-Resnet13 model achieves 93.92% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, providing a 3.5% improvement over previous equilibrium propagation-based results and matching Resnet13 performance trained with backpropagation.

Conclusion: The architectural modifications significantly improve equilibrium propagation's scalability and effectiveness, making it a viable alternative to backpropagation for larger and more accurate networks.

Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible
alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient
computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium
states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic
hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been
restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small
architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer.
These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized
feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce
the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip)
connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation
function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of
networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For
example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is
$\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that
provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a novel biologically-inspired large language model that achieves Transformer-like performance with enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of Machine Learning models in generalizing over time, inspired by the powerful properties of scale-free biological networks such as the brain.

Method: The authors propose BDH, a unique large language model architecture using a neuron interaction network with synaptic plasticity and Hebbian learning. They emphasize sparse, positive activation vectors and incorporate biologically plausible mechanisms.

Result: Empirical tests show BDH rivals GPT-2 in performance on language and translation tasks across model sizes and training data. Additionally, BDH exhibits characteristics such as interpretability and biological plausibility.

Conclusion: BDH introduces a brain-inspired and interpretable architecture with state-of-the-art capabilities in sequence learning, offering a plausible explanation for how human neurons achieve speech and reasoning.

Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as
motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing.
Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful
properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for
Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model
architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$
locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical
foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like
performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space
sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits
a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:
empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at
the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during
inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using
spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses
strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept
while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a
graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model
is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human
neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse
and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks.
Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and
model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

Conclusion: BEV-VLM effectively expands the utility of Vision-Language Models for trajectory planning in autonomous driving by utilizing BEV representations rather than raw images.

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.

Method: The paper presents a video-based reward modeling framework that predicts task stages and fine-grained progress using automated reward labels from natural language annotations. It also introduces RA-BC, which utilizes reward quality to filter and reweight data.

Result: Experiments show that the reward model improves performance in validation and robotic tasks, and RA-BC achieves significantly higher success rates compared to standard behavior cloning.

Conclusion: Reward modeling is critical for scalable, efficient, and robust imitation learning, showing promise for handling complex long-horizon manipulation tasks in real-world robotics applications.

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

### [546] [Parallel Heuristic Search as Inference for Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25402)
*Hanlan Yang,Itamar Mishani,Luca Pivetti,Zachary Kingston,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACHs, a parallel search algorithm for utilizing actor-critic reinforcement learning models in robotic tasks, enhancing task efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous deployment strategies for actor-critic models in reinforcement learning relied mainly on direct policy rollouts, leaving room for improvement in leveraging model components during inference.

Method: PACHs employs a parallel best-first search algorithm that uses actor networks to generate actions and critic networks to estimate cost-to-go values. It utilizes two levels of parallelism: batch processing for actions/costs and distributed graph expansion across threads.

Result: The proposed approach proves effective in various robotic manipulation tasks, including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions like non-prehensile pushing.

Conclusion: Parallelizing actor-critic inference through PACHs markedly improves robotic task performance, suggesting a promising strategy for real-world RL applications.

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

### [547] [CoTaP: Compliant Task Pipeline and Reinforcement Learning of Its Controller with Compliance Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25443)
*Zewen He,Chenyuan Chen,Dilshod Azizov,Yoshihiko Nakamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Compliant Task Pipeline (CoTaP) to enhance compliance in humanoid robot locomotion control using a learning-based approach and model-based compliance control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve challenges in achieving appropriate compliance for humanoid robots interacting with real environments due to the lack of force data in human motion datasets and position-based learning approaches.

Method: A two-stage reinforcement learning framework is introduced, training a base policy with a position-based controller followed by policy distillation. Adjustable task-space compliance is incorporated via compliance modulation in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold.

Result: The proposed strategy was validated in simulation, demonstrating feasibility and effective responses to external disturbances under adjustable compliance.

Conclusion: Integrating compliance modulation into learning-based control improves stability and interaction capabilities of humanoid robots, showcasing the potential for controlling compliance effectively.

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

TL;DR: The paper presents an online mapping system designed for real-world autonomous driving, utilizing campus-specific data to generate and update HD maps relevant to dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to simplify the labor-intensive and costly process of creating HD maps for autonomous vehicles, particularly in dynamic environments.

Method: The study employs a campus golf cart platform with front cameras and LiDAR for HD map labeling, integrates a SemVecMap model, and develops a pipeline for continual updates using campus-specific data.

Result: The system produced accurate campus-specific HD map predictions, successfully addressing labeling, model integration, and environmental change updates.

Conclusion: By demonstrating practical effectiveness, the online mapping system proves valuable for real-world autonomous driving scenarios, enabling efficient HD map generation and maintenance.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

*Mohammad Merati,David Castañón*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes ESL, a simple real-time policy for multi-robot task allocation that optimally minimizes queue lengths and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently managing multi-robot systems with stochastic arrivals and switching delays to improve real-time task allocation.

Method: Formulated a discounted-cost Markov decision process and developed the Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL) policy for scheduling optimization.

Result: ESL showed superior performance compared to baseline policies in minimizing holding costs and queue lengths across various scenarios.

Conclusion: ESL's simplicity, robustness, and optimality make it a practical solution for real-time multi-robot scheduling challenges.

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HYPER DRIVE, a system for capturing and calibrating hyperspectral images to distinguish terrain properties like vegetative health and soil moisture using a mobile robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of RGB vision systems in detecting critical intra-class terrain properties such as water content, which influence vehicle traversal.

Method: The authors propose a system architecture for collecting and registering hyperspectral images on a mobile robot and implement reflectance calibration techniques to counter varying illumination conditions.

Result: The system successfully calculates vegetative health indices and soil moisture content from hyperspectral data, showcasing its practical utility.

Conclusion: HYPER DRIVE demonstrates the importance and feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging in mobile robotics for analyzing terrain properties beyond conventional RGB systems.

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content
from a mobile robot platform.

TL;DR: dVLA introduces diffusion-based Vision-Language-Action models capable of combining perception, reasoning, and control for advanced robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the complexity of integrating visual perception, language reasoning, and robotic control into a unified framework for better cross-modal reasoning and generalization.

Method: The method revolves around optimizing these three components under a unified diffusion objective and accelerating inference using prefix attention masking and KV caching.

Result: dVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO benchmark with a 96.4% success rate and successfully performs tasks on a real Franka robot, including multi-step planning challenges.

Conclusion: Unified diffusion-based frameworks hold significant potential for advancing the capabilities and deployment of Vision-Language-Action robotics models in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

*Amelie Minji Kim,Anqi Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical diffusion planner using task-conditioned structured Gaussians for better trajectory planning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of standard diffusion-based trajectory planners that use isotropic Gaussian noise, and to improve task-alignment and feasibility of trajectories.

Method: A hierarchical diffusion model with a structured corruption process based on Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP). Upper hierarchy selects task-conditioned priors, and the lower hierarchy denoises trajectories.

Result: Experiments on Maze2D and KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and enhanced task alignment compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Structuring the corruption process improves trajectory planning by concentrating probability near feasible, smooth, and task-relevant trajectories, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

*Xinda Xue,Junjun Hu,Minghua Luo,Xie Shichao,Jintao Chen,Zixun Xie,Quan Kuichen,Guo Wei,Mu Xu,Zedong Chu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniNav, a unified framework for various navigation tasks, showcasing improvements in real-world deployment and robustness through advanced architectures and training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation models struggle to offer unified solutions for diverse tasks, limiting their success and generalization, underlining the need for a versatile, generalizable approach.

Method: OmniNav employs a fast-slow system architecture, generates continuous-space waypoints, and leverages large-scale, multi-task training datasets for enhanced generalization.

Result: OmniNav achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple navigation benchmarks and demonstrates effective deployment in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: OmniNav highlights practical advances and sets a scalable foundation for a versatile, generalizable, embodied robotic intelligence in navigation.

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve reinforcement learning for vision-language-action models by using action chunks and behavior cloning, achieving high success rates and few steps to success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of reinforcement learning for vision-language-action models faces challenges such as sparse rewards and unstable training.

Method: The method combines action chunks aggregated by proximal policy optimization (PPO) and behavior cloning with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer.

Result: The approach yields a high success rate of 0.93 and an average of 42.17 steps to success in the MetaWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning is a viable method for post-training vision-language-action models and sets a foundation for downstream applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

*Shuaijun Wang,Haoran Zhou,Diyun Xiang,Yangwei You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework for refining in-hand poses of known objects using multi-finger sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in grasp execution, especially pose inaccuracies in long-horizon tasks, by leveraging tactile feedback.

Method: TacRefineNet uses a multi-branch policy network combining tactile signals and proprioception. Training involves simulated data in MuJoCo and fine-tuning with real-world tactile data.

Result: Pretraining on simulated data followed by fine-tuning on real-world tactile information improves performance significantly, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy.

Conclusion: TacRefineNet provides a novel tactile-based solution for precise pose refinement, demonstrating its applicability in real-world scenarios and addressing the 'last-mile' challenge in grasp execution.

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a decoupled framework for improving sim-to-real transfer in robot manipulation by separating the learning of control policies and perception, achieving superior performance with minimal real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent challenges of sim-to-real transfer in robotics, particularly the entanglement of perception and control, which has limited the effectiveness of end-to-end training approaches.

Method: The researchers train control policies in simulations with privileged state information to focus on dynamics, while adapting the perception system at deployment to align real observations with frozen control policies, using only 10-20 real demonstrations.

Result: Experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks show that the method outperforms end-to-end baselines in data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization, handling unseen object scales and positions.

Conclusion: Decoupling perception from control facilitates a more efficient and scalable approach to sim-to-real transfer in robotics, demonstrating the universality of control strategies and emphasizing the domain-specific nature of perception.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based RL policies face training instability due to gradient pathologies caused by multi-step action sampling, similar to issues seen in RNNs.

Method: The paper introduces Flow-G and Flow-T architectures using stable reparameterizations for velocity networks, combined with a SAC-based algorithm leveraging noise-augmented rollouts for training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on continuous control and robotic benchmarks without relying on distillation or surrogate objectives.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures provide stable and effective alternatives, addressing instability issues, and advancing performance in complex RL tasks.

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

*Jing Wang,Weiting Peng,Jing Tang,Zeyu Gong,Xihua Wang,Bo Tao,Li Cheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a method that integrates perception and action learning via a probabilistic latent dynamics model, outperforming existing imitation learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning approaches decouple perception from action and fail to capture their causal and adaptive interplay, which is crucial for more human-like adaptability in behaviors.

Method: The proposed method uses a variational inference-based Gaussian posterior to encode observations. It employs an action-guided stochastic differential equation (SDE) where gradient-based latent updates are driven by the diffusion policy’s noise predictions. A cycle-consistent contrastive loss is also introduced to ensure bidirectional learning and coherence between perception and action.

Result: DP-AG demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: DP-AG advances imitation learning by jointly learning perception and action, effectively bridging the gap between biological adaptability and artificial policy design.

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces REVER, a system that improves robots' ability to carry out long-horizon manipulation tasks from language instructions by using vision-language models fine-tuned with specialized rewards and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of enabling robots to execute long-term manipulation guided by natural language, specifically the lack of suitable training data and dense rewards for planning objectives.

Method: The proposed method involves training RoboFarseer, a vision-language model capable of reasoning spatiotemporally, using data annotated with a reward system based on bipartite matching overlap. The model acts as both a planner and a task verifier.

Result: RoboFarseer achieves equal or better performance than larger proprietary models, improves open-ended planning by over 40%, and increases task success in real-world scenarios by around 60%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that fine-tuning VLMs with specialized rewards and training data can significantly enhance their utility in real-world manipulation tasks. The dataset and model will be open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon

### [560] [State Estimation for Compliant and Morphologically Adaptive Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25945)
*Valentin Yuryev,Max Polzin,Josie Hughes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network-based state estimator for locomotion robots with compliance-related features, tested on the GOAT platform in extreme outdoor terrain, showing enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Locomotion robots with compliance are robust in uncertain scenarios but face challenges in state estimation due to flexible body assumptions and changes from morphing.

Method: A neural network-based estimator analyzes historical data and influences unreliable sensors, trained using motion capture data in a compliance-centric frame.

Result: Estimation accuracy includes 4.2% in shape prediction, and significant velocity and orientation precision; enhanced robot operation with 300% increased travel in motor malfunction scenarios.

Conclusion: The method provides robust state estimation for morphing robots, improving autonomous operation in challenging outdoor settings.

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor
operation.

### [561] [Towards Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction through Embodied Gesture-Driven Control with Woven Tactile Skins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25951)
*ChunPing Lam,Xiangjia Chen,Chenming Wu,Hao Chen,Binzhi Sun,Guoxin Fang,Charlie C. L. Wang,Chengkai Dai,Yeung Yam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a gesture-driven human-robot interaction framework using a capacitance-based tactile skin, achieving high recognition accuracy and improved task efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HRI systems often rely on detached devices, creating interaction gaps. There’s a need for more natural and intuitive interfaces for seamless human-robot collaboration.

Method: The authors developed a woven tactile skin equipped with interlaced conductive threads for dense sensing. They paired this with a convolution-transformer model for gesture recognition.

Result: The system recognized 14 unique touch gestures with near-100% accuracy. Experiments show a 57% reduction in task completion time compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective solution for intuitive embodied HRI, enhancing task efficiency and bridging the divide between human intent and robot action.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

*Peilong Han,Fan Jia,Min Zhang,Yutao Qiu,Hongyao Tang,Yan Zheng,Tiancai Wang,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MUVLA proposes a vision-language-action model tailored for object navigation using semantic map abstractions, achieving robust exploration and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to improve object navigation by structuring spatial and historical information into a unified semantic representation to guide action decisions effectively.

Method: The model integrates current and historical observations along with a semantic map, employs a reward-driven return modeling system, and utilizes a three-stage training pipeline: spatial understanding, imitation, and reward amplification.

Result: Experiments on HM3D and Gibson benchmarks show that MUVLA generalizes well and learns effective exploration behaviors, even from imperfect demonstrations.

Conclusion: MUVLA provides a robust framework for object navigation, leveraging semantic mapping and diverse demonstrations to improve exploration strategies and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action
model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to
unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

*Shengpeng Wang,Yulong Xie,Qing Liao,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces S^3E, a self-supervised state estimator for accurate localization using radar spectra and inertial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar is affordable and reliable, but its limitations like sparse point clouds, ghost points, and poor angular resolution hinder accurate state estimation.

Method: S^3E uses radar signal spectra and inertial data for localization, employing a novel cross-fusion technique to improve spatial structure information.

Result: The method achieved robust and accurate localization without relying on ground truth supervision.

Conclusion: S^3E is the first approach to fuse radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary self-supervised manner for state estimation.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

### [564] [Emotionally Expressive Robots: Implications for Children's Behavior toward Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25986)
*Elisabetta Zibetti,Sureya Waheed Palmer,Rebecca Stower,Salvatore M Anzalone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study investigates how different levels of emotional expressiveness in robots impact children's behavior in a cooperative game. Children aligned with the robot’s emotions, but higher expressiveness did not enhance alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether and how the emotional expressiveness of robots influences children's empathic and social-emotional responses.

Method: A pilot study involving 22 children aged 7-11 and the use of QTRobot in a turn-taking game, testing varying levels of robot expressiveness (body only, face only, body and face) for happiness and sadness.

Result: Children aligned their behavior with the robot's emotional state, but increasing expressiveness did not yield stronger alignment.

Conclusion: The findings suggest robotic emotional expressiveness can influence interactions with children, but its optimal levels and long-term social implications need critical examination.

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

### [565] [On the Conic Complementarity of Planar Contacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25999)
*Yann de Mont-Marin,Louis Montaut,Jean Ponce,Martial Hebert,Justin Carpentier*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework that bridges discrete and continuous contact models in robotics through a new "planar Signorini condition," which connects the Signorini law and the center of pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to unify discrete point-based contact modeling and continuous spatial contact modeling in robotics, addressing inconsistencies and challenges in accurately modeling and controlling contact situations in locomotion and manipulation.

Method: They propose a conic complementarity formulation called the planar Signorini condition that encompasses three physical regimes (sticking, separating, tilting) and extends the classical concept of the center of pressure.

Result: The proposed framework mathematically unifies the punctual Signorini law and continuous contact surface dynamics, resulting in a consistent and computationally efficient model.

Conclusion: This work advances theoretical and practical approaches to contact modeling in robotics, aiding both simulations and optimization/control design for tasks like locomotion and manipulation.

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study explores a novel path-finding problem for multiple agents dealing with both static and movable obstacles, leveraging adaptations of existing algorithms to evaluate performance under challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the unique challenges in logistics and warehouse settings where mobile robots face movable obstacles, a less-studied problem compared to traditional MAPF and single-agent PAMO.

Method: The authors adapt Conflict-Based Search (CBS), Prioritized Planning (PP), and a single-agent PAMO planner (PAMO*) to handle the complexities of M-PAMO, integrating these methods to study their feasibility and efficiency.

Result: Performance tests were conducted with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable obstacles, showing the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundational exploration of M-PAMO, highlighting the challenges posed by movable obstacles and offering insights into algorithmic adaptability for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Agent Path Finding Among Movable Obstacles
(M-PAMO), which seeks collision-free paths for multiple agents from their start
to goal locations among static and movable obstacles. M-PAMO arises in
logistics and warehouses where mobile robots are among unexpected movable
objects. Although Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) and single-agent Path
planning Among Movable Obstacles (PAMO) were both studied, M-PAMO remains
under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

*Tianyi Jin,Melya Boukheddimi,Rohit Kumar,Gabriele Fadini,Frank Kirchner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The EA-CoRL framework combines reinforcement learning and evolutionary strategies to parallelly optimize robot design and control, achieving superior performance results in co-design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional sequential robot design processes by integrating hardware and control co-design to maximize robotic capabilities.

Method: Introduced the EA-CoRL framework with two components: Design Evolution (evolutionary algorithms for hardware exploration) and Policy Continuous Adaptation (task-specific control fine-tuning).

Result: EA-CoRL demonstrated superior outcomes in co-designing actuator gear ratios and control policy for the RH5 humanoid robot performing a chin-up task, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Continuous policy adaptation in parallel co-design processes is critical for optimizing robotic performance and exploring broader design spaces.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Result: Validation showed sensor accuracy above 94%, task success rate of 92%, and communication reliability at 96%, proving system robustness and early detection of abnormal health conditions.

Conclusion: The multi-robot system demonstrates promise as a cost-effective, reliable solution for inpatient care automation and improved patient safety, although limited to simulated environments due to ethical constraints.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,
RF-based communication, and AI-driven decision support. Within a simulated
hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration
to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due
to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead,

temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots
when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery,
while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired
leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured
continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff.
The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF
modules, and a HuskyLens AI camera. Experimental evaluation showed an overall

communication reliability rate, demonstrating system robustness. Furthermore,
the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal
health conditions, highlighting the potential of the system as a cost-effective

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the bottleneck of safe AUV navigation in seaweed farms, crucial for enabling industrial-scale seaweed farming automation.

Method: An SSS-based SLAM framework models kelp farm structural ropes as sequences of individual landmarks, avoiding elongated representations and leveraging their geometric properties.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art solutions in hardware-in-the-loop experiments conducted within a real kelp farm.

Conclusion: This framework offers a practical solution for AUV navigation in seaweed farms, advancing smart seaweed farming. Code and datasets are made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The transition of seaweed farming to an alternative food source on an
industrial scale relies on automating its processes through smart farming,
equivalent to land agriculture. Key to this process are autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) via their capacity to automate crop and structural inspections.
However, the current bottleneck for their deployment is ensuring safe
navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can

*Yizhe Liu,Han Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a terrain-aware LiDAR-Inertial odometry method to improve localization accuracy in unstructured terrains using Radial Basis Functions (RBF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robot odometry often fail to consider terrain geometry, leading to pose drift, especially under abrupt elevation changes.

Method: The framework utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) for terrain approximation, enabling smooth terrain constraints. Adaptive centers and recursive weight updates optimize performance. GPU parallelization improves efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrated enhanced localization accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially in terrains with continuous or abrupt height changes.

Conclusion: The proposed terrain-aware LIO framework effectively mitigates pose drift and achieves real-time performance, offering significant improvements for legged-wheel robots navigating challenging terrains.

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces ISyHand, a low-cost, easy-to-manufacture, highly dexterous robot hand equipped with an innovative articulated-palm design that improves dexterity. It achieves competitive performance against comparable hands in simulated and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for cost-effective yet highly dexterous robotic hands to advance manipulation tasks in robotics, while maintaining practicality and ease of assembly.

Method: The researchers designed the ISyHand using Dynamixel motors, 3D-printed parts, and fasteners. They also used reinforcement learning in simulations to train the hand for cube reorientation tasks and evaluated its performance against comparable robotic hands.

Result: ISyHand demonstrated superior dexterity early in training and outperformed a fixed-palm design of itself in simulation. Its trained policies transferred successfully to real-world cube manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The ISyHand provides an innovative, inexpensive, and practical option for robotic dexterous manipulation, showcasing its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world scenarios with potential application to broader manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores anomaly detection (AD) in robotic manipulation using time series data to improve failure detection across various tasks and control methods. It utilizes autoencoder-based techniques and demonstrates reliable detection in several scenarios, though challenges remain in detecting subtle anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robotic manipulation by identifying out-of-distribution states that cause task failures, thereby improving success rates, reducing risks, and enabling failsafe mechanisms.

Method: Autoencoder-based anomaly detection methods are applied to multimodal time series data from three industrial robot tasks: cabling, screwing, and sanding. The study compares generalization across different control methods and evaluates detection efficiency.

Result: AUROC scores above 0.93 were achieved in detecting failures in cabling and screwing tasks. Severe failures in the sanding task were reliably detected, but subtle failures were missed.

Conclusion: The study validates the use of anomaly detection methods for robust detection in robotic manipulation tasks and highlights the limitations with subtle failure types, suggesting room for improvement in detection sensitivity.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

Motivation: Exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments are challenging for multi-robot systems due to limited inter-robot coordination in traditional greedy approaches.

Method: LLM-MCoX combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning to intelligently assign waypoints based on shared maps and robot states.

Result: LLM-MCoX achieves 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% better search efficiency in large indoor environments with coordinated 6-robot teams.

Conclusion: The framework surpasses traditional methods, enabling efficient exploration and integrating natural language-based object search through LLM capabilities for enhanced human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large

heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural

*Eric R. Damm,Thomas M. Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper tackles the issue of inconsistent obstacle identification by mobile robots and introduces planning methods that integrate multiple world models to generate safer paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robots face challenges in generating safe paths in unknown environments due to inconsistent obstacle mapping, which hinders reliable motion planning.

Method: Three iterations of a planning approach are proposed: PEH (sub-search at divergence points), GEH (deferring sub-search to goal region), and GEGRH (revising the graph based on divergent nodes).

Result: GEGRH demonstrates improved performance by finding lower-cost trajectories and faster planning times compared to other methods, especially in unstructured environments.

Conclusion: GEGRH offers a balanced solution between conservative planning and practical planning times, proving superior over single-hypothesis and other multi-hypothesis methods in realistic field conditions.

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

*Zichao Shen,Chen Gao,Jiaqi Yuan,Tianchen Zhu,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER enhances embodied task planning with adaptive, error-aware mechanisms, outperforming existing methods in success rate and goal completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied task planners are limited by fixed paradigms, lack of action constraints, and being error-agnostic.

Method: Introduces State-Dependency Graph for action modeling and error-adaptive replanning strategies like Error Backtrack, Diagnosis, and Adaptive Action SubTree Generation.

Result: Experiments show SDA-PLANNER excels in success rate and goal completion, especially under various error conditions.

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER is an effective, resilient approach for embodied task planning in dynamically evolving environments.

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

*Mattia Piazza,Mattia Piccinini,Sebastiano Taddei,Francesco Biral,Enrico Bertolazzi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FBGA, a new forward-backward algorithm for computing time-optimal velocity profiles with generic acceleration constraints, achieving high accuracy and significantly faster computation compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computational efficiency and accuracy in robot trajectory planning, especially under complex acceleration constraints, for applications like autonomous racing.

Method: The proposed FBGA algorithm uses forward and backward iterative passes over discretized path segments to optimize velocity profiles while adhering to user-defined acceleration constraints.

Result: FBGA was tested on five racetracks and two vehicle classes, achieving lap times closely matching optimal control baselines (with deviations between 0.11%-0.36%) and demonstrated up to three orders of magnitude faster computations.

Conclusion: FBGA effectively balances high computational speed and accuracy, making it suitable for online multi-query trajectory planning, with validation on diverse scenarios and availability as an open-source implementation in C++.

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

### [577] [Unwinding Rotations Reduces VR Sickness in Nonsimulated Immersive Telepresence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26439)
*Filip Kulisiewicz,Basak Sakcak,Evan G. Center,Juho Kalliokoski,Katherine J. Mimnaugh,Steven M. LaValle,Timo Ojala*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether unwinding rotations of a camera on a robotic arm in immersive telepresence increases comfort and reduces VR sickness compared to coupled rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address VR sickness associated with robot motions in immersive telepresence without compromising user experience or task performance.

Method: A user study (n=36) compared unwinding camera rotations against coupled rotations during a task involving translations and rotations using a real panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm.

Result: Users preferred the unwinding rotations method and reported reduced VR sickness, with no significant drop in task performance.

Conclusion: Unwinding rotations in immersive telepresence improves comfort and reduces VR sickness without detriment to task performance, validating previous findings in a real-world setting.

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task
performance.

*Akshay Jaitly,Devesh K. Jha,Kei Ota,Yuki Shirai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops an efficient method to enforce non-penetration constraints during optimization problems like trajectory planning. It introduces novel differentiable conditions and a technique to approximate non-smooth objects for smooth computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based solutions struggle with the computational complexity of enforcing non-penetration constraints, limiting their utility in planning and control tasks.

Method: The authors propose differentiable conditions with analytic expressions to enforce non-collision constraints and use a semi-algebraic approximation for non-smooth polytopes.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong performance in numerical experiments and offers improvements over recent baseline methods.

Conclusion: The work provides an effective approach to simplify the computational challenges in optimization tasks involving non-collision constraints, making trajectory planning more efficient.

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

*Saad Abdul Ghani,Kameron Lee,Xuesu Xiao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LfH-CP, a self-supervised framework for generating diverse obstacle datasets for motion planning, avoiding costly expert demonstrations through hallucinating critical points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion planning in dynamic environments is constrained by the challenge of generating large, diverse obstacle datasets, given the vast variability in possible trajectories.

Method: The proposed LfH-CP framework hallucinates critical points where obstacles must appear for optimal plans and generates diverse trajectories around these points to avoid collisions.

Result: LfH-CP generates richer and more diverse datasets compared to previous methods, and planners trained on these datasets show higher success rates.

Conclusion: LfH-CP effectively produces varied and useful datasets for motion planning, improving planning performance without relying on expensive expert input or exploration.

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis
approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a
self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on
existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations
or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two
stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to
result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then
procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points
while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such
as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further
introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP
produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines.
Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets
achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.

*Shuoyu Yue,Pengpeng Li,Yang Xu,Kunrui Ze,Xingjian Long,Huazi Cao,Guibin Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a memory-efficient tree map representation and a distributed controller for shape assembly tasks in robot swarms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory demands of image-based representations in robot swarm shape assembly, particularly for high-resolution or 3D shapes.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical tree map representation suitable for 2D and 3D shapes, paired with a behavior-based distributed controller for assignment-free shape assembly.

Result: Achieved 10-100x lower memory usage and 2-3x faster shape entry compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar uniformity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is memory-efficient, faster, and has been validated in both simulations and real-world tests, proving its practicality.

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system using UWB and radar technologies combined with low-cost sensors. The system employs advanced techniques like nonlinear optimization and pose-graph optimization, outperforming existing methods in both simulations and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the limitations of traditional localization methods in robotics, particularly in harsh and cluttered environments, by leveraging underutilized technologies like UWB and radar for enhanced robustness and accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes a system that first uses nonlinear optimization for UWB-based trilateration of UAV position and radar pre-processing for ego-motion estimation. These processed data, along with inter-robot transformations, are integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. The system is implemented on ROS 2 and validated through real-world datasets and simulations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the proposed system's superiority over existing methods, particularly in robustness to noise and its capability in multi-robot scenarios. A custom Gazebo plugin for realistic UWB simulation is also introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed localization system not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but is also easily extensible to SLAM. The public release of the code and data encourages reproducibility and facilitates benchmarking for future research.

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust optimization framework capable of addressing memory usage issues and delivering fast performance for applications like SLAM and bundle adjustment.

Method: The paper introduces Graphite, which leverages GPU acceleration (via CUDA C++) and offers techniques like in-place optimization, support for varying precision, and dynamically computed Jacobians to optimize graph-based problems.

Result: Graphite is evaluated on bundle adjustment problems and stereo-inertial SLAM datasets, delivering competitive performance compared to specialized solvers like MegBA and achieving up to 59x speed ups over CPU baselines.

Conclusion: Graphite enhances large-scale optimization tasks by bridging generality and performance, applicable on diverse devices from desktops to resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We present Graphite, a GPU-accelerated nonlinear graph optimization
framework. It provides a CUDA C++ interface to enable the sharing of code
between a realtime application, such as a SLAM system, and its optimization
tasks. The framework supports techniques to reduce memory usage, including
in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and
mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite
on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar
performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while
maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global
visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM
datasets, and observe speed ups of up to 59x compared to a CPU baseline. Our
results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

*Lujie Yang,Xiaoyu Huang,Zhen Wu,Angjoo Kanazawa,Pieter Abbeel,Carmelo Sferrazza,C. Karen Liu,Rocky Duan,Guanya Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents OmniRetarget, a data generation engine addressing gaps in retargeting human motions to humanoid robots, improving interaction preservation and enabling efficient training for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for retargeting human motions to humanoid robots fail to account for the embodiment gap, leading to unrealistic artifacts and neglecting human-object/environment interactions.

Method: The proposed OmniRetarget minimizes deformation between human and robot meshes, ensures kinematic constraints, and preserves task-relevant interactions for data augmentation and trajectory generation.

Result: OmniRetarget produces over 8 hours of high-quality motion data, outperforming baselines in kinematic and contact preservation, facilitating RL policies for advanced robot skills.

Conclusion: OmniRetarget enhances retargeting pipelines by preserving interactions and generating feasible trajectories, enabling robots to efficiently perform complex tasks with minimal reward terms and simple training setups.

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multisensory language-action (MLA) model to improve actions in robotics using multimodal data and future state prediction, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in vision-language-action models which lack a proper understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information vital for intricate, contact-rich tasks.

Method: The proposed MLA model aligns multimodal inputs (2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile data) using the large language model itself as a perception module and includes a future multisensory generation post-training strategy to reason about physical dynamics.

Result: The MLA model outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 12% in 2D and 24% in 3D tasks for real-world complex environments, with better generalization to unseen conditions.

Conclusion: The MLA model represents a significant advancement in leveraging multisensory data for robotic manipulation, achieving superior real-world task performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APRIL integrates an LLM with Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to enhance API synthesis. Tested on real-world scientific libraries, it outperforms unfine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: API composition is challenging due to vast search spaces, hand-crafted specifications, and issues like hallucination in LLMs, which produce incorrect code.

Method: APRIL combines a frozen LLM with APO for refining prompts and RLVR for fine-tuning functional correctness, forming a synthesis pipeline.

Result: In evaluations on 81 real-world APIs from scientific Python libraries, APRIL significantly outperformed instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs guided by expert prompts.

Conclusion: Integrating APO and RLVR offers a scalable solution for API synthesis in extensive libraries, improving accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from
large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional
component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted
specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations
from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date
contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present
APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):
APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the
policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis
pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python
libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs
guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These
results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path
for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

productivity. This paper introduces WARP (Web-Augmented Real-time Program
Repairer), a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and
dynamic web-augmented synthesis for real-time resolution of these errors. WARP
actively monitors developer terminals, intelligently detects compilation
errors, and synergistically combines the understanding of a fine-tuned Code-LLM
with relevant solutions, explanations, and code snippets retrieved from
up-to-date web sources like developer forums and official documentation.

Result: RagVerus triples proof pass rates on existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets and achieves a 27% relative improvement on the newly introduced RVBench.

Conclusion: The proposed RVBench and RagVerus framework provide a scalable and efficient solution for repository-level software verification, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest great promises in

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BUILD-BENCH, a benchmark for building and compiling diverse OSS projects, and proposes OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an LLM-based agent achieving state-of-the-art results on the benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the challenge of automatically compiling OSS projects, as existing methods depend on static rules and selective evaluation, which fail under realistic and diverse OSS environments.

Method: The method involves creating BUILD-BENCH, a diverse and realistic OSS benchmark, and developing OSS-BUILD-AGENT with an enhanced instruction retrieval module for improved compilation adaptability.

Result: The paper demonstrates that OSS-BUILD-AGENT achieves state-of-the-art results on the BUILD-BENCH benchmark and provides insights into effective compilation method design.

Conclusion: BUILD-BENCH reflects realistic compilation challenges and OSS-BUILD-AGENT offers significant advancements, aiming to inspire innovation in related fields like software development and security.

Abstract: Automatically compiling open-source software (OSS) projects is a vital,
labor-intensive, and complex task, which makes it a good challenge for LLM
Agents. Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which
cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment
setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective
evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the
realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions
are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even
require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more
challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more
diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a
strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with
enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art
performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS
characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different
compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task,
offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on
BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as
a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur
innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields
of software development and software security.

*Haoyang Wu,Xinxin Zhang,Lailai Zhu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM-PDEveloper is a zero-shot, multi-agent framework leveraging large language models to automate the development of partial differential equation (PDE) solvers and libraries, transforming mathematical descriptions into functional code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) not only for text-processing tasks but also for generating numerical libraries and solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), targeting a gap in code automation for secondary developers.

Method: The paper introduces LLM-PDEveloper, a zero-shot, multi-agent framework that translates mathematical and algorithmic descriptions into source code, enabling code generation and modifications for PDE solvers. The framework operates end-to-end by incrementally expanding and improving the codebase.

Result: The framework was tested on three tasks: (1) developing a new PDE solver, (2) adding new boundary conditions to an existing PDE solver, and (3) modifying an existing solver to include additional terms, demonstrating moderate success. Syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed, with fixes proposed, and mechanisms for semantic errors are explored.

Conclusion: LLM-PDEveloper showcases the potential of LLMs to automate and continuously enhance PDE codebase development, albeit with some syntactic and semantic limitations. The findings offer insights for improving future iterations and broader applications.

Abstract: Foundation models -- large language models (LLMs) in particular -- have
become ubiquitous, shaping daily life and driving breakthroughs across science,
engineering, and technology. Harnessing their broad cross-domain knowledge,
text-processing, and reasoning abilities for software development, e.g.,
numerical libraries for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), is
therefore attracting growing interest. Yet existing studies mainly automate
case setup and execution for end users. We introduce LLM-PDEveloper, a
zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE
libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers. By translating
mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code,
LLM-PDEveloper generates new solvers/modules and adapts existing ones. This
end-to-end math-to-code approach enables a self-augmenting pipeline that
continuously expands the codebase of a library, extends its capacities, and
broadens its scope. We demonstrate LLM-PDEveloper on three tasks: 1) build a
solver for a new PDE, 2) implement new BCs for a given PDE, and 3) modify an
existing solver to incorporate additional terms, achieving moderate success
rates. Failures due to syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed and we
propose effective fixes. We also identify the mechanisms underlying certain
semantic errors, guiding future research.

TL;DR: The paper investigates monitoring strategies for ML systems to detect issues like performance decline, latency, and security breaches. It gathers insights from 91 ML practitioners to highlight challenges and areas for improvement in tool design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of unexpected or dangerous behavior in ML systems within production environments and provide insights for improving monitoring practices to prevent organizational damage.

Method: A global survey of 91 ML practitioners was conducted, supported by qualitative and quantitative analyses, to explore monitoring practices, challenges, and improvement opportunities.

Result: Practitioners face frequent challenges such as declining model performance, latency issues, and security threats in ML monitoring. Most prefer automation but are hindered by tool complexity and manual efforts. Desired enhancements include automated monitor setups, better performance monitoring support, and resolution recommendations.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for developing more efficient, user-friendly, and automated ML monitoring tools that address practitioners' challenges and align with industrial needs.

Abstract: Given the inherent non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML) systems,
their behavior in production environments can lead to unforeseen and
potentially dangerous outcomes. For a timely detection of unwanted behavior and
to prevent organizations from financial and reputational damage, monitoring
these systems is essential. This paper explores the strategies, challenges, and
improvement opportunities for monitoring ML systems from the practitioners
perspective. We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect
diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to
complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses,
focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation
practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools.
Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues
related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security
violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased
efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack
of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial
setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and
challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert
thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload,
strains resources, and causes alert fatigue. The desired improvements from the
practitioners perspective are: automated generation and deployment of monitors,
improved support for performance and fairness monitoring, and recommendations
for resolving runtime issues. These insights offer valuable guidance for the
future development of ML monitoring tools that are better aligned with
practitioners needs.

*Mohammad Rifat Arefin,Shanto Rahman,Christoph Csallner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NatGI improves black-box grammar inference using LLM-guided techniques, achieving higher accuracy and interpretability compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grammar inference tools struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy for large and complex languages.

Method: NatGI incorporates bracket-guided exploration, LLM-driven naming and bubble generation, and hierarchical delta debugging to simplify and enhance grammar inference.

Result: The framework achieves an average F1 score of 0.57, outperforming baselines like TreeVada by 25 percentage points. It also generates grammars with better interpretability.

Conclusion: NatGI enables developers and researchers to obtain more accurate and human-intuitive grammars for program analysis and related tasks.

Abstract: Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis,
reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada,
and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large,
complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference
framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key
innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation
and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for
systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic
cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while
LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising
merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the
grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI
on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones
such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms
strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score
of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing
baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars
perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches.
Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules
with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more
closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can
achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and
reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CanItEdit, a pipeline using multiple LLMs to create high-quality, realistic code-edit datasets, addressing limitations in existing noisy commit-based datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve code editing by reducing noise, increasing diversity, and ensuring style relevance in datasets used for training models.

Method: CanItEdit synthesizes code-edit triplets with lazy and descriptive instructions while filtering for quality and variety. It generates a curated dataset (OCEDataFT) for further training.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the OCEDataFT dataset showed significant performance improvements, narrowing the performance gap with closed-source systems like GPT-4.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the effectiveness of using open-source pipelines and curated datasets to significantly enhance code-editing model capabilities without relying on proprietary tools or manual annotations.

Abstract: Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers
to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while
keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However,
commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack
diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To
address this, we introduce CanItEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages
multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces
both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and
applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and
variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K
samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to
significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1
improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models
achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4
to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MULocBench, a dataset designed to improve benchmarks in issue localization for software maintenance, emphasizing greater diversity and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in existing issue localization benchmarks which focus narrowly on pull-request issues and code files, ignoring other evidence and file types.

Method: The authors assembled a dataset, MULocBench, of 1,100 issues from 46 popular Python projects on GitHub, and evaluated state-of-the-art localization methods and LLM-based prompting strategies using this benchmark.

Result: The evaluation shows that state-of-the-art methods have significant limitations, with performance metrics like Acc@5 and F1 remaining below 40%.

Conclusion: MULocBench highlights the complexity and challenges of realistic issue resolution, providing a valuable dataset for advancing research in project localization.

Abstract: Accurate project localization (e.g., files and functions) for issue
resolution is a critical first step in software maintenance. However, existing
benchmarks for issue localization, such as SWE-Bench and LocBench, are limited.
They focus predominantly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring
other evidence and non-code files such as commits, comments, configurations,
and documentation. To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a
comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects.
Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in
issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more
realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the
performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based
prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current
techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain
below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic,
multi-faceted issue resolution. To enable future research on project
localization for issue resolution, we publicly release MULocBench at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/somethingone/MULocBench.

*Xunzhu Tang,Iyiola Emmanuel Olatunji,Tiezhu Sun,Jacques Klein,Tegawende F. Bissyande*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiCoD, a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the selection of solutions generated by Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting for tasks requiring structured reasoning in code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency and variance in solution quality associated with Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting, as well as the verbosity issues in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for reasoning tasks requiring correctness in code generation.

Method: MultiCoD employs a reinforcement learning framework that selects the best candidate solution from CoD-generated reasoning styles using a contextual bandit model. It optimizes interpretable features like code complexity, reasoning structure, and clarity, guided by a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency, and clarity.

Result: Experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks such as MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and Defects4J show that MultiCoD surpasses or matches baseline methods in performance while reducing user costs and token inefficiency by over 50%.

Conclusion: MultiCoD proves to be a scalable and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in real-world structured reasoning tasks, improving response quality and efficiency.

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate surface-level fluency in code generation but struggle with
structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning through intermediate steps,
it suffers from verbosity and inefficiency. Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting
offers more concise reasoning, but the stochastic nature of LLMs produces
varying solution quality, making optimal selection challenging. We propose
\multicod, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the most
promising candidate from CoD-generated solutions. Our approach uses
strategy-guided prompting to encourage diverse reasoning styles and models
solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. The framework optimizes
interpretable features including code complexity, reasoning structure, and
strategic metadata through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency,
and clarity. Experiments on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and
Defects4J show \multicod~outperforms and in some cases, on par with standard
prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines while achieving cost and token efficiency
from the user's perspective through a multi-candidate design that charges only
for the selected output, reducing user billing by over 50\% and improving LLM
response quality, making \multicod~more sustainable and scalable for real-world
deployment. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiCoD.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations on the code generation performance of LLMs, proposing a method to improve both their interpretability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on LLMs for code generation brings productivity benefits but raises concerns over suboptimal and insecure code generation, necessitating a better understanding of how to enhance model performance and interpretability.

Method: The authors focus on selecting high-quality ICL demonstrations using AST-based analysis of code outputs from the MBPP test set, analyzing their effect on code interpreter regions and LLM performance.

Result: High-quality ICL demonstrations enhanced LLM performance on the pass@10 metric and improved code interpretability, while poorly chosen demonstrations degraded performance compared to the base model.

Conclusion: Efficient sampling of ICL demonstrations is crucial for improving the performance and interpretability of code-generation tasks in LLMs, reinforcing the importance of structured demonstration selection strategies.

Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely
adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering,
speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code
generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and
Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and
recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the
growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although
these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing
reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of
suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically
sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model
performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using
AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of
code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show
that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret
but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric.
Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on
the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach
highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can
affect the performance of the model on any given task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RANGER is a repository-level code retrieval agent handling both code entity queries and natural language queries, leveraging a knowledge graph and dual-stage retrieval system for various software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of existing works which primarily focus on code entity queries, by introducing a system capable of processing both specific code-related and general natural language queries.

Method: Develop a comprehensive knowledge graph representing repository dependencies at granular levels; design a dual-stage retrieval pipeline using Cypher lookups for entity queries and graph exploration for natural language queries.

Result: RANGER excels in several ASE benchmarks, outperforming baselines in code search, QA, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code completion tasks.

Conclusion: RANGER effectively bridges the gap between code and natural language, providing superior retrieval capabilities in diverse ASE tasks over conventional baseline methods.

Abstract: General-purpose automated software engineering (ASE) includes tasks such as
code completion, retrieval, repair, QA, and summarization. These tasks require
a code retrieval system that can handle specific queries about code entities,
or code entity queries (for example, locating a specific class or retrieving
the dependencies of a function), as well as general queries without explicit
code entities, or natural language queries (for example, describing a task and
retrieving the corresponding code). We present RANGER, a repository-level code
retrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent
works that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a
tool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,
capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,
and augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the
gap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph
through a dual-stage retrieval pipeline. Entity-based queries are answered
through fast Cypher lookups, while natural language queries are handled by
MCTS-guided graph exploration. We evaluate RANGER across four diverse
benchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question
answering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code
completion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that
use embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B. On RepoBench, it achieves
superior cross-file dependency retrieval over baselines, and on CrossCodeEval,
pairing RANGER with BM25 delivers the highest exact match rate in code
completion compared to other RAG methods.

Motivation: To address the complexity and time demands of developing full-stack web applications and limitations in current automated solutions which only focus on front-end tasks.

Method: TDDev utilizes test-driven development (TDD) with LLM-agent capabilities to automatically derive test cases, generate code, simulate interactions, and improve implementations iteratively.

Result: TDDev improved overall accuracy by 14.4% compared to leading baselines, showcasing its ability to deliver reliable, high-quality applications across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: TDDev successfully automates end-to-end full-stack web application development, overcoming major challenges and eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Abstract: Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive,
demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although
recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated
webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to
front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this
work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled
LLM-agent framework for end-to-end full-stack web application generation. Given
a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives
executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user
interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements
are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation,
including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among
multiple files, and the need for both functional correctness and visual
fidelity. Through extensive experiments on diverse application scenarios, TDDev
achieves a 14.4% improvement on overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality
web applications without requiring manual intervention.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSCHECKER, an LLM-based tool for detecting and fixing API misuses in data science libraries. It uses information such as API directives and data-specific details for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: API misuse in data science libraries is challenging to detect due to their data-centric focus, thus necessitating advanced tools for better detection and fixing.

Method: The method involves experimenting with various prompts on three large language models (LLMs) to detect and fix API misuses and developing an adaptive function-calling system to simulate real-world scenarios.

Result: Improved detection and fixing capabilities of API misuse with the best-performing model achieving an F1-score of 61.18% for detection and fixing 51.28% of misuses. The Dschecker agent achieves 48.65% detection F1-score and fixes 39.47% in simulated real-world conditions.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches like DSCHECKER have significant potential for real-world API misuse detection and correction in data science libraries.

Abstract: Data science libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, specialize in
processing and manipulating data. The data-centric nature of these libraries
makes the detection of API misuse in them more challenging. This paper
introduces DSCHECKER, an LLM-based approach designed for detecting and fixing
API misuses of data science libraries. We identify two key pieces of
information, API directives and data information, that may be beneficial for
API misuse detection and fixing. Using three LLMs and misuses from five data
science libraries, we experiment with various prompts. We find that
incorporating API directives and data-specific details enhances Dschecker's
ability to detect and fix API misuses, with the best-performing model achieving
a detection F1-score of 61.18 percent and fixing 51.28 percent of the misuses.
Building on these results, we implement Dschecker agent which includes an
adaptive function calling mechanism to access information on demand, simulating
a real-world setting where information about the misuse is unknown in advance.
We find that Dschecker agent achieves 48.65 percent detection F1-score and
fixes 39.47 percent of the misuses, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based API
misuse detection and fixing in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper explores collaboration practices in developing open large language models (LLMs), analyzing interviews from 14 developers to identify contributions, motivations, organizational structures, and governance methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed to identify opportunities for fostering the open AI ecosystem.

Method: Semi-structured interviews with developers of 14 open LLM projects from diverse geographical regions and institutional backgrounds.

Result: The paper identifies three findings: (1) collaboration in open LLMs involves ecosystems beyond the models (e.g., datasets, forums, partnerships), (2) developers have varied motivations like democratizing AI and expanding language representation, (3) five distinct organizational models for open LLM projects were observed.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical recommendations for stakeholders to better support and promote global collaboration in building open AI systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant
ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However,
the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after
their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our
understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed
as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further.
We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration
throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on
semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots
projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North
America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research
and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the
LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks,
leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute
partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of
social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access
and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding
language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five
distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to
non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of
control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM
lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking
to support the global community building a more open future for AI.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the persistent challenge in Software Engineering of configuring environments for arbitrary repositories and to overcome limitations of existing LLMs in automating this task.

Method: The authors propose tuning a specialized model using supervised fine-tuning for generating Bash scripts and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to improve the automation process.

Result: Their method enables the Qwen3-8B model to achieve comparable performance to larger models like Qwen3-32B and GPT-4o on environment setup tasks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that tuning smaller models with effective strategies can achieve competitive results in environment setup automation, providing accessible solutions for developers. The code and resources are shared for future research.

Abstract: Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a
specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software
Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers
by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without
manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based
benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To
address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We
combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task
of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model
runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B
and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online:

### [603] [BloomAPR: A Bloom's Taxonomy-based Framework for Assessing the Capabilities of LLM-Powered APR Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25465)
*Yinghang Ma,Jiho Shin,Leuson Da Silva,Zhen Ming,Jiang,Song Wang,Foutse Khomh,Shin Hwei Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BloomAPR, a dynamic evaluation framework for analyzing Large Language Model-powered automated program repair solutions. It finds limitations in reasoning capabilities at higher cognitive levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks for evaluating automated program repair models risk data contamination and offer limited assessment for diverse contexts.

Method: BloomAPR uses Bloom's Taxonomy to evaluate reasoning levels of two APR solutions, ChatRepair and CigaR, across three different LLMs using progressively complex reasoning tasks.

Result: APR solutions showed strong basic reasoning capabilities (fixing 81.57% of bugs at the Remember layer) but weaker performance on minor syntactic changes and real-world bug scenarios (13.46% to 41.34% at the Analyze layer).

Conclusion: There is a need for more diverse and trustworthy benchmarks to rigorously evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLM-powered software engineering solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the
development of AI-driven automated program repair (APR) solutions. However,
these solutions are typically evaluated using static benchmarks such as
Defects4J and SWE-bench, which suffer from two key limitations: (1) the risk of
data contamination, potentially inflating evaluation results due to overlap
with LLM training data, and (2) limited ability to assess the APR capabilities
in dynamic and diverse contexts. In this paper, we introduced BloomAPR, a novel
dynamic evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. Our framework offers
a structured approach to assess the cognitive capabilities of LLM-powered APR
solutions across progressively complex reasoning levels. Using Defects4J as a
case study, we evaluated two state-of-the-art LLM-powered APR solutions,
ChatRepair and CigaR, under three different LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-3.1, and
StarCoder-2. Our findings show that while these solutions exhibit basic
reasoning skills and effectively memorize bug-fixing patterns (fixing up to
81.57% of bugs at the Remember layer), their performance increases with
synthetically generated bugs (up to 60.66% increase at the Understand layer).
However, they perform worse on minor syntactic changes (fixing up to 43.32% at
the Apply layer), and they struggle to repair similar bugs when injected into
real-world projects (solving only 13.46% to 41.34% bugs at the Analyze layer).
These results underscore the urgent need for evolving benchmarks and provide a
foundation for more trustworthy evaluation of LLM-powered software engineering
solutions.

*Yonatan Gizachew Achamyeleh,Tongtao Zhang,Joshua Hyunki Kim,Gabriel Garcia,Shih-Yuan Yu,Anton Kocheturov,Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AGNOMIN introduces an architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries, achieving significant improvements in precision, recall, and practical utility for security assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in understanding stripped binaries, vital for vulnerability analysis and patching, by overcoming architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and inconsistent naming conventions.

Method: Combination of Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs)—integrating Code Flow Graphs, Function Call Graphs, and dynamic PCode features—and hierarchical graph neural networks, paired with an advanced decoder for function name prediction.

Result: AGNOMIN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, improving precision by up to 27.17% and recall by 55.86%, along with generalized superior performance across unseen architectures with a recall higher by 5.89%. Its effectiveness was proven during security hackathons.

Conclusion: AGNOMIN stands as a powerful architecture-agnostic solution for consistent, scalable function name predictions, with proven applications in vulnerability patching and aiding reverse engineers in diverse security contexts.

Abstract: Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in
software reverse engineering, a key step for \textbf{enabling subsequent
vulnerability analysis and patching}. However, existing approaches often
struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse
naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach
for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds
Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs,
Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A
hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate
consistent function representations across architectures, vital for
\textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN
employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer
and algorithmic improvements.
  We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable
binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in
precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN
generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than
the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through
security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing
and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.

*Luiza Martins de Freitas Cintra,Philipp Zech,Mohamad Kassab,Eliomar Araújo Lima,Sofia Larissa da Costa Paiva,Valdemar Vicente Graciano Neto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a checklist to assist software engineers in selecting suitable modeling and simulation (M&S) paradigms for systems like digital twins and smart cities. Three formalisms—DEVS, System Dynamics, and Agent-Based Simulation—are analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to integrate modeling and simulation into the software development cycle for complex systems such as digital twins and smart cities, combined with difficulties faced by newcomers in selecting suitable paradigms.

Method: The authors constructed a preliminary checklist based on three M&S formalisms (DEVS, System Dynamics, Agent-Based Simulation), conducted a pilot study, and consulted an expert to evaluate the checklist's efficacy.

Result: The checklist showed alignment with the chosen formalism in original studies and received positive feedback from the consulted expert.

Conclusion: The preliminary checklist aids beginners in M&S in choosing appropriate paradigms, showing promising results for further refinement and wider application.

Abstract: The advent of increasingly complex and dynamic ecosystems, such as digital
twins (DT), smart cities and Industry 4.0 and 5.0, has made evident the need to
include modeling and simulation (M&S) in the software development life cycle.
Such disruptive systems include simulation models in their own architecture
(such as DT) or require the use of simulation models to represent the high
degree of movement and the multiplicity of interactions that occur between the
involved systems. However, when software engineers (particularly the newcomers)
need to use M&S in their projects, they often pose themselves an important
question: which formalism should I use? In this direction, the main
contribution of this paper is the establishment of a preliminary checklist with
questions to assist beginners in M&S in choosing the most appropriate paradigm
to solve their problems. The checklist is based on three main formalisms: DEVS,
System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation. A pilot study was carried out and
an expert was consulted. The preliminary results show (i) conformance between
the suggestion given by the checklist and the formalism selected in the
original studies used as input for evaluating the checklist, and (ii) a
positive feedback from the expert.

### [606] [Explainable Fault Localization for Programming Assignments via LLM-Guided Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25676)
*Fang Liu,Tianze Wang,Li Zhang,Zheyu Yang,Jing Jiang,Zian Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLAME is a novel Fault Localization method using LLM-guided annotation and multi-model ensembles, excelling in programming assignments and general-purpose software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Fault Localization techniques are too coarse and lack explanatory feedback for students, making them less effective in educational contexts.

Method: FLAME uses LLM-guided annotations to provide fault explanations and employs a weighted multi-model voting strategy for better accuracy.

Result: FLAME achieves superior fault localization, identifying 207 more faults on programming assignments and outperforming baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.

Conclusion: FLAME offers fine-grained, explainable fault localization that benefits both educational and general-purpose scenarios, with improved accuracy and learning value.

Abstract: Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming
assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete
assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated
Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in
identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges
when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method
level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for
students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While
some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on
predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to
LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained,
explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via
LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual
information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying
faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the
LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both
localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we
introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from
multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault
localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207
more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational
contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software
codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes an enhanced technique for API prediction and high-quality code generation with a new dataset and an efficient compact model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search and code generation tools lack robust mechanisms for accurate API prediction and suffer from API leaks in benchmark datasets.

Method: Introduces a new dataset from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes, along with an optimized post-training pipeline using fine-tuning, synthetic datasets, and reinforcement learning for a compact 0.6B reranker.

Result: Achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy and enables a compact model to surpass an 8B model with 2.5x reduced latency.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances API prediction and code generation performance effectively, addressing enterprise-specific code needs with less computational overhead.

Abstract: Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code
and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality,
end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We
address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by
introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that
capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation
metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy,
allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code
generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive
post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic
dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This
approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model
while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of
enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.

### [608] [Are Classical Clone Detectors Good Enough For the AI Era?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25754)
*Ajmain Inqiad Alam,Palash Roy,Farouq Al-omari,Chanchal Roy,Banani Roy,Kevin Schneider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates nine classical code clone detection tools on AI-generated clones using GPTCloneBench, finding that many tools remain effective, especially with normalization techniques, but show performance discrepancies compared to traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift towards AI-generated code introduces new syntactic and semantic patterns, creating challenges for classical code clone detection tools initially designed for human-written code.

Method: The authors evaluated nine CCD tools using a benchmark of AI-generated clones (GPTCloneBench) and compared the results with human-authored benchmarks like BigCloneBench and SemanticCloneBench to measure performance differences.

Result: Classical CCD tools retain significant effectiveness against AI-generated code, especially with normalization techniques, though some tools showed varying performance when compared to traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: Classical CCD tools can still perform well on AI-generated code, but understanding their limitations, especially in scalability and execution time, is crucial for practical use.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated code has reshaped modern software
development, introducing syntactic and semantic variations in cloned code.
Unlike traditional human-written clones, AI-generated clones exhibit systematic
syntactic patterns and semantic differences learned from large-scale training
data. This shift presents new challenges for classical code clone detection
(CCD) tools, which have historically been validated primarily on human-authored
codebases and optimized to detect syntactic (Type 1-3) and limited semantic
clones. Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex
semantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD
tools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine
widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing
GPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further
test these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench
and SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between
traditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical
CCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques,
retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some
exhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks. This
paper contributes by (1) evaluating classical CCD tools against AI-generated
clones, providing critical insights into their current strengths and
limitations; (2) highlighting the role of normalization techniques in improving
detection accuracy; and (3) delivering detailed scalability and execution-time
analyses to support practical CCD tool selection.

### [609] [LogPilot: Intent-aware and Scalable Alert Diagnosis for Large-scale Online Service Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25874)
*Zhihan Jiang,Jinyang Liu,Yichen Li,Haiyu Huang,Xiao He,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Yi Li,Rui Shi,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogPilot, a framework for automated log-based alert diagnosis using Large Language Models (LLMs), improving diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and cost over existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-call engineers managing large-scale online service systems are overwhelmed by manual log inspections to diagnose alerts. Current automated tools face limitations in log relevance and effective data organization, making root cause analysis challenging.

Method: LogPilot uses an intent-aware mechanism to parse alert definitions, enabling precise log scoping. It then organizes logs into spatiotemporal clusters to identify patterns, which are compressed into representative samples for LLM-based diagnosis.

Result: LogPilot demonstrated a 50.34% improvement in root cause summarization usefulness and a 54.79% enhancement in localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. It operates within a minute per diagnosis at a cost of $0.074 per alert.

Conclusion: LogPilot proves effective in real-world scenarios, offering scalable, fast, and cost-efficient alert diagnosis, addressing the limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Effective alert diagnosis is essential for ensuring the reliability of
large-scale online service systems. However, on-call engineers are often
burdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root
causes. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in
practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize
complex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot
introduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert
definitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and
requests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into
a spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring
execution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for
diagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in
diagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window.
Evaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the
usefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization
accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods. With a diagnosis time under
one minute and a cost of only $0.074 per alert, LogPilot has been successfully
deployed in production, offering an automated and practical solution for
service alert diagnosis.

*Simin Chen,Yixin He,Suman Jana,Baishakhi Ray*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWExploit, a tool aimed at highlighting the security vulnerabilities in automated program repair agents by generating adversarial issues that can mislead them into creating functionally correct but insecure patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the overlooked security risks in automated program repair (APR) systems, particularly the potential for adversarial users to exploit these systems by submitting deceptive issues on GitHub.

Method: SWExploit employs a three-step process: program analysis to find vulnerable injection points, generation of adversarial issue statements while keeping original semantics, and iterative refinement based on APR agent responses.

Result: Experiments conducted on three APR pipelines and five backend LLMs showed that SWExploit successfully generates patches that are both functionally correct and vulnerable, achieving attack success rates up to 0.91 compared to a baseline of below 0.20.

Conclusion: The study challenges the assumption that patches passing tests are secure, urging a reassessment of APR agent evaluation paradigms to also consider security vulnerabilities.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for software maintenance tasks
such as automated program repair (APR). APR agents automatically fetch GitHub
issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs.
However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of
APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while
largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like
GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an
important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on
GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct
but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which
generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce
patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in
three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points
for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading
reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue
semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements
based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent
pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that
are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the
correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20).
Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional
assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure,
highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR
agents.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-Log, a reasoning-based paradigm for log analysis, which employs reinforcement learning and mirrors human reasoning processes. It addresses issues of overfitting and hallucinations seen in direct supervised fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for log analysis using Large Language Models suffer from overfitting and hallucinations due to the domain mismatch and imbalance in loss calculation.

Method: R-Log uses a reasoning-based process inspired by human engineers and reinforces the model using reinforcement learning with a joint reward function. It starts with a curated dataset and refines its ability in a simulated environment.

Result: R-Log significantly outperforms existing log analysis methods across five tasks, showing a notable advantage in unseen scenarios with a performance improvement of 228.05%. A faster variant, R-Log-fast, achieves a 5x speedup while retaining 93% efficiency.

Conclusion: R-Log represents a major advancement in log analysis, leveraging reasoning and reinforcement learning to overcome traditional challenges, offering both accuracy and efficiency boosts.

Abstract: The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current
approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label
pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose
LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's
imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm
critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To
address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm
that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human
engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying
rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing
hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first
cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13
strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning
capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.
Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing
methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by
228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the
efficacy.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces JiraGPT Next, which integrates GPT language models into Jira to simplify data handling in project management through natural language interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Project managers face challenges in handling diverse and large streams of data essential for effective decision-making in tasks like timelines, budgets, and resource optimization.

Method: The authors developed JiraGPT Next as an add-on for Jira, leveraging GPT language models to offer natural language interaction for retrieving complex project data.

Result: The paper evaluates the accuracy and effectiveness of GPT, focusing on how varied prompts impact task completion using JiraGPT Next.

Conclusion: JiraGPT Next reduces the complexity for project managers by enabling intuitive natural language information retrieval, improving accessibility to project data insight.

Abstract: In the domain of Project Management, the sheer volume of data is a challenge
that project managers continually have to deal with. Effectively steering
projects from inception to completion requires handling of diverse information
streams, including timelines, budgetary considerations, and task dependencies.
To navigate this data-driven landscape with precision and agility, project
managers must rely on efficient and sophisticated tools. These tools have
become essential, as they enable project managers to streamline communication,
optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions in real-time.
However, many of these tools have steep learning curves and require using
complex programming languages to retrieve the exact data that project managers
need. In this work we present JiraGPT Next, a software that uses the GPT Large
Language Model to ease the process by which project managers deal with large
amounts of data. It is conceived as an add-on for Jira, one of the most popular
Project Management tools, and provides a natural language interface to retrieve
information. This work presents the design decisions behind JiraGPT Next and an
evaluation of the accuracy of GPT in this context, including the effects of
providing different prompts to complete a particular task.

### [613] [Evaluating the impact of code smell refactoring on the energy consumption of Android applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26031)
*Hina Anwar,Dietmar Pfahl,Satish N. Srirama*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of code refactoring on the energy consumption of Android apps, finding both positive impacts for specific refactorings and variability across permutations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile apps' energy efficiency can be improved through better app quality, and frequent code refactoring is hypothesized to contribute to this improvement.

Method: The study explores the energy and performance effects of refactoring several code smells in Android apps, including 'Duplicated code' and 'Type checking.'

Result: Refactoring certain code smells reduced energy use by up to 10.8%, although gains were not consistently linked to execution time changes. Permutation and order of refactorings showed varied results.

Conclusion: The effect of refactorings on energy use is complex and not fully understood. More research is needed to examine how specific factors like app size, age, and contributor experience influence energy consumption and refactoring outcomes.

Abstract: Energy consumption of mobile apps is a domain that is receiving a lot of
attention from researchers. Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption
of mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps.
Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we
explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings
in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell
refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps.
Refactoring of the code smells "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" reduce
energy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption,
however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of
execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell
refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order
in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that
some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy
consumption for the analyzed apps. More research needs to be done to
investigate how factors like size and age of software apps, experience, and
number of contributors to app development correlate with (a) the number and
type of code smells found and (b) the impact of energy consumption and
performance after refactoring.

*Dmitriy Kostunin,Vladimir Sotnikov,Sergo Golovachev,Abhay Mehta,Tim Lukas Holch,Elisa Jones*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of using LLMs for specialized scientific libraries like Gammapy and presents an agent capable of code generation, execution, and validation in a controlled environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized scientific libraries often lack robust documentation and examples, making it challenging for LLMs trained on outdated or minimal data to generate accurate and effective code.

Method: The authors develop an agent designed to write, execute, and validate code within a controlled environment, tailored for the Gammapy library. They also present a web demo and benchmarking suite to support their approach.

Result: The paper reports the design and implementation of the agent, introduces a web demo, and provides a benchmark for evaluating its performance.

Conclusion: The proposed agent effectively addresses challenges in code generation for specialized libraries, and future steps are outlined to further refine the implementation and utility of the system.

Abstract: Software code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the
most successful applications of modern artificial intelligence. Foundational
models are very effective for popular frameworks that benefit from
documentation, examples, and strong community support. In contrast, specialized
scientific libraries often lack these resources and may expose unstable APIs
under active development, making it difficult for models trained on limited or
outdated data. We address these issues for the Gammapy library by developing an
agent capable of writing, executing, and validating code in a controlled
environment. We present a minimal web demo and an accompanying benchmarking
suite. This contribution summarizes the design, reports our current status, and
outlines next steps.

### [615] [A Multi-Language Object-Oriented Programming Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26111)
*Shuai Wang,Liang Ding,Li Shen,Yong Luo,Han Hu,Lefei Zhang,Fu Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming benchmark that assesses the code generation capabilities of LLMs in six languages, addressing existing biases in prior benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code generation benchmarks focus on a single programming language, function/statement-level tasks, and include few test cases, limiting their scope for evaluating LLMs' comprehensive coding abilities.

Method: The authors developed MultiOOP, which extends a single-language OOP benchmark to six languages using a translation framework, added augmented test cases for reliability, and employed the enhanced pass@o metric for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation across 14 LLMs showed significant performance drops on the benchmark (e.g., up to 65.6% reduced pass@1 scores), high variability across languages, and limitations in capturing core OOP concepts effectively.

Conclusion: MultiOOP, with its fairness and comprehensiveness, reveals critical limitations in LLMs' multilingual and conceptual understanding in code generation, highlighting the need for improved model capabilities and more inclusive benchmarks.

Abstract: Establishing fair and robust benchmarks is essential for evaluating
intelligent code generation by large language models (LLMs). Our survey of 35
existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single
programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level
tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address
these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming
benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an
existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual
setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases
to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream
LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial
performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6
percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2)
Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but
only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual
generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2
points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable
code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric
extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more
balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code
generation. Our code and data will be released at

### [616] [Understanding Collective Social Behavior in OSS Communities: A Co-editing Network Analysis of Activity Cascades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26173)
*Lisi Qarkaxhija,Maximilian Carparo,Stefan Menzel,Bernhard Sendhoff,Ingo Scholtes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the activity and social interaction patterns of OSS developers, identifying key phenomena like activity cascades and their role in developer churn prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the social and behavioral dynamics of OSS developers to model and predict the sustainability of OSS communities.

Method: The authors adopt network-based modeling to analyze developer interactions via co-editing networks, identifying activity cascades from developer activity data from 50 OSS communities.

Result: The study finds activity cascades to be statistically significant in over half of the projects and demonstrates their utility in predicting developer churn.

Conclusion: The research highlights the relevance of activity cascades in understanding OSS community dynamics, and provides a practical tool for anticipating developer disengagement and retention trends.

Abstract: Understanding the collective social behavior of software developers is
crucial to model and predict the long-term dynamics and sustainability of Open
Source Software (OSS) communities. To this end, we analyze temporal activity
patterns of developers, revealing an inherently ``bursty'' nature of commit
contributions. To investigate the social mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
adopt a network-based modelling framework that captures developer interactions
through co-editing networks. Our framework models social interactions, where a
developer editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity
among collaborators. Using a large data set on 50 major OSS communities, we
further develop a method that identifies activity cascades, i.e. the
propagation of developer activity in the underlying co-editing network. Our
results suggest that activity cascades are a statistically significant
phenomenon in more than half of the studied projects. We further show that our
insights can be used to develop a simple yet practical churn prediction method
that forecasts which developers are likely to leave a project. Our work sheds
light on the emergent collective social dynamics in OSS communities and
highlights the importance of activity cascades to understand developer churn
and retention in collaborative software projects.

*Rangeet Pan,Tyler Stennett,Raju Pavuluri,Nate Levin,Alessandro Orso,Saurabh Sinha*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines developer-written tests for Java applications to identify gaps in automated test generation (ATG) tools and their ability to mimic these tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding developer-written tests and improve automated test generation techniques.

Method: Conducting an empirical study of 1.7 million test cases from open-source Java repositories, analyzing their scope, fixtures, assertions, input types, and use of mocking. Comparison is then made with two state-of-the-art ATG tools.

Result: Developer-written tests exhibit characteristics that current ATG tools cannot fully replicate. This highlights limitations in the tools' capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper identifies research directions to improve ATG tools, aiming to generate tests that are more aligned with human-written ones, paving the way for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Automated test generation (ATG), which aims to reduce the cost of manual test
suite development, has been investigated for decades and has produced countless
techniques based on a variety of approaches: symbolic analysis, search-based,
random and adaptive-random, learning-based, and, most recently,
large-language-model-based approaches. However, despite this large body of
research, there is still a gap in our understanding of the characteristics of
developer-written tests and, consequently, in our assessment of how well ATG
techniques and tools can generate realistic and representative tests. To bridge
this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study of developer-written tests
for Java applications, covering 1.7 million test cases from open-source
repositories. Our study is the first of its kind in studying aspects of
developer-written tests that are mostly neglected in the existing literature,
such as test scope, test fixtures and assertions, types of inputs, and use of
mocking. Based on the characterization, we then compare existing tests with
those generated by two state-of-the-art ATG tools. Our results highlight that a
vast majority of developer-written tests exhibit characteristics that are
beyond the capabilities of current ATG tools. Finally, based on the insights
gained from the study, we identify promising research directions that can help
bridge the gap between current tool capabilities and more effective tool
support for developer testing practices. We hope that this work can set the
stage for new advances in the field and bring ATG tools closer to generating
the types of tests developers write.

### [618] [UniSage: A Unified and Post-Analysis-Aware Sampling for Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26336)
*Zhouruixing Zhu,Zhihan Jiang,Tianyi Yang,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UniSage is a framework that enhances observability in distributed systems by optimizing the sampling of traces and logs for critical data using a post-analysis-aware approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of large storage overhead and troubleshooting complexity in modern distributed systems caused by the growing volume of traces and logs.

Method: UniSage introduces a post-analysis-aware paradigm with lightweight anomaly detection and root cause analysis on complete data streams, implementing a dual-pillar sampling strategy to prioritize and capture critical system behaviors without redundancy.

Result: Experiments show UniSage achieves a 56.5% capture rate for critical traces and 96.25% for relevant logs at a low sampling rate of 2.5%, improving root cause analysis accuracy by 42.45%. It processes 10 minutes of telemetry data in under 5 seconds.

Conclusion: UniSage provides an efficient and comprehensive approach to mitigating storage and troubleshooting issues in distributed systems, outperforming existing methods and proving its practicality for production usage.

Abstract: Traces and logs are essential for observability and fault diagnosis in modern
distributed systems. However, their ever-growing volume introduces substantial
storage overhead and complicates troubleshooting. Existing approaches typically
adopt a sample-before-analysis paradigm: even when guided by data heuristics,
they inevitably discard failure-related information and hinder transparency in
diagnosing system behavior. To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first
unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware
paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight
and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete
data stream. This process yields fine-grained, service-level diagnostic
insights that guide a dual-pillar sampling strategy for handling both normal
and anomalous scenarios: an analysis-guided sampler prioritizes data implicated
by RCA, while an edge-case-based sampler ensures rare but critical behaviors
are captured. Together, these pillars ensure comprehensive coverage of critical
signals without excessive redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
UniSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At a 2.5%
sampling rate, it captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant
logs, while improving the accuracy (AC@1) of downstream root cause analysis by
42.45%. Furthermore, its efficient pipeline processes 10 minutes of telemetry
data in under 5 seconds, demonstrating its practicality for production
environments.

*Michelle Barker,Jeremy Cohen,Pedro Hernández Serrano,Daniel S. Katz,Kim Martin,Dan Rudmann,Hugh Shanahan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores the importance of robust institutional policies on research software within research-performing organizations (RPOs) and analyzes policy gaps in supporting research software personnel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing dependency of modern research on sustainable research software and personnel, coupled with the inadequate institutional support and recognition they receive.

Method: The study involves outlining the work of the PRO4RS Working Group, which focused on examining and advancing research software policy development globally.

Result: The critical outputs of the PRO4RS WG highlighted key policy gaps, such as insufficient focus on research software personnel, especially in research assessment reform at institutions.

Conclusion: RPOs need to adopt institutional-level policies to better support research software development, its personnel, and align with FAIR and open science principles.

Abstract: As research software becomes increasingly central to modern science,
research-performing organisations (RPOs) need to ensure that their investment
in people, skills and infrastructure around research software produces
sustainable and maintainable software that improves the research they perform,
which in turn improves the overall institution and its reputation and funding,
for example, by competing with peers who lack this approach. However, research
institution management and recognition of research software and its personnel
has mostly often developed in an ad hoc manner. RPO training infrastructures,
recognition and reward structures, have not developed at a sufficient rate to
support and encourage both the widespread use of research software best
practices and the long-term support for technical roles that is required. To
begin to address this fundamental problem for modern research environments,
RPOs must implement and adopt robust policies to support research software
development, use, and sustainability. Despite growing momentum from funders and
publishers around FAIR and open science principles, research
institutional-level policies specifically addressing research software remain
limited or lacking in breadth.
  This article outlines the work of the Policies in Research Organisations for
Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group (WG), a joint initiative of the
Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Research Data Alliance (RDA), which
examined and advanced research software policy development across institutions
worldwide. After consideration of the rationale for institutional policies on
research software, the PRO4RS WG outputs and analysis are utilised to highlight
critical policy gaps, particularly related to consideration of research
software personnel in policy work focused on reform of research assessment.

### [620] [EQ-Robin: Generating Multiple Minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC Test Suites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26458)
*Robin Lee,Youngho Nam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a system to address the risk of illegal inputs invalidating minimal MC/DC coverage by generating diverse test suites for Singular Boolean Expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation is to address the risk in the Robin's Rule algorithm, where its single generated test suite might fail to meet MC/DC coverage due to system constraints rendering certain test cases invalid.

Method: EQ-Robin uses algebraic rearrangements on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of boolean expressions to generate semantically equivalent structural variants. Robin's Rule is then applied to each variant, producing a family of minimal test suites.

Result: The proposed EQ-Robin approach generates multiple minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC test suites, offering resilience and ensuring valid coverage under real-world input constraints.

Conclusion: EQ-Robin mitigates the risks of invalid test cases by systematically generating diverse test suites while preserving the minimality of MC/DC coverage, making it practical and robust for safety-critical verification.

Abstract: Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC), particularly its strict
Unique-Cause form, is a cornerstone of safety-critical software verification. A
recent algorithm, "Robin's Rule," introduced a deterministic method to
construct the theoretical minimum of N+1 test cases for Singular Boolean
Expressions (SBEs). However, this approach yields only a single test suite,
introducing a critical risk: if a test case forming a required 'independence
pair' is an illegal input forbidden by system constraints, the suite fails to
achieve 100% coverage. This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a lightweight pipeline
that systematically generates a family of minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC suites to
mitigate this risk. We introduce a method for systematically generating
semantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression. By applying
Robin's Rule to each structural variant, a diverse set of test suites can be
produced. This provides a resilient path to discovering a valid test suite that
preserves the N+1 minimality guarantee while navigating real-world constraints.
We outline an evaluation plan on TCAS-II-derived SBEs to demonstrate how
EQ-Robin offers a practical solution for ensuring robust MC/DC coverage.

*Junsong Pu,Yichen Li,Zhuangbin Chen,Jinyang Liu,Zhihan Jiang,Jianjun Chen,Rui Shi,Zibin Zheng,Tieying Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces ErrorPrism, a system for reconstructing error propagation paths in microservices, achieving 97% accuracy and improving root cause analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern microservices rely on error wrapping, making it difficult to trace errors from log messages back to their origins.

Method: ErrorPrism uses static analysis to reduce search space and employs an LLM agent for iterative backward search to trace error paths.

Result: Tested on 67 ByteDance microservices, ErrorPrism reconstructed error paths with a 97.0% accuracy for 102 real-world errors.

Conclusion: ErrorPrism outperforms existing tools in error path reconstruction and offers a practical solution for enhancing reliability in cloud systems.

Abstract: Reliability management in cloud service systems is challenging due to the
cascading effect of failures. Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern
microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the
function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from
its technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a
significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation
path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are
ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism
in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in
production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on
service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to
relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space
for subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an
iterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop
error path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism
achieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors,
outperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism
provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial
microservice systems.

### [622] [Towards Verified Code Reasoning by LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26546)
*Meghana Sistla,Gogul Balakrishnan,Pat Rondon,José Cambronero,Michele Tufano,Satish Chandra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of precision in LLM-based code reasoning agents by proposing a method to validate their reasoning automatically using formal verification and program analysis. This approach was tested on uninitialized variable errors and program equivalence queries with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inaccuracies of LLM-based code reasoning agents, which make them unreliable in high-precision tasks such as code understanding, review, and validation of generated code. This unreliability demands manual verification, reducing developer productivity.

Method: The authors propose a method to validate the agent's reasoning by extracting a formal representation of responses and then using formal verification and program analysis tools to confirm the correctness of reasoning steps.

Result: The method successfully validated the reasoning of the agent for 13 out of 20 uninitialized variable errors. It also identified 6 out of 8 incorrect judgments made by the agent in program equivalence queries.

Conclusion: Automatic validation of LLM-based reasoning through formal methods can enhance trustworthiness and utility in code-related tasks, potentially increasing productivity by reducing manual verification efforts.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning
questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from
being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a
software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer
during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an
automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,
improves readability, implements a feature).
  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be
manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses
from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower
developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In
this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided
by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high
level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's
response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis
tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.
  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable
errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the
uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to
validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program
equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8
incorrect judgments made by the agent.

*Denizhan Pak,Quan Le Thien,Christopher J. Agostino*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces a framework using partial differential equations (PDEs) to consider spatial dynamics in brain-body-environment interactions, focusing on adaptive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models often overlook the spatial properties of the brain by treating it only as coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can limit complexity and observable neural behaviors.

Method: The authors use PDEs to incorporate spatio-temporal dynamics into adaptive behavior modeling, re-examining a child-swinging scenario to explore the influence of spatial properties.

Result: The exploration revealed that spatial dynamics and their propagation critically impact behavior, offering deeper insights into adaptive system interactions.

Conclusion: Spatial dynamics are vital in bridging neural models with physical constraints, improving the understanding of brain-body-environment interaction.

Abstract: The brain-body-environment framework studies adaptive behavior through
embodied and situated agents, emphasizing interactions between brains,
biomechanics, and environmental dynamics. However, many models often treat the
brain as a network of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model
complexity but also constrain observable neural dynamics. To address this
limitation, we propose a spatially extended approach using partial differential
equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a
previously developed model of a child swinging, now incorporating spatial
dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body,
we analyze how input location and propagation along a PDE influence behavior.
This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organization in
adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the
physical constraints of embodied systems. Our results highlight the importance
of spatial dynamics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.

*Vasilii Tiselko,Alexander Gorsky,Yuri Dabaghian*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biologically plausible model for understanding receptive field formation and neuronal dynamics using hyperbolic geometry in scale-free networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of explaining how receptive fields emerge and organize naturally within brain networks in a biologically plausible manner.

Method: The authors leverage hyperbolic geometry to model scale-free networks and associate stimulus space with the boundary of hyperbolic embedding. They simulate neural dynamics using rate-based and spiking models.

Result: Localized attractors emerge naturally, reflecting the stimulus space structure and capturing receptive field properties without fine-tuned connectivity. Experimental evidence supports the findings using hippocampal place field recordings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes an organizing principle for receptive field formation and links network structure with stimulus space encoding and neural dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding how neuronal dynamics couple with stimuli space and how
receptive fields emerge and organize within brain networks remains a
fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Several models attempted to explain
these phenomena, often by adjusting the network to empirical manifestations,
but struggled to achieve biological plausibility. Here, we propose a
physiologically grounded model in which receptive fields and population-level
attractor dynamics emerge naturally from the effective hyperbolic geometry of
scale-free networks. In particular, we associate stimulus space with the
boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, and study the resulting neural dynamics in
both rate-based and spiking implementations. The resulting localized attractors
faithfully reflect the structure of the stimulus space and capture key
properties of the receptive fields without fine-tuning of local connectivity,
exhibiting a direct relation between a neuron's connectivity degree and the
corresponding receptive field size. The model generalizes to stimulus spaces of
arbitrary dimensionality and scale, encompassing various modalities, such as
orientation and place selectivity. We also provide direct experimental evidence
in support of these results, based on analyses of hippocampal place fields
recorded on a linear track. Overall, our framework offers a novel organizing
principle for receptive field formation and establishes a direct link between
network structure, stimulus space encoding, and neural dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decode the neural heterogeneity of biological systems and understand complex dynamics by leveraging the most complete Drosophila brain connectome data set.

Method: Performed detailed analyses of both network and spatial structures from the connectome, simulations using the Kuramoto model, and developed a 3D visualization of the data.

Result: Identified modular organization, spatial clustering, bilateral symmetry, and functional asymmetry caused by intrinsic neuron frequencies.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of neural network organization and biological complexity through integrative analysis and visualization.

Abstract: Decoding the heterogeneity of biological neural systems is key to
understanding the nervous system's complex dynamical behaviors. This study
analyzes the comprehensive Drosophila brain connectome, which is the most
recent data set, containing over 130,000 neurons and 50 million synapses. We
conducted meticulous analyses of both network and spatial structure. Our
findings reveal significant heterogeneity in network properties and distinct
spatial clustering across functional regions. Besides, our analysis revealed a
modular organizational pattern within the neural network, wherein regions with
similar functions exhibited higher connection densities, forming distinct
community structures. Moreover, we observed spatial clustering within
functional regions but was not statistically significant. Additionally, we
identify pervasive bilateral symmetry in network topology and spatial
organization. Simulations based on the Kuramoto model demonstrate that the
functional asymmetry between cerebral hemispheres arises from disparities in
the intrinsic frequencies of neurons rather than from structural asymmetry
within the neural network itself. Finally, we develop a 3D connectome
visualization tool for detailed mapping of neuronal morphology. These insights
advance our understanding of neural network organization and complexity in
biological systems.

Abstract: Application of electroencephalography (EEG) in educational research has grown
substantially, yet a comprehensive integration of methodological frameworks,
educational constructs, computational methods, and research gaps remains
limited. This study applies a Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature
Review (BenSLR) to provide a systematic overview of EEG in education.
Literature was extracted from Scopus, screened, and analyzed, with keyword
co-occurrence evaluated using VOSviewer and emerging trends visualized through
an Enhanced Strategic Diagram via BiblioPlot. Key findings include engagement,
attention, and learning style as prominent constructs, with machine learning
and deep learning frequently employed for modeling complex cognitive states.
EEG signal processing, feature extraction, and assessment of cognitive and

as virtual reality and neurofeedback demonstrate EEG's role in supporting
adaptive and individualized learning experiences. Challenges remain in linking
neural markers with observable learning behaviors, extending measurements

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel chaotic dynamics event signal processing framework using Continuous-coupled Neural Network (CCNN) to improve stability and generalization for event camera-based object classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for event cameras struggle with stability and generalization, making them unsuitable for deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper employs a bio-inspired CCNN model that encodes event streams as periodic or chaotic signals and applies continuous wavelet transforms to analyze neuron dynamics for high-order event mapping.

Result: The proposed method integrates CCNN with classification networks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on N-Caltech101 (84.3%) and N-CARS (99.9%) datasets.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves the accuracy, stability, and generalization of event camera-based object classification, advancing practical deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensor that encode visual information
with high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and low latency.Current
state-of-the-art event stream processing methods rely on end-to-end deep
learning techniques. However, these models are heavily dependent on data
structures, limiting their stability and generalization capabilities across
tasks, thereby hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose a chaotic dynamics event signal processing framework
inspired by the dorsal visual pathway of the brain. Specifically, we utilize
Continuous-coupled Neural Network (CCNN) to encode the event stream. CCNN
encodes polarity-invariant event sequences as periodic signals and
polarity=changing event sequences as chaotic signals. We then use continuous
wavelet transforms to analyze the dynamical states of CCNN neurons and
establish the high-order mappings of the event stream. The effectiveness of our
method is validated through integration with conventional classification
networks, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the
N-Caltech101 and N-CARS datasets, with results of 84.3% and 99.9%,
respectively. Our method improves the accuracy of event camera-based object
classification while significantly enhancing the generalization and stability
of event representation. Our code is available in

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates motor adaptation using a visuomotor rotation task and identifies two distinct processes: trajectory straightening and redirection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding motor adaptation mechanisms is crucial as humans often need to adjust to altered sensorimotor conditions.

Method: The study involved a computational analysis and an experimental visuomotor rotation task in a 3D virtual environment.

Result: Participants' trajectories initially showed curvature and misdirection, but with practice, trajectories became straighter and better directed. Additionally, the straightening process was faster than redirection.

Conclusion: The study provides a deeper understanding of motor adaptation, highlighting that two distinct processes govern it and presenting a computational and experimental perspective.

Abstract: Motor adaptation is a learning process that enables humans to regain
proficiency when sensorimotor conditions are sustainably altered. Many studies
have documented the properties of motor adaptation, yet the underlying
mechanisms of motor adaptation remain imperfectly understood. In this study, we
propose a computational analysis of adaptation to a visuomotor rotation task
and examine it through an experiment. Our analysis suggests that two distinct
processes contribute to produce adaptation: one which straightens trajectories,
and another which redirects trajectories. We designed a visuomotor rotation
task in a 3D virtual environment where human participants performed a pointing
task using a head-mounted display controller represented by a cursor that was
visually rotated by an angular deviation relative to its actual position. We
observed that: (1) the trajectories were initially curved and misdirected, and
became straighter and better directed with learning; (2) the straightening
process occurred faster than the redirection process. These findings are
consistent with our computational analysis and disclose a new and different
perspective on motor adaptation.

### [629] [Beyond Suboptimality: Resource-Rationality and Task Demands Shape the Complexity of Perceptual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26606)
*Andrew Jun Lee,Daniel Turek,Omer Daglar Tanrikulu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores how perceptual decision-making can appear suboptimal due to resource-rational strategies that adjust to task demands. Simple or complex representations are chosen depending on these conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the criticism that suboptimal perceptual decision-making stems from inherent limits in representational complexity.

Method: Three experiments were conducted, reducing the effectiveness of resource-rational strategies in a controlled decision task. Model fits assessed representation complexity.

Result: Participants used simpler representations when resource-rational strategies worked and shifted to complex ones when these were ineffective, indicating adaptability in perceptual representations.

Conclusion: Resource-rationality is a crucial factor in experimental design and necessary for a comprehensive perception theory.

Abstract: Early theories of perception as probabilistic inference propose that
uncertainty about the interpretation of sensory input is represented as a
probability distribution over many interpretations -- a relatively complex
representation. However, critics argue that persistent demonstrations of
suboptimal perceptual decision-making indicate limits in representational
complexity. We contend that suboptimality arises not from genuine limits, but
participants' resource-rational adaptations to task demands. For example, when
tasks are solvable with minimal attention to stimuli, participants may neglect
information needed for complex representations, relying instead on simpler ones
that engender suboptimality. Across three experiments, we progressively reduced
the efficacy of resource-rational strategies on a carefully controlled decision
task. Model fits favored simple representations when resource-rational
strategies were effective, and favored complex representations when
ineffective, suggesting that perceptual representations can be simple or
complex depending on task demands. We conclude that resource-rationality is an
epistemic constraint for experimental design and essential to a complete theory
of perception.

### [630] [Neural Optimal Transport Meets Multivariate Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25444)
*Vladimir Kondratyev,Alexander Fishkov,Nikita Kotelevskii,Mahmoud Hegazy,Remi Flamary,Maxim Panov,Eric Moulines*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditional Vector Quantile Regression (CVQR) using neural optimal transport and amortized optimization and applies it to multivariate conformal prediction for efficient and geometry-adaptive predictive regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantile regression methods struggle with multivariate responses, and many approaches fail to capture the geometry of joint distributions in prediction regions.

Method: The conditional vector quantile function is modeled as the gradient of a convex potential via an input-convex neural network, supported by amortized optimization to improve computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed method achieves tighter, geometry-adaptive predictive regions and better coverage-efficiency trade-offs in experiments compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CVQR successfully integrates neural optimal transport with conformal prediction to provide computationally efficient, accurate, and geometry-aware predictive regions.

Abstract: We propose a framework for conditional vector quantile regression (CVQR) that
combines neural optimal transport with amortized optimization, and apply it to
multivariate conformal prediction. Classical quantile regression does not
extend naturally to multivariate responses, while existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of joint distributions. Our method parametrizes the
conditional vector quantile function as the gradient of a convex potential
implemented by an input-convex neural network, ensuring monotonicity and
uniform ranks. To reduce the cost of solving high-dimensional variational
problems, we introduced amortized optimization of the dual potentials, yielding
efficient training and faster inference. We then exploit the induced
multivariate ranks for conformal prediction, constructing distribution-free
predictive regions with finite-sample validity. Unlike coordinatewise methods,
our approach adapts to the geometry of the conditional distribution, producing
tighter and more informative regions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show
improved coverage-efficiency trade-offs compared to baselines, highlighting the
benefits of integrating neural optimal transport with conformal prediction.

### [631] [Fair Classification by Direct Intervention on Operating Characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25481)
*Kevin Jiang,Edgar Dobriban*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces classifiers that tackle binary classification under multiple group fairness constraints by intervening in the operating characteristics of a pre-trained classifier using ROC convex hulls and post-processing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of achieving group fairness in binary classification with multiple constraints such as demographic parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity.

Method: A novel approach that modifies the operating characteristics of pre-trained classifiers with post-processing techniques like group-wise thresholding rules and interventions.

Result: The methods effectively satisfy fairness constraints (DP, EO, PP) with minimal interventions and maintain near-oracle classifier accuracy on standard datasets like COMPAS and ACSIncome.

Conclusion: The proposed methods outperform existing approaches in achieving fairness and maintaining accuracy simultaneously, offering practical solutions for scenarios with multiple protected attributes and fairness constraints.

Abstract: We develop new classifiers under group fairness in the attribute-aware
setting for binary classification with multiple group fairness constraints
(e.g., demographic parity (DP), equalized odds (EO), and predictive parity
(PP)). We propose a novel approach, applicable to linear fractional
constraints, based on directly intervening on the operating characteristics of
a pre-trained base classifier, by (i) identifying optimal operating
characteristics using the base classifier's group-wise ROC convex hulls and
(ii) post-processing the base classifier to match those targets. As practical
post-processors, we consider randomizing a mixture of group-wise thresholding
rules subject to minimizing the expected number of interventions. We further
extend our approach to handle multiple protected attributes and multiple linear
fractional constraints. On standard datasets (COMPAS and ACSIncome), our
methods simultaneously satisfy approximate DP, EO, and PP with few
interventions and a near-oracle drop in accuracy; comparing favorably to
previous methods.

### [632] [One-shot Conditional Sampling: MMD meets Nearest Neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25507)
*Anirban Chatterjee,Sayantan Choudhury,Rohan Hore*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces CGMMD, a framework for efficient conditional sampling using MMD, suitable for practical one-shot sampling and low test-time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of sampling from conditional distributions in applications like computer vision and simulation-based inference using adaptive and efficient methods.

Method: CGMMD uses a Minimum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)-based training objective without adversaries and allows sampling in a single generator pass.

Result: The paper provides theoretical guarantees for loss bounds and convergence, alongside strong empirical performance in complex and practical tasks like image processing.

Conclusion: CGMMD is a robust and efficient framework for conditional sampling, offering both theoretical soundness and competitive performance in relevant applications.

Abstract: How can we generate samples from a conditional distribution that we never
fully observe? This question arises across a broad range of applications in
both modern machine learning and classical statistics, including image
post-processing in computer vision, approximate posterior sampling in
simulation-based inference, and conditional distribution modeling in complex
data settings. In such settings, compared with unconditional sampling,
additional feature information can be leveraged to enable more adaptive and
efficient sampling. Building on this, we introduce Conditional Generator using
MMD (CGMMD), a novel framework for conditional sampling. Unlike many
contemporary approaches, our method frames the training objective as a simple,
adversary-free direct minimization problem. A key feature of CGMMD is its
ability to produce conditional samples in a single forward pass of the
generator, enabling practical one-shot sampling with low test-time complexity.
We establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the loss incurred when sampling
from the CGMMD sampler, and prove convergence of the estimated distribution to
the true conditional distribution. In the process, we also develop a uniform
concentration result for nearest-neighbor based functionals, which may be of
independent interest. Finally, we show that CGMMD performs competitively on
synthetic tasks involving complex conditional densities, as well as on
practical applications such as image denoising and image super-resolution.

### [633] [Conservative Decisions with Risk Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25588)
*Yishu Wei,Wen-Yee Lee,George Ekow Quaye,Xiaogang Su*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for binary classification with abstention by optimizing the cutoff interval for risk scores, resulting in higher accuracy outside the abstention range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conservative decision-making in binary classification, especially scenarios requiring abstention for better precision, is an underexplored area. This paper aims to improve decision-making by introducing a more adaptive and flexible approach.

Method: The approach minimizes the classification margin (unlike traditional SVMs that maximize it) to determine the optimal cutoff interval for risk scores, outside which classification accuracy is maximized. The result is a risk-coverage curve suitable for evaluation.

Result: The method is theoretically validated and tested through simulation studies and a real-world case of diagnosing prostate cancer, showcasing its utility and accuracy-improvement potential.

Conclusion: This method not only facilitates more cautious decision-making but also provides a new metric based on the risk-coverage curve, complementing traditional tools like the ROC curve for evaluating classifiers.

Abstract: In binary classification applications, conservative decision-making that
allows for abstention can be advantageous. To this end, we introduce a novel
approach that determines the optimal cutoff interval for risk scores, which can
be directly available or derived from fitted models. Within this interval, the
algorithm refrains from making decisions, while outside the interval,
classification accuracy is maximized. Our approach is inspired by support
vector machines (SVM), but differs in that it minimizes the classification
margin rather than maximizing it. We provide the theoretical optimal solution
to this problem, which holds important practical implications. Our proposed
method not only supports conservative decision-making but also inherently
results in a risk-coverage curve. Together with the area under the curve (AUC),
this curve can serve as a comprehensive performance metric for evaluating and
comparing classifiers, akin to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve. To investigate and illustrate our approach, we conduct both simulation
studies and a real-world case study in the context of diagnosing prostate
cancer.

### [634] [Coupling Generative Modeling and an Autoencoder with the Causal Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25599)
*Ruolin Meng,Ming-Yu Chung,Dhanajit Brahma,Ricardo Henao,Lawrence Carin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method for estimating causal treatment effects in the presence of unobserved confounders using control (proxy) measurements and a framework called the causal bridge (CB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of inferring treatment effects when there are unobserved confounders, which complicate traditional causal analysis methods.

Method: The authors introduce the causal bridge (CB) framework and theoretical assumptions for its use, as well as explore its integration into an autoencoder architecture to improve estimates through statistical sharing among variables.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates improved estimation performance of treatment effects on both synthetic and real-world datasets when compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: The causal bridge approach, particularly when combined with autoencoder architectures, is effective for estimating treatment effects in scenarios with unobserved confounding, leveraging proxy measurements efficiently.

Abstract: We consider inferring the causal effect of a treatment (intervention) on an
outcome of interest in situations where there is potentially an unobserved
confounder influencing both the treatment and the outcome. This is achievable
by assuming access to two separate sets of control (proxy) measurements
associated with treatment and outcomes, which are used to estimate treatment
effects through a function termed the em causal bridge (CB). We present a new
theoretical perspective, associated assumptions for when estimating treatment
effects with the CB is feasible, and a bound on the average error of the
treatment effect when the CB assumptions are violated. From this new
perspective, we then demonstrate how coupling the CB with an autoencoder
architecture allows for the sharing of statistical strength between observed
quantities (proxies, treatment, and outcomes), thus improving the quality of
the CB estimates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach in relation to the state-of-the-art
methodology for proxy measurements.

### [635] [When Langevin Monte Carlo Meets Randomization: Non-asymptotic Error Bounds beyond Log-Concavity and Gradient Lipschitzness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25630)
*Xiaojie Wang,Bin Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper revisits the randomized Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC) algorithm for sampling high-dimensional distributions, extending its application to non-log-concave cases and proposing modifications for non-globally Lipschitz gradient settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling effectively from complex and high-dimensional distributions is a fundamental task across scientific computing, statistics, and machine learning, especially beyond log-concave cases.

Method: The paper analyzes RLMC under gradient Lipschitz and log-Sobolev conditions, proving uniform error bounds in $
abla^2$-distance. It also proposes modified RLMC algorithms for scenarios involving superlinear growth in gradient non-global Lipschitz cases.

Result: Uniform-in-time error bounds of $O(\sqrt{d}h)$ are achieved for RLMC under log-Sobolev and gradient Lipschitz conditions. Modified RLMC algorithms and non-asymptotic error bounds are introduced for non-globally Lipschitz gradients.

Conclusion: The findings improve understanding of RLMC's capabilities for sampling high-dimensional distributions even in non-log-concave cases, introducing novel modified algorithms for broader applicability.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from complex and high dimensional target distributions
turns out to be a fundamental task in diverse disciplines such as scientific
computing, statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we revisit the
randomized Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC) for sampling from high dimensional
distributions without log-concavity. Under the gradient Lipschitz condition and
the log-Sobolev inequality, we prove a uniform-in-time error bound in
$\mathcal{W}_2$-distance of order $O(\sqrt{d}h)$ for the RLMC sampling
algorithm, which matches the best one in the literature under the log-concavity
condition. Moreover, when the gradient of the potential $U$ is non-globally
Lipschitz with superlinear growth, modified RLMC algorithms are proposed and
analyzed, with non-asymptotic error bounds established. To the best of our
knowledge, the modified RLMC algorithms and their non-asymptotic error bounds
are new in the non-globally Lipschitz setting.

### [636] [Test time training enhances in-context learning of nonlinear functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25741)
*Kento Kuwataka,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores Test-Time Training (TTT) with In-Context Learning (ICL) for nonlinear models, developing theoretical insights into its performance enhancement for single-layer transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited theoretical understanding of how Test-Time Training (TTT) improves nonlinear models, and its potential when combined with In-Context Learning (ICL).

Method: Analyzes single-index models and establishes theoretical bounds on prediction risk for single-layer transformers using gradient-based training and TTT.

Result: TTT enables single-layer transformers to adapt to varying feature vectors and link functions, outperforming standalone ICL in handling link function shifts. Convergence rates also show predictive error can approach noise levels with increased context size and network width.

Conclusion: TTT significantly improves adaptation in single-layer transformers trained with ICL, providing theoretical guarantees and establishing its effectiveness in nonlinear learning tasks.

Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) enhances model performance by explicitly updating
designated parameters prior to each prediction to adapt to the test data. While
TTT has demonstrated considerable empirical success, its theoretical
underpinnings remain limited, particularly for nonlinear models. In this paper,
we investigate the combination of TTT with in-context learning (ICL), where the
model is given a few examples from the target distribution at inference time.
We analyze this framework in the setting of single-index models
$y=\sigma_*(\langle \beta, \mathbf{x} \rangle)$, where the feature vector
$\beta$ is drawn from a hidden low-dimensional subspace. For single-layer
transformers trained with gradient-based algorithms and adopting TTT, we
establish an upper bound on the prediction risk. Our theory reveals that TTT
enables the single-layer transformers to adapt to both the feature vector
$\beta$ and the link function $\sigma_*$, which vary across tasks. This creates
a sharp contrast with ICL alone, which is theoretically difficult to adapt to
shifts in the link function. Moreover, we provide the convergence rate with
respect to the data length, showing the predictive error can be driven
arbitrarily close to the noise level as the context size and the network width
grow.

### [637] [Estimating Dimensionality of Neural Representations from Finite Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26560)
*Chanwoo Chun,Abdulkadir Canatar,SueYeon Chung,Daniel Lee*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes a bias-corrected dimensionality estimator for neural manifolds that's sample-size invariant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand global dimensionality of neural representation manifolds and address biases in existing measures.

Method: Introduces a bias-corrected estimator for global dimensionality and validates it with synthetic data and various neural recordings.

Result: Shows the estimator's invariance to sample size and ability to recover true dimensionality on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: The estimator offers accurate dimensionality measurement, including local analysis of curved neural manifolds, even with finite samples.

Abstract: The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich
insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and
biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global
dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows
and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the
participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality,
is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected
estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On
synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true
known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings,
including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and
to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is
invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used
to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting
the finite samples appropriately.

### [638] [Sharpness of Minima in Deep Matrix Factorization: Exact Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25783)
*Anil Kamber,Rahul Parhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper provides the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian in deep matrix factorization problems, addressing a long-standing open question and investigating its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the geometry of loss landscapes in deep learning to explain implicit biases of gradient-based methods, particularly the sharpness measure quantified by the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian near minima.

Method: The authors derive an exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian in general overparameterized settings of deep matrix factorization and supplement their findings with empirical investigations of gradient-based escape phenomena near minima.

Result: They successfully compute the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian at any minimizer and observe an escape phenomenon during training, which aligns with their theoretical derivations.

Conclusion: This work resolves a critical open question in deep learning, elucidates the role of sharpness in loss landscapes, and provides a foundation for further studies on optimization dynamics in neural networks.

Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to
explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex
optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix
factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum
eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the
landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact
expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this
paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the
Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized
deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems,
resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff & Michaeli (2020). To complement
our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during
gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact
expression of the sharpness.

*Yanan Zhao,Feng Ji,Xingchao Jian,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for graph signal processing (GSP) using graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs) to address limitations of traditional GSP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to overcome the limitations of classical vector-based graph signal processing, including its inability to account for uncertainty, its strict dependence on synchronous observations, and limitations in graph filtering.

Method: The paper proposed representing signals as probability distributions in the Wasserstein space instead of vectors, thereby generalizing key concepts of GSP to work with graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs). A systematic dictionary mapping classical GSP to GDS is established.

Result: The framework proved effective in graph filter learning for prediction tasks, supported by experimental evidence.

Conclusion: By introducing graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs), this framework overcomes classical GSP limitations, naturally encodes stochasticity, and generalizes classical approaches. Experimental validation confirms its effectiveness in predictive applications.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for graph signal processing (GSP) that models
signals as graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs), which are probability
distributions in the Wasserstein space. This approach overcomes key limitations
of classical vector-based GSP, including the assumption of synchronous
observations over vertices, the inability to capture uncertainty, and the
requirement for strict correspondence in graph filtering. By representing
signals as distributions, GDSs naturally encode uncertainty and stochasticity,
while strictly generalizing traditional graph signals. We establish a
systematic dictionary mapping core GSP concepts to their GDS counterparts,
demonstrating that classical definitions are recovered as special cases. The
effectiveness of the framework is validated through graph filter learning for
prediction tasks, supported by experimental results.

### [640] [BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories under Spatio-Temporal Vector Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26005)
*Rui-Yang Zhang,Henry B. Moss,Lachlan Astfalck,Edward Cripps,David S. Leslie*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces BALLAST, a Bayesian active learning method to optimally guide placements of Lagrangian observers in ocean science using a physics-informed Gaussian process surrogate model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to placing Lagrangian observers for inferring vector fields in oceanography rely on space-filling designs or expert opinions, which lack principled active learning methodologies.

Method: The methodology integrates a physics-informed spatio-temporal Gaussian process model with Bayesian active learning principles and a look-ahead mechanism to account for future trajectories of observers.

Result: BALLAST demonstrates significant improvements in sequential observer placement strategies when evaluated using both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.

Conclusion: This approach enhances observer placement in dynamic fields, promising advances in oceanographic measurements and modeling efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a formal active learning methodology for guiding the placement
of Lagrangian observers to infer time-dependent vector fields -- a key task in
oceanography, marine science, and ocean engineering -- using a physics-informed
spatio-temporal Gaussian process surrogate model. The majority of existing
placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or
relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled
active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously
advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different
locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future
trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate
placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning
with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable
benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both
synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.

### [641] [Non-Vacuous Generalization Bounds: Can Rescaling Invariances Help?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26149)
*Damien Rouchouse,Antoine Gonon,Rémi Gribonval,Benjamin Guedj*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of rescaling invariances in PAC-Bayes bounds for ReLU networks by introducing an invariant, lifted representation that improves generalization guarantees and bound tightness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address issues with PAC-Bayes generalization bounds caused by rescaling invariances of weight distributions in ReLU networks, as these can lead to arbitrarily divergent results even when the represented function remains identical.

Method: The authors propose a lifted representation for studying PAC-Bayes bounds, ensuring invariance and reducing discrepancies caused by rescaling. They analyze guarantees (like invariance and tighter bounds) and develop algorithms for KL-based rescaling-invariant PAC-Bayes bounds.

Result: The results indicate that the proposed invariant representation resolves discrepancies, provides tighter bounds, and enhances the guarantees offered by PAC-Bayes bounds.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that addressing rescaling invariances through a lifted representation significantly improves the theoretical and practical aspects of PAC-Bayes generalization guarantees.

Abstract: A central challenge in understanding generalization is to obtain non-vacuous
guarantees that go beyond worst-case complexity over data or weight space.
Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayes bounds stand out as they can provide
tight, data-dependent guarantees even for large networks. However, in ReLU
networks, rescaling invariances mean that different weight distributions can
represent the same function while leading to arbitrarily different PAC-Bayes
complexities. We propose to study PAC-Bayes bounds in an invariant, lifted
representation that resolves this discrepancy. This paper explores both the
guarantees provided by this approach (invariance, tighter bounds via data
processing) and the algorithmic aspects of KL-based rescaling-invariant
PAC-Bayes bounds.

### [642] [Spectral gap of Metropolis-within-Gibbs under log-concavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26175)
*Cecilia Secchi,Giacomo Zanella*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper improves on the theoretical understanding of the Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) algorithm by showing it mixes faster under certain conditions, specifically for log-concave distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in theoretical guarantees for the mixing time of the MwG algorithm, especially with variance-adaptive proposals.

Method: The authors analyzed the spectral gap of the random-scan MwG algorithm, focusing on log-concave distributions, and developed precise conductance estimates for one-dimensional RWM kernels.

Result: They derived a spectral gap lower bound of $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa d)$, improving upon the previous $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa^2 d)$ result, and showed the performance gap between MwG and the exact Gibbs sampler is minimal.

Conclusion: Variance-adaptive proposals can significantly enhance the mixing efficiency of MwG, offering theoretical insights into previously observed empirical results.

Abstract: The Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) algorithm is a widely used Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method for sampling from high-dimensional distributions when exact
conditional sampling is intractable. We study MwG with Random Walk Metropolis
(RWM) updates, using proposal variances tuned to match the target's conditional
variances. Assuming the target $\pi$ is a $d$-dimensional log-concave
distribution with condition number $\kappa$, we establish a spectral gap lower
bound of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa d)$ for the random-scan version of MwG,
improving on the previously available $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa^2 d)$ bound. This
is obtained by developing sharp estimates of the conductance of one-dimensional
RWM kernels, which can be of independent interest. The result shows that MwG
can mix substantially faster with variance-adaptive proposals and that its
mixing performance is just a constant factor worse than that of the exact Gibbs
sampler, thus providing theoretical support to previously observed empirical
behavior.

*Emil Javurek,Valentyn Melnychuk,Jonas Schweisthal,Konstantin Hess,Dennis Frauen,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents the DRQ-learner, a method for predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making with strong theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve prediction of potential outcomes in sequential decision-making to enhance decision-making in personalized medicine, addressing challenges like long horizons and lack of robust theoretical guarantees.

Method: The authors revisit potential outcome prediction in Markov decision processes from a causal inference perspective and propose the DRQ-learner, which incorporates doubly robust properties, Neyman orthogonality, and quasi-oracle efficiency.

Result: The DRQ-learner is shown to be theoretically sound, valid under misspecification, insensitive to nuisance estimation errors, and asymptotically efficient, and it performs better than state-of-the-art baselines in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The DRQ-learner provides a theoretically robust and flexible solution for sequential decision-making, advancing the field by integrating strong guarantees and compatibility with modern machine learning models.

Abstract: Predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making is
central for optimizing therapeutic decisions in personalized medicine (e.g.,
which dosing sequence to give to a cancer patient). However, predicting
potential outcomes over long horizons is notoriously difficult. Existing
methods that break the curse of the horizon typically lack strong theoretical
guarantees such as orthogonality and quasi-oracle efficiency. In this paper, we
revisit the problem of predicting individualized potential outcomes in
sequential decision-making (i.e., estimating Q-functions in Markov decision
processes with observational data) through a causal inference lens. In
particular, we develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for meta-learners
in this setting with a focus on beneficial theoretical properties. As a result,
we yield a novel meta-learner called DRQ-learner and establish that it is: (1)
doubly robust (i.e., valid inference under the misspecification of one of the
nuisances), (2) Neyman-orthogonal (i.e., insensitive to first-order estimation
errors in the nuisance functions), and (3) achieves quasi-oracle efficiency
(i.e., behaves asymptotically as if the ground-truth nuisance functions were
known). Our DRQ-learner is applicable to settings with both discrete and
continuous state spaces. Further, our DRQ-learner is flexible and can be used
together with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We
validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, thereby showing
that our meta-learner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Mary I. Letey,Jacob A. Zavatone-Veth,Yue M. Lu,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores how the structure of pretraining tasks affects generalization in in-context learning, introducing an alignment measure and revealing a specialization-generalization tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the structures in data that enable and influence the robustness of in-context learning in Transformer models.

Method: Derived a solvable model for linear regression with linear attention, providing exact expressions for generalization error under task covariance mismatch, and introduced an alignment measure.

Result: Identified that task alignment predicts ICL performance and revealed a tradeoff where increased pretraining task diversity can either benefit or harm generalization, depending on alignment.

Conclusion: Train-test task alignment is a critical factor for generalization in in-context learning.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a central capability of Transformer models, but
the structures in data that enable its emergence and govern its robustness
remain poorly understood. In this work, we study how the structure of
pretraining tasks governs generalization in ICL. Using a solvable model for ICL
of linear regression by linear attention, we derive an exact expression for ICL
generalization error in high dimensions under arbitrary pretraining-testing
task covariance mismatch. This leads to a new alignment measure that quantifies
how much information about the pretraining task distribution is useful for
inference at test time. We show that this measure directly predicts ICL
performance not only in the solvable model but also in nonlinear Transformers.
Our analysis further reveals a tradeoff between specialization and
generalization in ICL: depending on task distribution alignment, increasing
pretraining task diversity can either improve or harm test performance.
Together, these results identify train-test task alignment as a key determinant
of generalization in ICL.

*Ruibin Chen,Haozhe Lei,Hao Guo,Marco Mezzavilla,Hitesh Poddar,Tomoki Yoshimura,Sundeep Rangan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of predicting achievable rates in multi-band cellular systems with sparse historical data using a transformer-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to support multiple frequency bands in user equipment handsets in constrained form factors, coupled with challenges such as rapid channel variations, hardware limitations, and measurement sparsity.

Method: A transformer-based neural network architecture using asynchronous rate histories as input to predict per-array rate outcomes.

Result: The proposed method outperforms baseline predictors in ray-traced dense urban micro-cellular simulations involving FR1 and FR3 frequency arrays.

Conclusion: This approach enables better-informed band selection under realistic hardware and mobility constraints, addressing challenges in multi-band channel tracking.

Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands
over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3.
These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple
antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality
across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of
antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose
significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper
formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna
arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a
transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as
input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced
simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays,
our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling
more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing weighted sum rates in a MISO downlink wireless network while emphasizing user rate reliability using a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) formulation and develops a novel graph neural network-based solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods often fail to ensure reliable user rates in adverse wireless channel conditions like deep fading. This paper seeks to address the need for risk-averse techniques to maximize user rate reliability.

Method: The authors propose a risk-aggregated formulation leveraging CVaR to tackle rate reliability under channel uncertainty. They integrate this into a WMMSE-like equivalence and introduce {
alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({
alpha}RGNN) as a policy function approximation trained to optimize for adverse conditions.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that {
alpha}RGNN effectively mitigates deep rate fades for individual users and reduces user rate variability, maintaining suitable ergodic performance.

Conclusion: The proposed {
alpha}RGNN approach ensures ultra-reliability in user rates by addressing channel fading risks, establishing a balance between reducing variability and maintaining performance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate
reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex
WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading
uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed
precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design
a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation
(PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to
maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel
realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that
a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and
substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while
retaining adequate ergodic performance.

### [647] [Indoor/Outdoor Spectrum Sharing Enabled by GNSS-based Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26500)
*Hossein Nasiri,Muhammad Iqbal Rochman,Monisha Ghosh*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes leveraging GNSS signals for indoor/outdoor (I/O) device classification in spectrum sharing scenarios, addressing limitations of current methods. GNSS signals, combined with Wi-Fi, improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in spectrum sharing, particularly in ensuring that indoor devices do not interfere with outdoor incumbents. Current solutions lack reliable automatic methods for I/O classification, which this paper aims to develop.

Method: The study explores GNSS signals for I/O device classification, utilizing their natural susceptibility to indoor attenuation. It develops threshold-based and machine learning approaches and evaluates these using datasets from diverse geographic regions. Additionally, it investigates multi-modal data fusion combining GNSS and Wi-Fi signals.

Result: GNSS-based methods outperformed Wi-Fi-only approaches in I/O classification accuracy, especially in new locations. Combining GNSS and Wi-Fi data further improved accuracy, showcasing the advantage of multi-modal data fusion.

Conclusion: GNSS signals provide a robust solution for I/O classification, outperforming traditional methods. Their integration with Wi-Fi data enhances accuracy, making them suitable for advanced spectrum sharing systems.

Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and
commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial
indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to
spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents
can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing,
between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where
unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor
incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no
reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or
outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor
access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and
reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate
indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling
automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To
this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for
I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and
highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and
distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various
methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning
approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse
geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone
can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)
data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of
GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,
showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.

### [648] [Position-Blind Ptychography: Viability of image reconstruction via data-driven variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269)
*Simon Welker,Lorenz Kuger,Tim Roith,Berthy Feng,Martin Burger,Timo Gerkmann,Henry Chapman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores a new blind inverse problem in ptychography where scan positions are unknown, requiring simultaneous reconstruction of both image and positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the challenges in single-particle diffractive X-ray imaging, where beam positions relative to particles are unknown, complicating ptychographic measurements.

Method: The authors use simulated 2-D data and solve the problem through variational inference paired with score-based diffusion models as image priors.

Result: They demonstrate reliable image reconstruction under noise conditions when using appropriate illumination structure and strong priors, except for extremely challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: With suitable techniques and priors, reconstructing images in position-blind ptychography is feasible under most scenarios, opening up possibilities for advancements in X-ray imaging.

Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of
position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any
knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the
image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive
X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set
of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam,
the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to
each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also
unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated,
simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference
with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion
models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior,
one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under
measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

### [649] [Anatomy-DT: A Cross-Diffusion Digital Twin for Anatomical Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25280)
*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework integrating mathematical modeling and deep learning to simulate tumor progression along with changes in surrounding anatomy, yielding anatomically consistent and realistic digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model tumor progression in a way that accounts for the often-overlooked impact on adjacent anatomical structures, thereby achieving a more clinically relevant understanding of disease dynamics.

Method: The paper combines mechanistic partial differential equations (PDE) with deep learning, utilizing a cross-diffusion reaction-diffusion system, implicit-explicit numerical schemes, and topology-regularization techniques.

Result: The methodology achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on synthetic datasets and outperforms existing methods on a clinical dataset, while preserving anatomical consistency and topology.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust path for generating anatomically accurate and topologically consistent digital twins, advancing the ability to predict tumor evolution and simulate disease dynamics for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from
baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that
can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing
approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant
alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is
highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic
interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring
tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction
with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant
understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded
framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with
differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class
probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion
reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and
exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion
implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly,
followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global
plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces
centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is
validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic
benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving
topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset.
By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable
solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy
generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically
exclusive, and topologically consistent.

TL;DR: The study presents an automated pipeline for MRI-based liver fibrosis analysis, achieving excellent performance in the CARE 2025 Challenge using deep learning and STAD features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a non-invasive alternative to invasive methods for precise liver fibrosis staging and diagnosis, minimizing risks and complications.

Method: An automated pipeline integrating pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, deep neural network liver segmentation, and fibrosis staging using STAD features from MRI data.

Result: The pipeline demonstrated excellent generalizability and top-tier performance across all subtasks of the CARE 2025 Challenge using multi-modal MRI data with limited annotations.

Conclusion: This approach offers a reproducible and accurate framework for liver fibrosis quantification, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making while leveraging artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix
caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and
function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise
staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive,
which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent
advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis
staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge
aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in
real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI
data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and
fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for
both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates
pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using
deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural,
appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and
MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our
proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI
modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks.
This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative
MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical
decision-making. Code is available at

*Nagur Shareef Shaik,Teja Krishna Cherukuri,Adnan Masood,Ehsan Adeli,Dong Hye Ye*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAP-WAE, a framework tailored to address challenges in diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading, including ordinal and imbalanced data issues, using novel innovations in autoencoders and loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inherent long-tail distribution and ordinal nature of DR grading while detecting rare but clinically critical minority stages accurately.

Method: The CAP-WAE framework uses a Wasserstein Autoencoder with an asymmetric prior, MAOC loss to improve latent space organization, and a direction-aware ordinal loss to penalize clinically critical misclassifications. An adaptive multi-task weighting scheme stabilizes the model.

Result: CAP-WAE delivers superior performance across DR benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art metrics such as Quadratic Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, while reshaping latent spaces into compact grade-ordered clusters.

Conclusion: CAP-WAE effectively aligns latent representations with ordinal clinical priorities, offering a robust, scalable approach to DR grading with minimal tuning and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with
minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect
accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and
symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's
asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder
(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving
the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is
further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss
to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a
direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric
dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by
penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task
weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public
DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic
Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification
and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our
method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with
reduced overlap.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) for classifying GI tract images, achieving high accuracy on the HyperKvasir dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable early and accurate diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders, leveraging advanced machine learning for better treatment outcomes.

Method: An ensemble of pre-trained ViTs (MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200) is used, evaluated on the HyperKvasir dataset, with interpretability methods like Grad-CAM and SHAP.

Result: The ensemble model (GastroViT) outperforms individual models, achieving up to 92.70% accuracy with high precision, recall, and F1 scores despite dataset imbalance.

Conclusion: The ensemble approach demonstrates strong potential for reliable and interpretable GI diagnosis in clinical settings, even with imbalanced data.

Abstract: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant
mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal
illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly
contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving
therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision
transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI
tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs,
attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by
leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed
model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662
images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract
diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two
pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved
accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are
outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision,
recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in
the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million
(M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly
imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even
higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%,
87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable
AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping)
and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability,
providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.

*Derek Jiu,Kiran Nijjer,Nishant Chinta,Ryan Bui,Ben Liu,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiographic tasks, focusing on the impact of clinically-motivated noise on segmentation and classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the vulnerability of deep learning models in radiographic tasks under different types of clinical noise such as Poisson and Gaussian, providing a systematic cross-task analysis.

Method: A novel noise injection framework was used to introduce controlled noise to deep learning models (like UNet, ResNet, etc.). Two tasks were tested: semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification using public datasets.

Result: Semantic segmentation models showed significant vulnerability to electronic noise, with nearly complete failure under severe conditions. Classification models exhibited better robustness but failed under specific noise types for certain diseases.

Conclusion: Deep learning models for diagnostic AI require targeted validation and mitigation strategies to address task-specific and noise-specific weaknesses before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly used for radiographic analysis, but
their reliability is challenged by the stochastic noise inherent in clinical
imaging. A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types
impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum
(Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks:
semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel,
scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated
noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet,
DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our
results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation
models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing
under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843),
signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks
demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform.
We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as
distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under
quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to
electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models
possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far
more brittle. The task- and noise-specific nature of model failure underscores
the critical need for targeted validation and mitigation strategies before the
safe clinical deployment of diagnostic AI.

Result: Lie symmetry greatly enhances the performance of PINNs when solving PDEs.

Conclusion: Combining PINNs with abstract mathematical concepts like Lie symmetry leads to improved solutions for scientific problems.

Abstract: This paper presents intersection of Physics informed neural networks (PINNs)
and Lie symmetry group to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of solving

solve these equations. A Lie group is an efficient method that can lead to
exact solutions for the PDEs that possessing Lie Symmetry. Leveraging the
concept of infinitesimal generators from Lie symmetry group in a novel manner
within PINN leads to significant improvements in solution of PDEs. In this
study three distinct cases are discussed, each showing progressive improvements
achieved through Lie symmetry modifications and adaptive techniques.
State-of-the-art numerical methods are adopted for comparing the progressive

*Qichen Xu,Anna Delin*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general optimization framework to systematically map energy landscapes, predicting transition mechanisms in complex systems like computational chemistry and physics with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the systematic mapping of energy landscapes in complex systems, which enables better understanding and prediction of transitions, overcoming limitations in current practices.

Method: A multi-objective optimization framework with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel, using Hessian-vector products and a reflected force strategy, paired with a GPU-based pipeline for efficiency.

Result: The framework achieves explicit-Hessian-level accuracy while significantly reducing memory and computational time. It discovers novel mechanisms in skyrmionic models and automates mapping in atomistic systems, demonstrating versatility.

Conclusion: The framework enhances predictive power and generality in energy landscape mapping across various fields, revealing both known and previously unreported transition mechanisms efficiently.

Abstract: Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping
the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state
networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and
enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and
physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples
only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization
framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a
multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer
uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest
k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1
saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based
pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large
atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak
memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized
N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously
unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type
skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up
to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same
core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical
rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper investigates asymptotically optimal tuning parameter selection in ridge regression for estimating conditional independence-related statistical functionals under proportional asymptotic regimes. Bias correction strategies for ECC estimators are developed for optimal $
$-consistency and minimized asymptotic variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To estimate Expected Conditional Covariance (ECC) in high-dimensional settings, especially important in conditional independence testing and causal inference, where obtaining consistent estimators is challenging due to the statistical properties of proportional asymptotic regimes.

Method: The authors derive debiased ECC estimators using ridge regression, evaluate their $
$-consistency, examine the effect of sample splitting strategies and nuisance function tuning parameters on optimal estimation, and provide asymptotic variance calculations.

Result: The debiased estimators achieve $
$-consistency across diverse estimator choices and sample splitting strategies, but prediction-optimal tuning parameters do not necessarily yield minimum asymptotic variance for ECC estimation.

Conclusion: Optimal tuning parameter selection in ridge regression for ECC estimators requires considerations beyond prediction accuracy, as the interplay between tuning, sample splitting, and bias correction affects asymptotic variance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the asymptotically optimal tuning parameter choice
in ridge regression for estimating nuisance functions of a statistical
functional that has recently gained prominence in conditional independence
testing and causal inference. Given a sample of size $n$, we study estimators
of the Expected Conditional Covariance (ECC) between variables $Y$ and $A$
given a high-dimensional covariate $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$. Under linear
regression models for $Y$ and $A$ on $X$ and the proportional asymptotic regime
$p/n \to c \in (0, \infty)$, we evaluate three existing ECC estimators and two
sample splitting strategies for estimating the required nuisance functions.
Since no consistent estimator of the nuisance functions exists in the
proportional asymptotic regime without imposing further structure on the
problem, we first derive debiased versions of the ECC estimators that utilize
the ridge regression nuisance function estimators. We show that our bias
correction strategy yields $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimators of the ECC across
different sample splitting strategies and estimator choices. We then derive the
asymptotic variances of these debiased estimators to illustrate the nuanced
interplay between the sample splitting strategy, estimator choice, and tuning
parameters of the nuisance function estimators for optimally estimating the
ECC. Our analysis reveals that prediction-optimal tuning parameters (i.e.,
those that optimally estimate the nuisance functions) may not lead to the
lowest asymptotic variance of the ECC estimator -- thereby demonstrating the
need to be careful in selecting tuning parameters based on the final goal of
inference. Finally, we verify our theoretical results through extensive
numerical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm to compute Nash equilibrium in multiplayer imperfect-information games, outperforming previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms either lack scalability to large games or fail to guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer scenarios.

Method: The authors solve a quadratically-constrained program using nonlinear complementarity problem formulations in sequence-form representations.

Result: Their algorithm successfully and efficiently solves problems like three-player Kuhn poker, outperforming existing methods such as Gambit's logit quantal response approach.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is a significant improvement in both efficiency and accuracy for solving Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games, leveraging advanced optimization techniques.

Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of
Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and
exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games.
While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to
large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they
do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We
present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer
imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program
based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form
game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving
nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve
three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available
algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response
approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes
longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our
formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in
multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous
quadratically-constrained program formulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MR$^2$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for multimodal retrieval only assess surface-level semantic correspondence, lacking the depth needed for complex relationships between visual and textual data.

Method: They developed MR$^2$-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning-intensive tasks through logical, spatial, and causal inference using diverse multimodal data and complex queries.

Result: State-of-the-art models, such as Seed1.6-Embedding, performed poorly on MR$^2$-Bench compared to existing benchmarks, with a Recall@1 score dropping from 77.78 to 9.91.

Conclusion: MR$^2$-Bench presents a more challenging and realistic evaluation for multimodal retrieval, emphasizing the need for advanced models capable of deeper reasoning. The dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores Transformer models for understanding financial transactions, comparing pretrained, fine-tuned, and proprietary models. Proprietary decoder-only models outperformed general-purpose LLMs in speed, cost efficiency, and real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The analysis of financial transactions is essential for regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and decision-making. The complexity of transaction data requires advanced techniques for meaningful insights.

Method: The paper evaluates three Transformer model types—Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder—considering pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and proprietary models developed from scratch.

Result: Large language models like LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT showed impressive performance but did not significantly outpace small proprietary models, which are faster, cost-efficient, and better for real-time needs.

Conclusion: Proprietary models tailored for financial transaction data are better suited for real-time applications. The customized decoder-only model improved transaction coverage by 14% and saved $13 million annually, highlighting domain-specific model advantages.

Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory
compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of
financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract
meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based
models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper
seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This
paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer
models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,
we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small
proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while
LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive
capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not
significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of
financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in
terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique
requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower
operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the
financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection
based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of
customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized
applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only
model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.
This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than
\$13 million annual cost.

### [662] [RAE: A Neural Network Dimensionality Reduction Method for Nearest Neighbors Preservation in Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25839)
*Han Zhang,Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE), a dimensionality reduction method to preserve k-nearest neighbor relationships while improving retrieval efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional embedding vectors are increasingly used, but popular dimensionality reduction methods like PCA and UMAP struggle to preserve nearest-neighbor relationships, limiting their application in retrieval tasks.

Method: The authors propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) that uses neural networks optimized with regularization. They constrain parameter variations and adjust singular values to reduce embedding dimensions while ensuring k-NN relationship preservation.

Result: RAE demonstrates superior k-NN recall compared to conventional methods with minimal training overhead and ensures faster retrieval efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed RAE method provides a provable guarantee for preserving k-NN relationships and offers practical efficiency improvements for retrieval tasks.

Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

*Victor Sechaud,Patrice Abry,Laurent Jacques,Julián Tachella*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper discusses a self-supervised method for phase retrieval in imaging that eliminates the necessity of reference images by exploiting images' natural translational invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of fully sampled 'ground truth' data limits supervised learning in medical and scientific imaging, especially for non-linear problems like phase retrieval.

Method: A self-supervised learning approach is proposed that leverages the translational invariance property of images to address phase retrieval challenges without requiring reference data.

Result: The method succeeds in extending capabilities to non-linear problems in image reconstruction, such as phase retrieval, previously limited by a lack of ground truth references.

Conclusion: The study advances imaging techniques by introducing a self-supervised framework that addresses non-linear issues like phase retrieval, offering a reference-free solution using image translation invariance.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a solution for inverse
imaging problems. These networks are generally trained using pairs of images:
one degraded and the other of high quality, the latter being called 'ground
truth'. However, in medical and scientific imaging, the lack of fully sampled
data limits supervised learning. Recent advances have made it possible to
reconstruct images from measurement data alone, eliminating the need for
references. However, these methods remain limited to linear problems, excluding
non-linear problems such as phase retrieval. We propose a self-supervised
method that overcomes this limitation in the case of phase retrieval by using
the natural invariance of images to translations.

*Conghao Zhou,Jie Gao,Shisheng Hu,Nan Cheng,Weihua Zhuang,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a digital twin-based approach for optimizing edge-assisted mobile augmented reality (MAR) communication in future 6G networks, focusing on adaptive and user-specific data traffic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAR in 6G networks requires efficient communication to ensure timely pose tracking for immersive experiences, which necessitates addressing challenges related to non-stationary and user-specific uplink data traffic.

Method: The authors establish digital twins for MAR devices with customized data models and adaptive operational functions to manage non-stationary traffic. They further devise an algorithm for dynamic network resource management.

Result: Trace-driven simulations reveal a 14.2% improvement in adhering to camera frame uploading delay requirements compared to traditional slicing-based communication used in 5G.

Conclusion: Using digital twins for user-centric management significantly improves performance in edge-assisted MAR scenarios, motivating their adoption for future 6G applications.

Abstract: Future 6G networks are envisioned to facilitate edge-assisted mobile
augmented reality (MAR) via strengthening the collaboration between MAR devices
and edge servers. In order to provide immersive user experiences, MAR devices
must timely upload camera frames to an edge server for simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM)-based device pose tracking. In this paper, to
cope with user-specific and non-stationary uplink data traffic, we develop a
digital twin (DT)-based approach for user-centric communication service
provision for MAR. Specifically, to establish DTs for individual MAR devices,
we first construct a data model customized for MAR that captures the intricate
impact of the SLAM-based frame uploading mechanism on the user-specific data
traffic pattern. We then define two DT operation functions that cooperatively
enable adaptive switching between different data-driven models for capturing
non-stationary data traffic. Leveraging the user-oriented data management
introduced by DTs, we propose an algorithm for network resource management that
ensures the timeliness of frame uploading and the robustness against inherent
inaccuracies in data traffic modeling for individual MAR devices. Trace-driven
simulation results demonstrate that the user-centric communication service
provision achieves a 14.2% increase in meeting the camera frame uploading delay
requirement in comparison with the slicing-based communication service
provision widely used for 5G.

*Hatim Chergui,Miguel Catalan Cid,Pouria Sayyad Khodashenas,Daniel Camps Mur,Christos Verikoukis*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for resource management in 6G networks using LLM-augmented agents with a focus on reducing negotiation biases and improving system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges related to cognitive distortions in decision-making for resource orchestration in 6G networks and to improve reliability and efficiency.

Method: The framework uses LLM-augmented agents that interact with a digital twin and a collective memory system. Strategies addressing past negotiation biases, such as recency, availability, and confirmation biases, are employed.

Result: The proposed unbiased memory design reduced negotiation failures by 4.5x compared to no memory, and 3.5x compared to standard memory approaches, while fully mitigating SLA violations and enhancing latency and energy savings.

Conclusion: The unbiased memory design effectively minimizes cognitive biases, improving the robustness of decision-making in 6G RAN-Edge networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for proactive cross-domain resource
orchestration in 6G RAN-Edge networks, featuring large language model
(LLM)-augmented agents. The system comprises specialized RAN (energy
efficiency) and Edge (latency assurance) agents that engage in iterative
negotiation, supported by advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. Agents
dynamically interact with a digital twin (DT) to test their proposals and
leverage a long-term collective memory where their joint successful and failed
agreements along with the related network contexts are distilled into
strategies to either follow or avoid and subsequently stored. Given that agents
are subject to a plethora of cognitive distortions when retrieving those past
experiences -- such as primacy, recency, confirmation and availability biases
-- we propose in this work a novel unbiased memory design (A reusable mockup
version of the unbiased memory source code is available for non-commercial use
at https://github.com/HatimChergui/unbiased-collective-memory). featuring (i)
semantic retrieval of past strategies via Jaccard similarity; (ii) learning
from failures through amplified weighting of SLA violations and mandatory
inclusion of failed negotiation cases to mitigate confirmation bias; (iii)
diversity enforcement to minimize availability bias and (iv) recency and
primacy weighting with slow decay to counteract temporal biases. Evaluation
results showcase the impact of existing biases and how the unbiased memory
allows to tackle them by learning from both successful and failed strategies,
either present or old, resulting in $\times 4.5$ and $\times 3.5$ reductions of
unresolved negotiations compared to non-memory and vanilla memory baselines,
respectively, while totally mitigating SLA violations as well as improving
latency and energy saving distributions.

*Sven Dummer,Tjeerd Jan Heeringa,José A. Iglesias*

Main category: math.FA

TL;DR: This paper develops a general framework for vector-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces (vv-RKBS) to understand the function spaces underlying neural networks and neural operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work has focused on scalar-valued function spaces for neural networks, while vector-valued neural architectures and neural operators remain poorly understood, particularly in the RKBS context.

Method: A novel definition of vv-RKBS is proposed, avoiding previous restrictive assumptions. The authors analyze shallow and deep $\R^d$-valued neural networks and neural operators such as DeepONet and Hypernetwork to show they belong to this vv-RKBS framework.

Result: Shallow $\R^d$-valued networks, DeepONet, and Hypernetwork architectures are demonstrated to reside within the integral and neural vv-RKBS while satisfying a Representer Theorem, linking optimization to corresponding neural architectures.

Conclusion: The study generalizes the understanding of neural network and operator function spaces by introducing vv-RKBS, offering theoretical guarantees and insights applicable across various neural network models.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in characterizing the function
spaces underlying neural networks. While shallow and deep scalar-valued neural
networks have been linked to scalar-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces
(RKBS), $\R^d$-valued neural networks and neural operator models remain less
understood in the RKBS setting. To address this gap, we develop a general
definition of vector-valued RKBS (vv-RKBS), which inherently includes the
associated reproducing kernel. Our construction extends existing definitions by
avoiding restrictive assumptions such as symmetric kernel domains,
finite-dimensional output spaces, reflexivity, or separability, while still
recovering familiar properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (vv-RKHS). We then show that shallow $\R^d$-valued neural networks are
elements of a specific vv-RKBS, namely an instance of the integral and neural
vv-RKBS. To also explore the functional structure of neural operators, we
analyze the DeepONet and Hypernetwork architectures and demonstrate that they
too belong to an integral and neural vv-RKBS. In all cases, we establish a
Representer Theorem, showing that optimization over these function spaces
recovers the corresponding neural architectures.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper addresses redundant computations in LLMs by introducing AdaptCache, a system for lossy KV cache compression to optimize loading delays and storage use without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LLM applications has led to large KV cache storage requirements, and existing systems relying on DRAM and SSD suffer from high delay issues, especially with SSD access.

Method: The proposed method, AdaptCache, uses a lossy compression system that dynamically selects compression algorithms, rates, and storage placements to optimize DRAM hits and minimize loading delays while preserving output quality.

Result: AdaptCache outperformed static compression baselines, achieving 1.43–2.4x delay reduction for the same quality and 6–55% quality improvements at the same delay across three tasks.

Conclusion: AdaptCache effectively reduces loading delays for redundant LLM computations by smartly compressing KV caches, making it a significant step forward for scalable LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications often reuse previously processed
context, such as chat history and documents, which introduces significant
redundant computation. Existing LLM serving systems address such redundant
computation by storing the KV caches of processed context and loading the
corresponding KV cache when a new request reuses the context. Further, as these
LLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large
and requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.
  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high
loading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load. To
increase the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression
as a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the
compression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache
entry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly
degrading generation quality. Compared to various static compression baselines
across three tasks, our system AdaptCache achieves 1.43--2.4 x delay savings at
the same quality and 6--55% quality improvements at the same delay.

*Yuepeng Hu,Zhengyuan Jiang,Mengyuan Li,Osama Ahmed,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Neil Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLMPrint, a framework for detecting whether a large language model (LLM) is derived from another, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining the provenance of LLMs is challenging, especially when models are modified post-release. Current methods are inadequate for already-published or post-processed models.

Method: The proposed method, LLMPrint, uses the inherent vulnerability of LLMs to prompt injection to create robust and unique 'fingerprints' that work across gray-box and black-box scenarios with statistical guarantees.

Result: LLMPrint was evaluated on five base models and 700 post-processed variants, achieving high true positive rates and near-zero false positives.

Conclusion: LLMPrint is an effective and reliable framework for model provenance detection, even in the context of post-processing like quantization or post-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through
post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it
challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing
provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals
into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published
models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random
prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose
LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by
exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is
that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences,
we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to
post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that
applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees.
We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or
quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive
rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel attack framework called Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC) that targets tool-enabled autonomous AI agents, demonstrating their vulnerabilities and proposing a defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs) as tool-using autonomous agents, new security concerns arise. Traditional content-focused safety measures are insufficient for safeguarding multi-step, tool-using capabilities, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.

Method: The authors developed the STAC framework, which chains seemingly harmless tool calls into harmful operations. They automatically generated and tested 483 STAC cases involving 1,352 sets of interactions across various domains. The framework includes a closed-loop pipeline to synthesize, validate, and reverse-engineer attack scenarios.

Result: Evaluations revealed that leading LLM agents like GPT-4.1 have over 90% attack success rates (ASR) against STAC in most scenarios. Existing defenses provided limited protection, while the proposed reasoning-driven defense reduced ASR by up to 28.8%.

Conclusion: The findings reveal that protecting tool-enabled AI agents requires analyzing full action sequences rather than isolated events. Robust reasoning defenses are critical for mitigating vulnerabilities introduced by autonomous, tool-using AI systems.

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire
action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated
prompts or responses.

*Yao Tong,Haonan Wang,Siquan Li,Kenji Kawaguchi,Tianyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeedPrints, a fingerprinting method for large language models that utilizes random initialization biases as persistent identifiers, effective across training stages and robust against disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable verification of model lineage and attribution, alongside limitations in existing post-hoc fingerprinting methods for large language models.

Method: SeedPrints uses token selection biases derived from random initialization parameters, detectable before training begins and stable throughout the model lifecycle.

Result: SeedPrints successfully identifies models’ lineage with high confidence under domain shifts, training stages, and parameter modifications, verified through experiments on LLaMA- and Qwen-style models.

Conclusion: Random initialization biases can serve as unique fingerprints for large language models, ensuring reliable identity verification throughout the model lifecycle.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance
verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc
signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters --
properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a
stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method
that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent
identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit
reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at
initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training,
enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with
high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and
vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all
training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications.
Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves
seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity
verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale
pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its
effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that
initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural
language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy concerns in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly focusing on Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage, proposing a concept-guided approach to mitigate such risks in vision-language models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate privacy vulnerabilities in multimodal models, especially concerning PII leakage, and bridge the research gap which previously focused primarily on single-modal language models.

Method: The authors propose a concept-guided mitigation method that modifies the internal states of VLMs associated with PII content without requiring re-training or fine-tuning. They also construct multimodal PII datasets to simulate real-world scenarios.

Result: Their approach achieves an average refusal rate of 93.3% for tasks involving PII, with minimal negative impact on the model's performances on unrelated tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates PII-related risks in VLMs, demonstrating adaptability under varying conditions and addressing a critical privacy concern in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in processing and reasoning over diverse modalities, but their
advanced abilities also raise significant privacy concerns, particularly
regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. While relevant
research has been conducted on single-modal language models to some extent, the
vulnerabilities in the multimodal setting have yet to be fully investigated. In
this work, we investigate these emerging risks with a focus on vision language
models (VLMs), a representative subclass of MLLMs that covers the two
modalities most relevant for PII leakage, vision and text. We introduce a
concept-guided mitigation approach that identifies and modifies the model's
internal states associated with PII-related content. Our method guides VLMs to
refuse PII-sensitive tasks effectively and efficiently, without requiring
re-training or fine-tuning. We also address the current lack of multimodal PII
datasets by constructing various ones that simulate real-world scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that the method can achieve an average refusal
rate of 93.3% for various PII-related tasks with minimal impact on unrelated
model performances. We further examine the mitigation's performance under
various conditions to show the adaptability of our proposed method.

*Dennis Jacob,Emad Alghamdi,Zhanhao Hu,Basel Alomair,David Wagner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to prompt injections and proposes a method called type-directed privilege separation to systematically prevent such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used for interacting with unstructured content, but they are susceptible to prompt injections where adversaries compromise their intended functionality. Existing solutions are inadequate against adaptive attacks or incompatible with state-of-the-art models.

Method: The paper introduces type-directed privilege separation, which restricts LLM interactions with third-party data by converting untrusted content into specific, limited data types, thereby eliminating prompt injection risks.

Result: The proposed method was evaluated through case studies, demonstrating that it can systematically prevent prompt injection attacks while maintaining high utility.

Conclusion: Type-directed privilege separation offers a robust solution to prevent prompt injections in LLMs, enhancing security without sacrificing their utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular due to their
ability to interact with unstructured content. As such, LLMs are now a key
driver behind the automation of language processing systems, such as AI agents.
Unfortunately, these advantages have come with a vulnerability to prompt
injections, an attack where an adversary subverts the LLM's intended
functionality with an injected task. Past approaches have proposed detectors
and finetuning to provide robustness, but these techniques are vulnerable to
adaptive attacks or cannot be used with state-of-the-art models. To this end we
propose type-directed privilege separation for LLMs, a method that
systematically prevents prompt injections. We restrict the ability of an LLM to
interact with third-party data by converting untrusted content to a curated set
of data types; unlike raw strings, each data type is limited in scope and
content, eliminating the possibility for prompt injections. We evaluate our
method across several case studies and find that designs leveraging our
principles can systematically prevent prompt injection attacks while
maintaining high utility.

TL;DR: The study introduces a structured adversarial threat model for DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT networks, categorizes attack types, evaluates their impacts across datasets, and proposes adaptive countermeasures to enhance security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL-based AAD systems for SDN-IoT networks face significant challenges from adversarial attacks that degrade detection accuracy and security.

Method: The paper systematically categorizes adversarial attacks into data, model, and hybrid-level threats, evaluates these attacks across white, black, and grey-box strategies using benchmark datasets, and proposes structured threat models and countermeasures.

Result: Adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by up to 48.4%, with membership inference causing the most significant drop, while adversarial training improves robustness but is computationally expensive.

Conclusion: This study highlights vulnerabilities in DL-based AAD systems, provides practical countermeasure strategies like adaptive retraining and real-time mitigation, and offers a foundational reference for improving SDN-IoT network security.

Abstract: Integrating SDN and the IoT enhances network control and flexibility.
DL-based AAD systems improve security by enabling real-time threat detection in
SDN-IoT networks. However, these systems remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that manipulate input data or exploit model weaknesses, significantly
degrading detection accuracy. Existing research lacks a systematic analysis of
adversarial vulnerabilities specific to DL-based AAD systems in SDN-IoT
environments. This SoK study introduces a structured adversarial threat model
and a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks, categorising them into data, model,
and hybrid-level threats. Unlike previous studies, we systematically evaluate
white, black, and grey-box attack strategies across popular benchmark datasets.
Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks can reduce detection accuracy by
up to 48.4%, with Membership Inference causing the most significant drop. C&W
and DeepFool achieve high evasion success rates. However, adversarial training
enhances robustness, and its high computational overhead limits the real-time
deployment of SDN-IoT applications. We propose adaptive countermeasures,
including real-time adversarial mitigation, enhanced retraining mechanisms, and
explainable AI-driven security frameworks. By integrating structured threat
models, this study offers a more comprehensive approach to attack
categorisation, impact assessment, and defence evaluation than previous
research. Our work highlights critical vulnerabilities in existing DL-based AAD
models and provides practical recommendations for improving resilience,
interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study serves as a
foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance
DL-based AAD security in SDN-IoT networks, offering a systematic adversarial
threat model and conceptual defence evaluation based on prior empirical
studies.

### [674] [DeepProv: Behavioral Characterization and Repair of Neural Networks via Inference Provenance Graph Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26562)
*Firas Ben Hmida,Abderrahmen Amich,Ata Kaboudi,Birhanu Eshete*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DeepProv is introduced as a system to monitor and enhance deep neural networks using Inference Provenance Graphs, targeting robustness, privacy, and fairness in DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unpredictable behaviors of DNNs in real-world applications necessitate new techniques to ensure their reliability in areas like self-driving and biometric authentication.

Method: DeepProv models DNN runtime behaviors using Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs), which map computational flow during inference. It then repairs DNNs based on objectives such as robustness by identifying actions at node and edge levels.

Result: DeepProv improves adversarial robustness, achieving an average 55% increase in adversarial accuracy for single-layer repairs, and complements existing defenses across various classification tasks and attack scenarios.

Conclusion: DeepProv proves effective not only in improving DNN robustness but also as a versatile tool for analyzing DNN behavior in privacy and fairness domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes
applications, from self-driving cars to biometric authentication. However,
their unpredictable and unreliable behaviors in real-world settings require new
approaches to characterize and ensure their reliability.
  This paper introduces DeepProv, a novel and customizable system designed to
capture and characterize the runtime behavior of DNNs during inference by using
their underlying graph structure. Inspired by system audit provenance graphs,
DeepProv models the computational information flow of a DNN's inference process
through Inference Provenance Graphs (IPGs). These graphs provide a detailed
structural representation of the behavior of DNN, allowing both empirical and
structural analysis. DeepProv uses these insights to systematically repair DNNs
for specific objectives, such as improving robustness, privacy, or fairness.
  We instantiate DeepProv with adversarial robustness as the goal of model
repair and conduct extensive case studies to evaluate its effectiveness. Our
results demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability across diverse
classification tasks, attack scenarios, and model complexities. DeepProv
automatically identifies repair actions at the node and edge-level within IPGs,
significantly enhancing the robustness of the model. In particular, applying
DeepProv repair strategies to just a single layer of a DNN yields an average
55% improvement in adversarial accuracy. Moreover, DeepProv complements
existing defenses, achieving substantial gains in adversarial robustness.
Beyond robustness, we demonstrate the broader potential of DeepProv as an
adaptable system to characterize DNN behavior in other critical areas, such as
privacy auditing and fairness analysis.

### [675] [Are Robust LLM Fingerprints Adversarially Robust?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26598)
*Anshul Nasery,Edoardo Contente,Alkin Kaz,Pramod Viswanath,Sewoong Oh*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This work critically evaluates the robustness of model fingerprinting schemes under adversarial threats and demonstrates their vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model fingerprinting schemes lack systematic evaluations for adversarial robustness, leaving them vulnerable to malicious threats.

Method: The paper introduces a practical threat model, identifies vulnerabilities in existing schemes, and develops targeted adversarial attacks for each.

Result: Ten fingerprinting schemes were bypassed through tailored adversarial attacks without compromising model utility.

Conclusion: The study calls for integrating adversarial robustness into fingerprinting schemes and provides recommendations for future research.

Abstract: Model fingerprinting has emerged as a promising paradigm for claiming model
ownership. However, robustness evaluations of these schemes have mostly focused
on benign perturbations such as incremental fine-tuning, model merging, and
prompting. Lack of systematic investigations into {\em adversarial robustness}
against a malicious model host leaves current systems vulnerable. To bridge
this gap, we first define a concrete, practical threat model against model
fingerprinting. We then take a critical look at existing model fingerprinting
schemes to identify their fundamental vulnerabilities. Based on these, we
develop adaptive adversarial attacks tailored for each vulnerability, and
demonstrate that these can bypass model authentication completely for ten
recently proposed fingerprinting schemes while maintaining high utility of the
model for the end users. Our work encourages fingerprint designers to adopt
adversarial robustness by design. We end with recommendations for future
fingerprinting methods.

*Zhenfeng Deng,Ruijie Hou,Ningrui Xie,Mike Tyers,Michał Koziarski*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new epitope-only strategy for de novo protein binder design, improving success rates and computational efficiency, particularly for large targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein binder generation on large or multi-domain targets faces challenges due to computational constraints and reduced success rates. The study aims to address these issues.

Method: The proposed approach focuses on discontinuous surface residues around the binding site, supported by a tailored pipeline with Monte Carlo evolution and position-specific sequence refinement.

Result: The strategy improved design success rates by up to 80% and reduced computation time per design up to forty-fold, enabling efficient binder development for complex targets like ClpP and ALS3.

Conclusion: This framework supports a "local-first" design principle and makes binder design for structurally large targets more feasible and generalizable.

Abstract: Recent advances in structure-based protein design have accelerated de novo
binder generation, yet interfaces on large domains or spanning multiple domains
remain challenging due to high computational cost and declining success with
increasing target size. We hypothesized that protein folding neural networks
(PFNNs) operate in a ``local-first'' manner, prioritizing local interactions
while displaying limited sensitivity to global foldability.Guided by this
hypothesis, we propose an epitope-only strategy that retains only the
discontinuous surface residues surrounding the binding site. Compared to
intact-domain workflows, this approach improves in silico success rates by up
to 80% and reduces the average time per successful design by up to forty-fold,
enabling binder design against previously intractable targets such as ClpP and
ALS3. Building on this foundation, we further developed a tailored pipeline
that incorporates a Monte Carlo-based evolution step to overcome local minima
and a position-specific biased inverse folding step to refine sequence
patterns. Together, these advances not only establish a generalizable framework
for efficient binder design against structurally large and otherwise
inaccessible targets, but also support the broader ``local-first'' hypothesis
as a guiding principle for PFNN-based design.

*Kang Yang,Yifan Liang,Fangkun Liu,Zhenping Xie,Chengshi Zheng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system, LTA-L2S, for Mandarin lip-to-speech synthesis, leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning and a flow-matching model for tone generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin lip-to-speech synthesis is challenging due to complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the importance of lexical tones in communication.

Method: The authors adapted a pre-trained English audio-visual model using cross-lingual transfer learning, added a flow-matching model for F0 contour generation, and refined speech quality via a two-stage training process.

Result: LTA-L2S achieved superior speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy, surpassing existing lip-to-speech methods in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed LTA-L2S method effectively addresses the challenges of Mandarin lip-to-speech synthesis through innovative use of cross-lingual transfer learning and lexical tone modeling.

Abstract: Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge,
hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical
tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware
Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model
adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model
via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only
transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the
Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a
model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance
intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0
contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units,
which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is
then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching
postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods
in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.

*Chi Zhang,Zehua Chen,Kaiwen Zheng,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents VoiceBridge, a system for general speech restoration (GSR) at 48 kHz using latent bridge models (LBMs) with a transformer architecture for reconstructing high-fidelity speech from distorted inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current GSR systems, which typically focus on isolated tasks or operate on small datasets, and to provide a scalable model capable of handling diverse low-quality to high-quality speech restoration tasks.

Method: VoiceBridge compresses speech into latent representations and models diverse LQ-to-HQ tasks using latent-to-latent generative processes under a scalable transformer framework. It also employs an energy-preserving variational autoencoder for better data-latent alignment, a joint neural prior for handling diverse inputs, and a perceptually aware fine-tuning stage for quality enhancement.

Result: VoiceBridge demonstrates superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, showcasing its ability to refine zero-shot speech and podcast generation results. Validation revealed improved perceptual and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: VoiceBridge extends the capabilities of bridge models to full-band GSR tasks at scale while maintaining high perceptual quality and handling diverse speech distortions efficiently.

Abstract: Bridge models have recently been explored for speech enhancement tasks such
as denoising, dereverberation, and super-resolution, while these efforts are
typically confined to a single task or small-scale datasets, with constrained
general speech restoration (GSR) capability at scale. In this work, we
introduce VoiceBridge, a GSR system rooted in latent bridge models (LBMs),
capable of reconstructing high-fidelity speech at full-band (\textit{i.e.,}
48~kHz) from various distortions. By compressing speech waveform into
continuous latent representations, VoiceBridge models the~\textit{diverse
LQ-to-HQ tasks} (namely, low-quality to high-quality) in GSR with~\textit{a
single latent-to-latent generative process} backed by a scalable transformer
architecture. To better inherit the advantages of bridge models from the data
domain to the latent space, we present an energy-preserving variational
autoencoder, enhancing the alignment between the waveform and latent space over
varying energy levels. Furthermore, to address the difficulty of HQ
reconstruction from distinctively different LQ priors, we propose a joint
neural prior, uniformly alleviating the reconstruction burden of LBM. At last,
considering the key requirement of GSR systems, human perceptual quality, a
perceptually aware fine-tuning stage is designed to mitigate the cascading
mismatch in generation while improving perceptual alignment. Extensive
validation across in-domain and out-of-domain tasks and datasets
(\textit{e.g.}, refining recent zero-shot speech and podcast generation
results) demonstrates the superior performance of VoiceBridge. Demo samples can

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper explores designing a musical agent using AI by training it to establish relationships between live inputs and real-time outputs through track databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a system capable of generating musically coherent outputs responsive to live inputs using artificial intelligence algorithms.

Method: The paper integrates a symbolic decision module leveraging Transformers with Wav2Vec 2.0 for perception and concatenative synthesis for rendering.

Result: The decision module effectively reproduced learned relationships, predicting coherent outputs conditioned on input tracks with paired examples.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrated strong capabilities in achieving its goal, paving the way for advanced musical agents leveraging AI for dynamic real-time interaction.

Abstract: This paper presents the first step in a research project situated within the
field of musical agents. The objective is to achieve, through training, the
tuning of the desired musical relationship between a live musical input and a
real-time generated musical output, through the curation of a database of
separated tracks. We propose an architecture integrating a symbolic decision
module capable of learning and exploiting musical relationships from such
musical corpus. We detail an offline implementation of this architecture
employing Transformers as the decision module, associated with a perception
module based on Wav2Vec 2.0, and concatenative synthesis as audio renderer. We
present a quantitative evaluation of the decision module's ability to reproduce
learned relationships extracted during training. We demonstrate that our
decision module can predict a coherent track B when conditioned by its
corresponding ''guide'' track A, based on a corpus of paired tracks (A, B).

*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Emo-TTA, a training-free adaptation framework for speech emotion recognition that improves accuracy in out-of-domain scenarios without altering model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in audio-language models for speech emotion recognition, which underperform under distribution shifts at test time.

Method: Emo-TTA applies an Expectation-Maximization procedure to update class-conditional statistics during test time, leveraging predictions from audio-language models as priors.

Result: Experiments on six out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrated that Emo-TTA consistently improves accuracy over existing test-time adaptation baselines.

Conclusion: Statistical adaptation via Emo-TTA provides an effective test-time solution to align model predictions with evolving data distributions, enhancing robustness without model retraining.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) with audio-language models (ALMs) remains
vulnerable to distribution shifts at test time, leading to performance
degradation in out-of-domain scenarios. Test-time adaptation (TTA) provides a
promising solution but often relies on gradient-based updates or prompt tuning,
limiting flexibility and practicality. We propose Emo-TTA, a lightweight,
training-free adaptation framework that incrementally updates class-conditional
statistics via an Expectation-Maximization procedure for explicit test-time
distribution estimation, using ALM predictions as priors. Emo-TTA operates on
individual test samples without modifying model weights. Experiments on six
out-of-domain SER benchmarks show consistent accuracy improvements over prior
TTA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of statistical adaptation in
aligning model predictions with evolving test distributions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces HNote, a novel music notation system optimized for large language models, achieving strong coherence and correctness in music generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing music formats like MIDI or MusicXML are too complex or inconsistent for token-based language models.

Method: A new hexadecimal-based notation system (HNote) was developed and integrated with LLaMA-3.1(8B) using parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: HNote achieved 82.5% syntactic correctness and strong symbolic/structural similarity in stylistically coherent music generation.

Conclusion: HNote is an effective bridge for connecting LLMs to the domain of cultural music modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new
opportunities for symbolic music generation. However, existing formats such as
MIDI, ABC, and MusicXML are either overly complex or structurally inconsistent,
limiting their suitability for token-based learning architectures. To address
these challenges, we propose HNote, a novel hexadecimal-based notation system
extended from YNote, which encodes both pitch and duration within a fixed
32-unit measure framework. This design ensures alignment, reduces ambiguity,
and is directly compatible with LLM architectures. We converted 12,300
Jiangnan-style songs generated from traditional folk pieces from YNote into
HNote, and fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1(8B) using parameter-efficient LoRA.
Experimental results show that HNote achieves a syntactic correctness rate of
82.5%, and BLEU and ROUGE evaluations demonstrate strong symbolic and
structural similarity, producing stylistically coherent compositions. This
study establishes HNote as an effective framework for integrating LLMs with
cultural music modeling.

### [682] [OWL: Geometry-Aware Spatial Reasoning for Audio Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26140)
*Subrata Biswas,Mohammad Nur Hossain Khan,Bashima Islam*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a geometry-aware audio encoder, and OWL, an audio large language model, to improve spatial reasoning in binaural audio setups. Compared to previous methods, these improve direction-of-arrival estimation accuracy and multi-step spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio large language models struggle with perceptual accuracy in spatial reasoning due to reliance on unstructured binaural cues and single-step inference. Existing models use coarse labels and lack geometric supervision, limiting resolution and robustness.

Method: The authors propose SAGE, aligning binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial geometry, trained with panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses. They further integrate SAGE into OWL, which employs spatially grounded chain-of-thought reasoning for multi-step direction-of-arrival and distance estimates. A large-scale dataset, BiDepth, is also constructed for training and evaluation.

Result: The proposed OWL model, utilizing SAGE, reduces mean direction-of-arrival error by 11°, and improves spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to 25% compared to existing models like BAT, as validated on benchmark datasets including BiDepth and SpatialSoundQA.

Conclusion: By introducing SAGE and OWL, the paper advances spatial reasoning in auditory perception, demonstrating higher resolution and interpretability in tasks involving direction and distance estimation. These developments provide a significant accuracy and reasoning improvement compared to previous methodologies.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is fundamental to auditory perception, yet current audio
large language models (ALLMs) largely rely on unstructured binaural cues and
single step inference. This limits both perceptual accuracy in direction and
distance estimation and the capacity for interpretable reasoning. Recent work
such as BAT demonstrates spatial QA with binaural audio, but its reliance on
coarse categorical labels (left, right, up, down) and the absence of explicit
geometric supervision constrain resolution and robustness. We introduce the
$\textbf{Spatial-Acoustic Geometry Encoder (SAGE}$), a geometry-aware audio
encoder that aligns binaural acoustic features with 3D spatial structure using
panoramic depth images and room-impulse responses at training time, while
requiring only audio at inference. Building on this representation, we present
$\textbf{OWL}$, an ALLM that integrates $\textbf{SAGE}$ with a spatially
grounded chain-of-thought to rationalize over direction-of-arrivals (DoA) and
distance estimates. Through curriculum learning from perceptual QA to
multi-step reasoning, $\textbf{OWL}$ supports o'clock-level azimuth and DoA
estimation. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we construct and
release $\textbf{BiDepth}$, a dataset of over one million QA pairs combining
binaural audio with panoramic depth images and room impulse responses across
both in-room and out-of-room scenarios. Across two benchmark datasets, our new
$\textbf{BiDepth}$ and the public SpatialSoundQA, $\textbf{OWL}$ reduces mean
DoA error by $\textbf{11$^{\circ}$}$ through $\textbf{SAGE}$ and improves
spatial reasoning QA accuracy by up to $\textbf{25}$\% over BAT.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper evaluates five modern speaker diarization models using multilingual audio data across diverse settings, identifying PyannoteAI as the best performer and revealing key failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address limitations in speaker diarization systems due to the impact of their errors on downstream applications.

Method: The researchers benchmarked five state-of-the-art diarization models on four datasets with 196.6 hours of multilingual audio in varying languages and acoustic conditions.

Result: PyannoteAI achieved the best performance with 11.2% DER, followed by DiariZen at 13.3% DER. Errors were mainly due to missed speech and speaker confusion, especially in high-speaker count conditions.

Conclusion: Significant improvements are needed in diarization models to address common failure modes for better downstream system reliability.

Abstract: Speaker diarization is the task of partitioning audio into segments according
to speaker identity, answering the question of "who spoke when" in
multi-speaker conversation recordings. While diarization is an essential task
for many downstream applications, it remains an unsolved problem. Errors in
diarization propagate to downstream systems and cause wide-ranging failures. To
this end, we examine exact failure modes by evaluating five state-of-the-art
diarization models, across four diarization datasets spanning multiple
languages and acoustic conditions. The evaluation datasets consist of 196.6
hours of multilingual audio, including English, Mandarin, German, Japanese, and
Spanish. Overall, we find that PyannoteAI achieves the best performance at
11.2% DER, while DiariZen provides a competitive open-source alternative at
13.3% DER. When analyzing failure cases, we find that the primary cause of
diarization errors stem from missed speech segments followed by speaker
confusion, especially in high-speaker count settings.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pruning technique for attention mechanisms in Transformer-based models, aiming to reduce parameter count while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer-based models, despite their high performance, require a large number of parameters, which makes them hardware-intensive during training and inference.

Method: The paper introduces a decoupled pruning method for attention layers, targeting specific components like query, key, value, and output projection matrices. It also examines pruning both head and channel dimensions and evaluates the impact on the AST model.

Result: The technique allows for pruning 50% of the attention parameters while limiting performance degradation to less than 1%.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning method effectively balances parameter reduction with minimal impact on model performance, making Transformers more hardware-efficient.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become the state of the art across multiple
domains, from natural language processing to machine listening, thanks to
attention mechanisms. However, the attention layers require a large number of
parameters and high-end hardware for both training and inference. We propose a
novel pruning technique targeted explicitly at the attention mechanism, where
we decouple the pruning of the four layers in the attention block, namely:
query, keys, values and outputs' projection matrices. We also investigate
pruning strategies to prune along the head and channel dimensions, and compare
the performance of the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model under
different pruning scenarios. Our results show that even by pruning 50\% of the
attention parameters we incur in performance degradation of less than 1\%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality issues such as label errors and duplicate samples negatively impact audio systems, necessitating an efficient method to identify and address these issues.

Method: The paper adapts the SelfClean framework from images to audio, utilizing self-supervised audio representations to rank and surface data quality issues from a unified process.

Result: Benchmarking on ESC-50, GTZAN, and an industrial dataset showed state-of-the-art performance, surpassing conventional approaches for identifying data quality problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively identifies diverse audio data issues and optimizes annotation efforts, offering significant efficiency and performance improvements.

Abstract: Data quality issues such as off-topic samples, near duplicates, and label
errors often limit the performance of audio-based systems. This paper addresses
these issues by adapting SelfClean, a representation-to-rank data auditing
framework, from the image to the audio domain. This approach leverages
self-supervised audio representations to identify common data quality issues,
creating ranked review lists that surface distinct issues within a single,
unified process. The method is benchmarked on the ESC-50, GTZAN, and a
proprietary industrial dataset, using both synthetic and naturally occurring
corruptions. The results demonstrate that this framework achieves

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUSE-Explainer, an interpretable system for music Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using counterfactual explanations to clarify decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many deep learning models for symbolic music analysis focus heavily on performance, neglecting the explainability aspect, which is critical for deployment and understanding.

Method: MUSE-Explainer generates counterfactual explanations by applying small, meaningful modifications to musical score graphs, ensuring the model's predictions change while maintaining musical coherence.

Result: The proposed method is evaluated on a music analysis task, successfully offering intuitive insights that are compatible with tools like Verovio.

Conclusion: MUSE-Explainer provides clear, human-friendly explanations tailored to the structure of musical data, improving interpretability without producing unrealistic outputs.

Abstract: Interpretability is essential for deploying deep learning models in symbolic
music analysis, yet most research emphasizes model performance over
explanation. To address this, we introduce MUSE-Explainer, a new method that
helps reveal how music Graph Neural Network models make decisions by providing
clear, human-friendly explanations. Our approach generates counterfactual
explanations by making small, meaningful changes to musical score graphs that
alter a model's prediction while ensuring the results remain musically
coherent. Unlike existing methods, MUSE-Explainer tailors its explanations to
the structure of musical data and avoids unrealistic or confusing outputs. We
evaluate our method on a music analysis task and show it offers intuitive
insights that can be visualized with standard music tools such as Verovio.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a solution for multi-singer separation in a cappella music using data augmentation and a modified separation model to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-singer separation in a cappella music is challenging due to varying numbers of active singers across mixtures and scarcity of training data.

Method: The authors use a power set-based data augmentation strategy to expand datasets and introduce SepACap, an adaptation of SepReformer with periodic activations and a composite loss function.

Result: Experiments on the JaCappella dataset show superior performance in both ensemble and subset singer separation compared to spectrogram-based baselines.

Conclusion: SepACap, combined with data augmentation, achieves effective separation of singers, generalizes well, and sets a new benchmark for multi-singer separation.

Abstract: In this work, we study the task of multi-singer separation in a cappella
music, where the number of active singers varies across mixtures. To address
this, we use a power set-based data augmentation strategy that expands limited
multi-singer datasets into exponentially more training samples. To separate
singers, we introduce SepACap, an adaptation of SepReformer, a state-of-the-art
speaker separation model architecture. We adapt the model with periodic
activations and a composite loss function that remains effective when stems are
silent, enabling robust detection and separation. Experiments on the JaCappella
dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
both full-ensemble and subset singer separation scenarios, outperforming
spectrogram-based baselines while generalizing to realistic mixtures with
varying numbers of singers.

TL;DR: This paper introduces staged event trees as a novel framework for estimating treatment effects, offering enhanced interpretability and visual explanations of causal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the estimation of treatment effects, particularly using observational data, by leveraging a method that combines interpretability and adherence to causal assumptions.

Method: The authors employ staged event trees to reformulate classical causal inference estimators, validating their approach through simulation studies and real-world examples.

Result: The staged event trees framework is shown to enhance the estimation of treatment effects and visually identify when standard causal assumptions, such as positivity, are met.

Conclusion: Staged event trees provide an interpretable and practical tool for treatment effect estimation, making them highly applicable in clinical and policy-related contexts.

Abstract: Average and conditional treatment effects are fundamental causal quantities
used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in various critical
applications, including clinical settings and policy-making. Beyond the
gold-standard estimators from randomized trials, numerous methods have been
proposed to estimate treatment effects using observational data. In this paper,
we provide a novel characterization of widely used causal inference techniques
within the framework of staged event trees, demonstrating their capacity to
enhance treatment effect estimation. These models offer a distinct advantage
due to their interpretability, making them particularly valuable for practical
applications. We implement classical estimators within the framework of staged
event trees and illustrate their capabilities through both simulation studies
and real-world applications. Furthermore, we showcase how staged event trees
explicitly and visually describe when standard causal assumptions, such as
positivity, hold, further enhancing their practical utility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerovSegNet, a deep learning-based tool for automating the segmentation of SEM images to identify lead iodide, perovskite, and defect domains in thin-film characterization more efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SEM image analysis in perovskite solar cell fabrication relies heavily on manual efforts, which hampers throughput and consistency. Automating this process is critical for improving crystallization pathways, defect identification, and ensuring device stability.

Method: This study develops PerovSegNet, a model based on YOLOv8x architecture, integrating novel modules like Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block and Separable Adaptive Downsampling to enhance feature extraction and boundary recognition.

Result: PerovSegNet was trained on 10,994 SEM images, achieving a mean Average Precision of 87.25%, with significant reductions in model size (24.43%) and computational load (25.22%) compared to YOLOv8x-seg.

Conclusion: PerovSegNet is a scalable and efficient tool for real-time SEM image segmentation, offering quantitative metrics that aid in the optimization and monitoring of perovskite thin-film fabrication processes.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the
microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate
identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are
critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization
pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains
governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis
is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present
an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that
enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and
defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x
architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)
Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and
fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;
and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves
fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary
recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet
achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point
Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing
model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond
segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as
lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators
of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities
establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and
data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is

### [690] [Mechanisms of Matter: Language Inferential Benchmark on Physicochemical Hypothesis in Materials Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25281)
*Yingming Pu,Tao Lin,Hongyu Chen*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces MatterMech, a benchmark for assessing how well large language models (LLMs) generate scientific hypotheses for materials synthesis. The study finds that LLMs struggle with grounding reasoning in physicochemical principles, but a proposed prompting method improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to evaluate and improve the ability of LLMs to generate scientifically valid hypotheses in the materials science domain, particularly since their reasoning capabilities in terms of physicochemical principles have not been quantified.

Method: The authors create a benchmark called MatterMech, which evaluates hypothesis generation across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. They propose a principle-aware prompting methodology to improve the performance of LLMs.

Result: LLMs currently exhibit strong abstract logic but lack grounding in physicochemical principles. The principle-aware prompting method significantly enhances hypothesis accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework to advance the scientific use of LLMs by demonstrating a benchmark and an improved method for reliable hypothesis generation. MatterMech and the code are made publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate valid scientific
hypotheses for materials synthesis remains largely unquantified, hindered by
the absence of benchmarks probing physicochemical logics reasoning. To address
this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated
hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground
their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that
our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms
standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational
efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs
toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science. The
MatterMech benchmark and associated code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for calculating entanglement properties in asymptotically AdS metrics are often limited by the complexity of subregion shapes and computational challenges.

Method: The authors utilize PINNs, which integrate neural networks with physical principles, to solve equations governing holographic entanglement properties effectively across diverse geometries.

Result: PINNs successfully compute entanglement measures for arbitrary subregion shapes and validate the results against known benchmarks. Additionally, PINNs are shown to handle situations that are computationally impractical using conventional methods.

not straightforward to perform such computations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in AI research by creating a benchmark that tests AI models' economically relevant capabilities in performing knowledge work beyond coding.

Method: The benchmark, APEX-v1.0, was developed in three steps: sourcing top-tier experts, creating high-value tasks and prompts, and designing evaluation rubrics. It evaluates AI models using a language model judge on 200 test cases across four domains.

Result: Out of 23 evaluated models, GPT 5 achieved the highest score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 and Gemini 2.5 Flash. The best open-source model, Qwen 3 235B, was ranked seventh. A significant gap was identified between model performance and human experts.

Conclusion: APEX reveals the limitations of current frontier AI models in executing economically valuable tasks and underscores the importance of improved benchmarks to measure such abilities effectively.

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best

*Wontaek Kim,Tianyu Li,Sehoon Ha*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoReFlow, an unsupervised framework for motion retargeting across diverse characters using motion embedding spaces without relying on paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing motion retargeting techniques, such as dependency on paired datasets and handcrafted constraints, which restrict their application to humanoid characters and limited tasks.

Method: MoReFlow leverages a two-stage process: first, it uses VQ-VAE to create tokenized motion embeddings for characters, and second, it applies flow matching with conditional coupling to align latent spaces across characters for flexible retargeting.

Result: MoReFlow demonstrates superior performance in producing high-quality, controllable, and realistic motion across various characters and tasks without requiring paired motion datasets.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust and generalized solution for motion retargeting applicable to both animation and robotics, addressing style preservation and task alignment needs.

Abstract: Motion retargeting holds a premise of offering a larger set of motion data
for characters and robots with different morphologies. Many prior works have
approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion
datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow
behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of
retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in
animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose
MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that
learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method
consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each
character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we
employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces
across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned
matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow
enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data.
Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across
diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability,
generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines.

*Xinding Zhu,Xinye Yang,Shuyang Zheng,Zhexin Zhang,Fei Gao,Jing Huang,Jiazhou Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for automatic vector sketch animation, introducing a differentiable motion trajectory representation to improve temporal coherence and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenging issue of generating temporally coherent vector sketch animations, overcoming the problem of flickering in frame-wise animations.

Method: The paper introduces the Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT), which uses polynomial-based trajectories and Bernstein basis for frame-wise stroke control points, focusing on temporal coherence and stability. Sparse track points are used for explicit spatial modeling.

Result: DMT significantly improves semantic consistency, temporal coherence, and processing efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS and LVOS datasets. It also demonstrates robust applications across different domains.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust and efficient solution for vector sketch animation, compatible with various data domains and capable of generating high-quality, temporally coherent animations.

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D scene editing in terms of accuracy, visual fidelity, and ease of user customization, addressing challenges like complex edits and preserving scene coherence.

Method: The paper employs a three-stage process leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting: initializing Gaussians, using Adaptive Global-Local Optimization with regularization, and applying image-to-image synthesis for texture enhancement.

Result: Experiments show that GaussEdit outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy, visual quality, and processing speed.

Conclusion: GaussEdit offers a powerful, user-friendly tool for embedding concepts into 3D scenes with significant benefits over traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the
given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses
existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By
successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DiFACE, an approach for generating editable, diverse, and realistic 3D facial animations from audio input using a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of creating editable and highly realistic 3D facial animations from speech, which typically requires specialized expertise and lacks flexibility in current methods.

Method: The paper presents a fully-convolutional diffusion model that exploits viseme-level diversity, along with speaking-style personalization and sparsely-guided motion diffusion, for generating and editing 3D facial animations.

Result: Experiments confirm that 3DiFACE can generate diverse and realistic 3D animations, allowing precise control and editability, even from a single audio input.

Conclusion: 3DiFACE advances the state of 3D facial animation by enabling holistic, editable animations and balancing fidelity with diversity, offering innovative control and generation features.

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

TL;DR: The paper explores how technology integrates with Estonian manuscripts for interactive cultural heritage presentations using AI models, offering insights into machine interpretation of heritage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to connect historical Estonian narratives with modern technology and investigate how AI interprets cultural heritage, especially given the fragility of representation in digital environments.

Method: AI models Runway Gen-3 and Gen-4 are employed to visually interpret Estonian archive materials, creating dynamic and interactive artworks for visitors.

Result: The AI models generate new interpretations of Estonian heritage, introducing questions about machine creativity, memory, and fluidity in representing historical narratives.

Conclusion: The work highlights the dynamic yet fragile relationship between cultural heritage and digital environments, emphasizing challenges in representation, creativity, and interpretive errors in AI-driven heritage presentations.

Abstract: "Quantum est in libris" explores the intersection of the archaic and the
modern. On one side, there are manuscript materials from the Estonian National
Museum's (ERM) more than century-old archive describing the life experiences of
Estonian people; on the other side, there is technology that transforms these
materials into a dynamic and interactive experience. Connecting technology and
cultural heritage is the visitor, who turns texts into inputs for a screen
sculpture.
  Historical narratives are visually brought to life through the contemporary
technological language. Because the video AI models we employed, Runway Gen-3
and Gen-4, have not previously interacted with Estonian heritage, we can
observe how machines today "read the world" and create future heritage.
"Quantum est in libris" introduces an exciting yet unsettling new dimension to
the concept of cultural heritage: in a world where data are fluid and
interpretations unstable, heritage status becomes fragile. In the digital
environment, heritage issues are no longer just about preservation and
transmission, but also about representation of the media, machine creativity,
and interpretive error. Who or what shapes memory processes and memory spaces,
and how?

### [698] [Challenges and Solutions in Selecting Optimal Lossless Data Compression Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25219)
*Md. Atiqur Rahman,MM Fazle Rabbi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mathematical framework to unify and fairly compare compression ratio, encoding time, and decoding time for selecting optimal lossless data compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient lossless compression has grown with digital data expansion, but current algorithms struggle to balance high compression ratios and speed, making their selection challenging.

Method: The authors developed a framework that normalizes and weights compression ratio, encoding time, and decoding time into a single performance score for objective comparisons.

Result: Experiments on image and text datasets validate the framework's ability to recommend suitable compressors based on varying priorities in compression and speed.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical and fair tool for selecting compression algorithms, catering to diverse application needs while bridging theoretical metrics with real-world requirements.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Capacity-Net, an unsupervised learning model that optimizes phase shifts in RIS-aided mmWave MIMO systems to maximize achievable rates without relying on complete channel state information (CSI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key motivation is to address the challenge of optimizing RIS-aided mmWave systems, where severe channel fading and the need for accurate CSI hinder performance optimization.

Method: An unsupervised learning approach leveraging implicit CSI from received pilot signals is used to optimize the RIS phase-shifting factors, bypassing traditional channel estimation requirements.

Result: Simulation results validate the effectiveness of Capacity-Net, showing it outperforms traditional channel estimation-based learning methods in terms of achievable rates.

Conclusion: Capacity-Net presents an efficient and CSI-independent solution for optimizing RIS-aided systems, demonstrating superior performance than existing methods that rely on accurate channel estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning
approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we
optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to
enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily
on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often
challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.
To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with
implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually
requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of
the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of
channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among
the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant
achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning
methods based on traditional channel estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to optimize transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix in multiuser downlink systems, aiming to enhance spectrum efficiency while accounting for practical RIS coupling effects.

Method: The authors developed a DDPG-based DRL framework to solve the non-convex optimization problem arising from coupling effects between reflecting amplitude and phase shift in RIS elements.

Result: Simulation results revealed that the proposed DDPG approach outperforms current optimization-based algorithms and double deep Q-learning methods, especially in scenarios with random user distributions.

Conclusion: The DDPG-based framework effectively addresses RIS optimization in practical mmWave channel settings, showcasing its superiority in handling non-convex problems and random user environments.

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the
transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum
efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical
coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for
the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address
this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated
under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel
settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the
proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms
and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user
distributions.

*Mattia D'Emidio,Gabriele Di Stefano*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Study of computing top-$k$ simple shortest paths in weighted digraphs, introducing a novel polynomial-time algorithm outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Top-$k$ simple shortest paths have broad applications, but efficient solutions for the single-source case are underexplored.

Method: Developed a polynomial-time algorithm leveraging structural insights into the problem; compared it experimentally to existing approaches.

Result: The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline in runtime, achieving speed-ups of several orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Their algorithm is recommended for practical scenarios in computing top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a single source.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of computing the top-$k$ simple shortest paths in
weighted digraphs. While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple
shortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied
over the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements
emerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention
has been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is
determining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other
vertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest
paths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to
this problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of
the structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first
polynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it. On the one hand,
we prove our new algorithm is on par, in terms of time complexity, with the
best (and only) polynomial-time approach known in the literature to solve the
problem, that is applying the fastest single-pair algorithm independently to
each vertex pair formed by the source and the remaining vertices. On the other
hand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and
synthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and
significantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time,
achieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude. These results
establish our new algorithm as the solution to be preferred for computing $k$
simple shortest paths from a single source in practical settings.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm called UQ-Advice that uses uncertainty quantification (UQ) in forecasts to improve real-time decision-making for workload shifting in energy systems, showing theoretical and experimental advantages over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of making online real-time energy consumption decisions without future knowledge, leveraging advancements in uncertainty-aware forecasting.

Method: The authors propose UQ-Advice, an algorithm that incorporates UQ forecasts using a decision uncertainty score and introduce the metric of UQ-robustness to evaluate performance under forecast uncertainty.

Result: UQ-Advice demonstrated superior performance in trace-driven experiments using carbon intensity and electricity price data, outperforming methods that ignore forecast uncertainty.

Conclusion: UQ-Advice enhances decision-making in online workload shifting by effectively utilizing forecast uncertainties, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical success.

Abstract: A wide range of sustainability and grid-integration strategies depend on
workload shifting, which aligns the timing of energy consumption with external
signals such as grid curtailment events, carbon intensity, or time-of-use
electricity prices. The main challenge lies in the online nature of the
problem: operators must make real-time decisions (e.g., whether to consume
energy now) without knowledge of the future. While forecasts of signal values
are typically available, prior work on learning-augmented online algorithms has
relied almost exclusively on simple point forecasts. In parallel, the
forecasting research has made significant progress in uncertainty
quantification (UQ), which provides richer and more fine-grained predictive
information. In this paper, we study how online workload shifting can leverage
UQ predictors to improve decision-making. We introduce $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$, a
learning-augmented algorithm that systematically integrates UQ forecasts
through a $\textit{decision uncertainty score}$ that measures how forecast
uncertainty affects optimal future decisions. By introducing
$\textit{UQ-robustness}$, a new metric that characterizes how performance
degrades with forecast uncertainty, we establish theoretical performance
guarantees for $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$. Finally, using trace-driven experiments on
carbon intensity and electricity price data, we demonstrate that
$\texttt{UQ-Advice}$ consistently outperforms robust baselines and existing
learning-augmented methods that ignore uncertainty.

*Velimir Todorovski,Kwang Hak Kim,Miroslav Krstic*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a modular framework for smooth feedback stabilization of the unicycle in polar coordinates using strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to resolve longstanding challenges in unicycle stabilization by leveraging polar coordinates to achieve global asymptotic stabilization, bypassing limitations in Cartesian coordinates due to Brockett's condition.

Method: A modular framework is introduced, combining smooth feedback laws and strictly constructed control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for stabilization, with barrier variants for handling special cases.

Result: The approach ensures global asymptotic stabilization with explicit convergence rates and guarantees, excluding negligible subsets of rotation manifolds.

Conclusion: This framework advances stabilization methods by introducing bidirectional feedback laws and strict CLFs, serving as a foundation for further redesigns with meaningful cost functions in broader scenarios.

Abstract: Since the mid-1990s, it has been known that, unlike in Cartesian form where
Brockett's condition rules out static feedback stabilization, the unicycle is
globally asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback in polar coordinates.
In this note, we introduce a modular framework for designing smooth feedback
laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization in polar coordinates. These
laws are bidirectional, enabling efficient parking maneuvers, and are paired
with families of strict control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) constructed in a
modular fashion. The resulting CLFs guarantee global asymptotic stability with
explicit convergence rates and include barrier variants that yield "almost
global" stabilization, excluding only zero-measure subsets of the rotation

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper explores a modular framework for unicycle stabilization and reveals connections between two techniques, backstepping and integrator forwarding, in control design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the control design approaches (via CLFs) for unicycle and Dubins car parking problems using smooth steering laws.

Method: The authors utilize backstepping and integrator forwarding to construct smooth steering laws and control Lyapunov functions within polar coordinates.

Result: Both techniques produce equivalent solutions for the constant forward velocity (Dubins car), including finite-time parking strategies.

Conclusion: There exists a fundamental link between backstepping and forwarding, broadening their application in control systems for unicycle stabilization and vehicle parking problems.

Abstract: In a companion paper, we present a modular framework for unicycle
stabilization in polar coordinates that provides smooth steering laws through
backstepping. Surprisingly, the same problem also allows the application of
integrator forwarding. In this work, we leverage this feature and construct new
smooth steering laws together with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), expanding
the set of CLFs available for inverse optimal control design. In the case of
constant forward velocity (Dubins car), backstepping produces finite-time
(deadbeat) parking, and we show that integrator forwarding yields the very same
class of solutions. This reveals a fundamental connection between backstepping
and forwarding in addressing both the unicycle and, the Dubins car parking
problems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper focuses on improving safety and efficiency in highway ramp merging through a preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory adjustment system, achieving better traffic flow and reducing delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of driver perception delays and inefficient use of spatiotemporal resources in highway ramp merging, aiming to coordinate these resources effectively.

Method: The study introduces a merging control strategy that considers vehicle type, driving intentions, and safe distances, supported by simulations under various traffic and speed scenarios.

Result: Simulation results show significant improvements, with delay reductions of 90.24% for mainline vehicles and 74.24% for ramp vehicles, as well as enhanced safety and traffic stability.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively improves ramp merging safety and efficiency, showcasing notable advancements in driving stability and overall traffic optimization.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of driver's perception lag and low utilization
efficiency of space-time resources in expressway ramp confluence area, based on
the preemptive spatiotemporal trajectory Adjustment system, from the
perspective of coordinating spatiotemporal resources, the reasonable value of
safe space-time distance in trajectory pre-preparation is quantitatively
analyzed. The minimum safety gap required for ramp vehicles to merge into the
mainline is analyzed by introducing double positioning error and spatiotemporal
trajectory tracking error. A merging control strategy for autonomous driving
heterogeneous vehicles is proposed, which integrates vehicle type, driving
intention, and safety spatiotemporal distance. The specific confluence
strategies of ramp target vehicles and mainline cooperative vehicles under
different vehicle types are systematically expounded. A variety of traffic flow
and speed scenarios are used for full combination simulation. By comparing the
time-position-speed diagram, the vehicle operation characteristics and the
dynamic difference of confluence are qualitatively analyzed, and the average
speed and average delay are used as the evaluation indices to quantitatively
evaluate the performance advantages of the preemptive cooperative confluence
control strategy. The results show that the maximum average delay improvement
rates of mainline and ramp vehicles are 90.24 % and 74.24 %, respectively. The
proposed strategy can effectively avoid potential vehicle conflicts and
emergency braking behaviors, improve driving safety in the confluence area, and
show significant advantages in driving stability and overall traffic efficiency
optimization.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces stability guarantees for delay-adaptive control in nonlinear systems, showing the effectiveness of approximate predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of implementing delay-adaptive control systems when exact predictors are unavailable in practical scenarios.

Method: Two scenarios are analyzed: directly measurable input with semi-global stability guarantees and unmeasured inputs with local stability guarantees. Neural operators are proposed to achieve minimal approximation errors and numerical experiments are conducted.

Result: Stability guarantees are achieved, neural operators generalize well, and computational efficiency improves up to 15x in experiments.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework provides stability with approximate predictors, validated by experiments, bridging theory and practical applications.

Abstract: This work establishes the first rigorous stability guarantees for approximate
predictors in delay-adaptive control of nonlinear systems, addressing a key
challenge in practical implementations where exact predictors are unavailable.
We analyze two scenarios: (i) when the actuated input is directly measurable,
and (ii) when it is estimated online. For the measurable input case, we prove
semi-global practical asymptotic stability with an explicit bound proportional
to the approximation error $\epsilon$. For the unmeasured input case, we
demonstrate local practical asymptotic stability, with the region of attraction
explicitly dependent on both the initial delay estimate and the predictor
approximation error. To bridge theory and practice, we show that neural
operators-a flexible class of neural network-based approximators-can achieve
arbitrarily small approximation errors, thus satisfying the conditions of our
stability theorems. Numerical experiments on two nonlinear benchmark systems-a
biological protein activator/repressor model and a micro-organism growth
Chemostat model-validate our theoretical results. In particular, our numerical
simulations confirm stability under approximate predictors, highlight the
strong generalization capabilities of neural operators, and demonstrate a
substantial computational speedup of up to 15x compared to a baseline
fixed-point method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the inefficiency and scalability challenges in quantum circuit compilation for entanglement module linked trapped-ion architectures (EML-QCCD). High fidelity and scalability are essential for practical quantum applications, but ion shuttling remains a bottleneck.

Result: The proposed MUSS-TI reduces shuttle operations by 41.74% for quantum applications with 30-32 qubits, and achieves average reductions of 73.38% and 59.82% for larger applications involving 117-128 qubits and 256-299 qubits, respectively.

Conclusion: The study concludes that EML-QCCD architectures, combined with MUSS-TI, show promise in executing large-scale quantum applications efficiently, highlighting their potential in advancing practical quantum systems.

Abstract: Trapped-ion computing is a leading architecture in the pursuit of scalable

photonic interconnects offer a promising path for scaling trapped ion devices.
In this design, multiple Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) units are
interconnected through entanglement module. Each unit features a multi-zone

efficient and flexible quantum operations. However, achieving efficient and
scalable compilation of quantum circuits in such entanglement module linked
Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (EML-QCCD) remains a primary challenge for
practical quantum applications.
  In this work, we propose a scalable compiler tailored for large-scale
trapped-ion architectures, with the goal of reducing the shuttling overhead
inherent in EML-QCCD devices. MUSS-TI introduces a multi-level scheduling
approach inspired by multi-level memory scheduling in classical computing. This
method is designed to be aware of the distinct roles of different zones and to
minimize the number of shuttling operations required in EML-QCCD systems. We
demonstrate that EML-QCCD architectures are well-suited for executing
large-scale applications. Our evaluation shows that MUSS-TI reduces shuttle
operations by 41.74% for applications with 30-32 qubits, and by an average of
73.38% and 59.82% for applications with 117-128 qubits and 256-299 qubits,

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a specialized architecture for data with affine Boolean structures that avoids expensive non-Clifford gates and achieves optimal performance in early fault-tolerant quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the reliance on costly non-Clifford gates in existing QRAM architectures, which impedes practical implementation of data-intensive quantum algorithms.

Method: The Stab-QRAM leverages affinity in Boolean structures to optimize gate interactions using bipartite graph properties and König's edge-coloring theorem, relying solely on Clifford gates.

Result: Achieves an optimal $O(\log N)$ circuit depth and space complexity for $N$ data items, while eliminating the need for costly non-Clifford operations.

Conclusion: Stab-QRAM is a resource-efficient solution that advances the practical usability of fault-tolerant quantum systems, especially for scalable applications in optimization, time-series, and linear systems algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum
algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are
hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates
(e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement
fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM
(Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine
Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over
$\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series
analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate
interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By
applying K\"{o}nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that
Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data
items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is
constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero
$T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck,
eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it
exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We
highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications
in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear
Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive
tasks on emerging quantum hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential complexity of solving large TSP instances limits practical applications in logistics and network design.

Method: The approach combines the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for quantum optimization, classical K-means clustering for problem decomposition, and a RandomForestRegressor for refining solutions.

Result: Their method achieved an approximation ratio of 1.0287 for 80 cities, significantly improving on quantum-only approaches which yielded 1.9614.

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks show promising scalability for solving complex optimization problems like TSP, paving the way for quantum advantages with future hardware improvements.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a quintessential NP-hard
combinatorial optimisation challenge, is vital for logistics and network design
but limited by exponential complexity in large instances. We propose a hybrid
quantum-classical framework integrating variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
optimisation with classical machine learning, using K-means clustering for
problem decomposition and a RandomForestRegressor for path refinement.
Evaluated on 80 European cities (from 4 to 80 cities, 38,500 samples in total)
via Qiskit's AerSimulator and ibm_kyiv 127-qubit backend, the hybrid approach
outperforms quantum-only methods, achieving an approximation ratio of 1.0287 at
80 cities, a 47.5% improvement over quantum-only's 1.9614, nearing the
classical baseline. Machine learning reduces variability in tour distances
(interquartile range, IQR - the spread of the middle 50% of results relative to
the median - from 0.06 to 0.04), enhancing stability despite noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) noise. This framework underscores hybrid
strategies' potential for scalable TSP optimisation, with future hardware

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a derivative-free approach for trajectory optimization using sequential convex programming, making it suitable for cases where differentiation is challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiation is often computationally expensive or unavailable in trajectory optimization problems, posing challenges for traditional methods reliant on derivatives.

Method: The authors replace derivative computations with sample-based techniques to form convex approximations, enabling interpolation by the solver.

Result: The framework generalizes sample-based trajectory optimization methods, incorporating features like multiple shooting and general constraints.

Conclusion: The introduced framework is simple, flexible, and effective, broadening the applicability of trajectory optimization to diverse motion planning and control problems.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for solving trajectory optimization problems
in a derivative-free manner through the use of sequential convex programming.
Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and
solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and
constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions.
This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or
unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these
convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and
constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our
framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like
model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes
them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and
inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based
sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple,
flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning
and control problems.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FMIP, a generative framework that models joint distributions of integer and continuous variables in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming to improve solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computationally challenging nature of solving MILPs motivates the need for heuristic solutions that address the coupling between integer and continuous variables, currently overlooked by existing generative models.

Method: Proposes Joint Continuous-Integer Flow for MILP (FMIP), which jointly models distribution of both variable types, guided by a holistic refinement mechanism during inference.

Result: FMIP outperformed existing baseline methods, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average across eight benchmarks.

Conclusion: FMIP's ability to model joint distributions and refine solutions enhances both feasibility and optimality, while also being compatible with diverse MILP applications and solvers.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a foundational tool for complex
decision-making problems. However, the NP-hard nature of MILP presents a
significant computational challenge, motivating the development of machine
learning-based heuristic solutions to accelerate downstream solvers. While
recent generative models have shown promise in learning powerful heuristics,
they suffer from a critical limitation. That is, they model the distribution of
only the integer variables and fail to capture the intricate coupling between
integer and continuous variables, creating an information bottleneck and
ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose Joint
Continuous-Integer Flow for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMIP), which is
the first generative framework that models the joint distribution of both
integer and continuous variables for MILP solutions. Built upon the joint
modeling paradigm, a holistic guidance mechanism is designed to steer the
generative trajectory, actively refining solutions toward optimality and
feasibility during the inference process. Extensive experiments on eight
standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of FMIP against
existing baselines, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average. Moreover, we
show that FMIP is fully compatible with arbitrary backbone networks and various
downstream solvers, making it well-suited for a broad range of real-world MILP
applications.

TL;DR: The paper extends the concept of containers to indexed containers for dependently typed programming, exploring their monoidal structure and its connection to monads. It also presents examples formalized with Cubical Agda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a mathematical and functional framework that connects indexed containers to monads in dependently typed programming, aiding in better compositional reasoning and practical applications.

Method: The authors study the monoidal structure of indexed containers and provide a combinatorial characterization of monoids within this structure. They then relate these monoids to monads on the induced endofunctors. Technical results are formalized using Cubical Agda.

Result: The paper establishes a precise relationship between monoids in the category of indexed containers and monads on Set^I. Examples such as indexed state and writer monads and free monads are provided to illustrate the characterization.

Conclusion: The work offers a novel characterization of monads via monoids in the monoidal category of indexed containers, enriching the theoretical understanding and practical toolset for dependently typed programming contexts.

Abstract: Containers represent a wide class of type constructions relevant for
functional programming and (co)inductive reasoning. Indexed containers
generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed
programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an
endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an
endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets.
  We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers
whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective
induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids
in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely
to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by
presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our
characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the
state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad. The technical
results of this work are accompanied by a formalization in the proof assistant
Cubical Agda.

TL;DR: The paper fine-tunes DNABERT-2, a genomic language model, to identify gene enhancers in colorectal cancer using DNA sequences alone, achieving notable results compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancers regulate gene expression but are hard to identify due to their sequence diversity and tissue specificity, especially in colorectal cancer.

Method: The study fine-tuned DNABERT-2 with a 2.34 million enhancer sequence dataset, employing summit-centered extraction, data de-duplication, and hyperparameter optimization to train and evaluate the model's classification performance.

Result: DNABERT-2 achieved PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and a best F1 of 0.704, with better ranking and recall than EnhancerNet but slightly lower point accuracy.

Conclusion: The results highlight the potential of transformer-based genomic models for classifying regulatory elements, moving beyond motif-based methods, with future work aimed at improving precision and validating across datasets.

Abstract: Gene enhancers control when and where genes switch on, yet their sequence
diversity and tissue specificity make them hard to pinpoint in colorectal
cancer. We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer
genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length
tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre
at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1
kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous
de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data
stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen
empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned
hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached
PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold
(0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet
trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent
ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model
with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer,
demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals
directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that
transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward
holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for
cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid
CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to
strengthen real-world utility.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables systematic
delineation of cellular states and interactions, providing crucial insights
into cellular heterogeneity. Building on this potential, numerous computational
methods have been developed for tasks such as cell clustering, cell type

Motivation: Existing DFT initial guess methods rely on predicting Hamiltonian matrices, which are difficult to predict and lack transferability. There is a need for a universally transferable DFT acceleration method.

Method: The authors use E(3)-equivariant neural networks to predict electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation, trained on small molecules and tested on larger systems.

Result: The method reduced SCF steps by an average of 33.3%, outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric models. It showed consistent acceleration across different system sizes, orbital basis sets, and XC functionals.

Conclusion: This method is a promising, universally transferable candidate for DFT acceleration. The release of the SCFbench dataset supports further research in this area.

Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed
for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses
are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density
matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing
works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining
high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both
numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering
the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose
a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density
in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural
networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to
achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems
up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric
models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing
system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis
sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,
this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally
transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench
dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this
promising direction.

### [719] [Are neural scaling laws leading quantum chemistry astray?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26397)
*Siwoo Lee,Adji Bousso Dieng*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of neural scaling laws in predicting bond dissociation energy for simple molecules like H$_2$. Results show significant failures in predictions, challenging the utility of scaling alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore if scaling model capacity and training data, as per neural scaling laws, can lead to reliable machine learning models for quantum chemistry tasks, such as bond dissociation energy predictions.

Method: The researchers scaled model capacity and training data derived from quantum chemical calculations. They evaluated the models' ability to predict the bond dissociation energy of H$_2$ and tested generalizability across different molecular geometries.

Result: The study found that models trained solely on stable structures fail to reproduce energy curves qualitatively. Inclusion of stretched or compressed geometries improved performance marginally. However, even the largest models failed to reproduce basic physical laws like Coulomb's law.

Conclusion: Scaling alone is insufficient to create reliable quantum chemical models. Fundamental physical behaviors must be incorporated to ensure accurate predictions.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward
training ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy
and transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise
in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum
chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting
models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the
simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model
capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even
qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and
stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions
roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models
trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating
diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most
strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two
bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved
in electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is
insufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the interpretability challenges of machine learning in approximating physical concepts, particularly in understanding machine learning's capability to learn physics.

Method: A hybrid tensor-neural network is constructed to express real-space topological invariants, rigorously testing its trainability and generalization against other types of neural networks.

Result: The tensor-neural network's performance is benchmarked, showing distinctions in its trainability and representation power compared to other neural networks.

Conclusion: The work sheds light on the difficulties in learning topological invariants using machine learning while paving the way for more accurate and generalizable models in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Much attention has been devoted to the use of machine learning to approximate
physical concepts. Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine
learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are
able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and
its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application
of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a
hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space
topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and
generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a
tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying
the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights
the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping
stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning
representations in condensed matter physics.

Motivation: Simplify architectural complexity and improve robustness, security, and developer experience for modern applications.

Method: Designed a database architecture combining actor model, IVM, and zero-trust security; detailed core architecture and trade-offs.

Result: Set performance criteria for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to showcase the concept's feasibility.

Conclusion: ActorDB has the potential to streamline the development of secure, scalable, and data-intensive applications, eliminating manual system integration complexities.

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but
complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce
architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications.
We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

### [723] [From NL2SQL to NL2GeoSQL: GeoSQL-Eval for automated evaluation of LLMs on PostGIS queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25264)
*Shuyang Hou,Haoyue Jiao,Ziqi Liu,Lutong Xie,Guanyu Chen,Shaowen Wu,Xuefeng Guan,Huayi Wu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper presents GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end evaluation framework for GeoSQL tasks in PostGIS, and includes a benchmark dataset (GeoSQL-Bench) with 14178 questions. The study systematically evaluates 24 language models and introduces a public leaderboard for ongoing assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced NL2SQL, but challenges remain in applying these to GeoSQL tasks due to spatial complexity and lack of tailored benchmarks.

Method: The paper introduces GeoSQL-Eval based on the Depth of Knowledge model, which evaluates models across dimensions like syntax, semantics, execution, and robustness. They also created GeoSQL-Bench, a dataset with diverse task categories, databases, and PostGIS functions.

Result: The study systematically tested 24 models across six categories, examining performance using entropy-weighted statistical analyses. Differences in error distributions and resource consumption were identified.

Conclusion: GeoSQL-Eval provides a scalable and standardized framework for GeoSQL model evaluation, enabling advancements in spatial database applications and offering insights into optimization for fields like GIS and spatial analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation
(NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS
environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions,
geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily
focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation,
leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To
address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end
automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's
Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive
dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a
comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge
acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and
robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset
comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions,
and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically
evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying
entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in
performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns.
Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables
global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These
contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also
provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating
LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for
model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban
studies, and spatial analysis.

### [724] [EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper scoring rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26258)
*Maybritt Schillinger,Maxim Samarin,Xinwei Shen,Reto Knutti,Nicolai Meinshausen*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces EnScale, a machine learning (ML) framework for downscaling global circulation models (GCMs) into high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs). EnScale is computationally efficient, performs accurate multivariable emulation, and ensures spatial and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downscaling coarse climate projections from GCMs to RCMs is computationally expensive, and current ML methods lack efficiency while modeling the large variability of climate data accurately.

Method: The EnScale framework uses generative ML models optimized with the energy score to perform two steps: adjusting large-scale mismatches between GCM and RCM data and generating super-resolution high-resolution fields. A variant, EnScale-t, ensures temporal consistency.

Result: EnScale reduces computational cost by one order of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art methods and performs strong multivariable emulations for temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind, with demonstrated spatial and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: EnScale is an efficient and accurate generative ML framework for emulating RCM outputs at high resolution, offering advancements in computational speed, spatial structure, and multivariable dependency modeling.

Abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation
models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring
downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs)
provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this
issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping
coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative
approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given
coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus
challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine
learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on
multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale
mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution
step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models
optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to
state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational
cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple
variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially
consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant
EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a
comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including
calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies.
Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance
and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate
and temporally consistent RCM emulation.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of toxicity in online platforms and artificial intelligence systems, proposing a comprehensive taxonomy to detect and mitigate such behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Toxicity in online interactions, expressed via language, images, and videos, negatively impacts individuals and society on a global scale.

Method: The paper creates a taxonomy by summarizing toxicity-related datasets and methods for detection and mitigation in AI and online platforms, focusing on English textual data.

Result: The survey presents a detailed analysis of existing research on toxicity, datasets, and mitigation strategies, identifying research gaps.

Conclusion: A holistic understanding of toxicity and context will enable better proactive measures and solutions for detecting and mitigating toxicity.

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Sandbox Configurator, a modular framework, to address fragmented assessment methods, standardization issues, and weak feedback loops in AI regulatory sandboxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the systematic assessment of AI systems under the EU's AI Regulatory Sandboxes and address challenges like fragmented methods, lack of standardization, and poor developer-regulator feedback loops.

Method: Development of an open-source Sandbox Configurator framework with a modular, plug-in architecture that offers domain-specific tests, customizable dashboards, and promotes interoperability.

Result: The framework provides structured workflows for Competent Authorities, robust evaluation integration for technical experts, and transparent compliance pathways for AI providers.

Conclusion: The Sandbox Configurator fosters standardization, innovation, and cross-border collaboration, supporting a scalable infrastructure for trustworthy AI governance in the EU.

Abstract: The systematic assessment of AI systems is increasingly vital as these
technologies enter high-stakes domains. To address this, the EU's Artificial
Intelligence Act introduces AI Regulatory Sandboxes (AIRS): supervised
environments where AI systems can be tested under the oversight of Competent
Authorities (CAs), balancing innovation with compliance, particularly for
startups and SMEs. Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are
fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers
and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox
Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select
domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox
environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to
support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of
interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple
stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations;
technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers
access a transparent pathway to compliance. By promoting cross-border
collaboration and standardisation, the Sandbox Configurator's goal is to
support a scalable and innovation-friendly European infrastructure for
trustworthy AI governance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address common challenges in practical computer science education such as plagiarism, limited hands-on learning, and lack of effective assessment methods.

Method: The proposed method involves online lab allocation, dataset-driven dynamic question generation, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and gamification through simulators.

Result: Validation metrics show high accuracy and diversity in the dynamically generated questions, overcoming traditional limitations in lab assessments.

Conclusion: The framework integrates multiple innovations to enhance the quality of lab education, offering a scalable solution for producing highly skilled graduates.

Abstract: Practical lab education in computer science often faces challenges such as
plagiarism, lack of proper lab records, unstructured lab conduction, inadequate
execution and assessment, limited practical learning, low student engagement,
and absence of progress tracking for both students and faculties, resulting in
graduates with insufficient hands-on skills. In this paper, we introduce
AsseslyAI, which addresses these challenges through online lab allocation, a
unique lab problem for each student, AI-proctored viva evaluations, and
gamified simulators to enhance engagement and conceptual mastery. While
existing platforms generate questions based on topics, our framework fine-tunes
on a 10k+ question-answer dataset built from AI/ML lab questions to dynamically
generate diverse, code-rich assessments. Validation metrics show high
question-answer similarity, ensuring accurate answers and non-repetitive
questions. By unifying dataset-driven question generation, adaptive difficulty,
plagiarism resistance, and evaluation in a single pipeline, our framework
advances beyond traditional automated grading tools and offers a scalable path
to produce genuinely skilled graduates.

TL;DR: This paper explores the integration of AI in education, identifying its transformative potential across various domains like ethics, creativity, and engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address how AI reshapes traditional teaching and learning practices by leveraging its potential across cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions.

Method: The authors used conceptual insights from recent literature on AI, empirical insights from popular podcasts, public releases, and analyzed multiple domains such as emotional support and problem-solving.

Result: AI, when thoughtfully implemented, complements educators in fostering richer learning experiences, enhancing collaboration, ethical reasoning, creativity, and social engagement.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a call for an optimistic and responsible AI-integration approach, urging stakeholders to prioritize human-centric values and actively shape AI's educational role.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping educational practice,
challenging long held assumptions about teaching and learning. This article
integrates conceptual perspectives from recent books (Genesis by Eric Schmidt,
Henry Kissinger and Craig Mundie, CoIntelligence by Ethan Mollick, and The
Inevitable by Kevin Kelly) with empirical insights from popular AI podcasts and
Anthropic public releases. We examine seven key domains: emotional support,
creativity, contextual understanding, student engagement, problem solving,
ethics and morality, and collaboration. For each domain, we explore AI
capabilities, opportunities for transformative change, and emerging best
practices, drawing equally from theoretical analysis and real world
observations. Overall, we find that AI, when used thoughtfully, can complement
and enhance human educators in fostering richer learning experiences across
cognitive, social, and emotional dimensions. We emphasize an optimistic yet
responsible outlook: educators and students should actively shape AI
integration to amplify human potential in creativity, ethical reasoning,
collaboration, and beyond, while maintaining a focus on human centric values.

*Ke Luoma,Li Zengyi,Liao Jiangqun,Tong Song,Peng Kaiping*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study evaluates the capability of LLMs to simulate cultural psychological patterns based on demographics, finding similarities but also systematic differences compared to human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore whether LLMs can serve as effective proxies for human psychological patterns in diverse cultural and regional contexts, thereby evaluating their potential for large-scale psychological studies.

Method: The study used DeepSeek to generate virtual participants matched to real demographic data from the CFPS2018, comparing their Big Five personality traits and happiness ratings with actual human data from seven Chinese regions.

Result: The results showed general similarities in regional psychological trends, but also noted systematic differences in personality scores and happiness levels between the simulated and human datasets. Predictive structures for happiness also diverged between the two datasets.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in approximating psychological patterns, they fall short in capturing culturally specific and affective elements, indicating the need for more culturally enriched training data and better affective modeling.

Abstract: This study examines whether LLMs can simulate culturally grounded
psychological patterns based on demographic information. Using DeepSeek, we
generated 2943 virtual participants matched to demographic distributions from
the CFPS2018 and compared them with human responses on the Big Five personality
traits and subjective well-being across seven Chinese regions.Personality was
measured using a 15-item Chinese Big Five inventory, and happiness with a
single-item rating. Results revealed broad similarity between real and
simulated datasets, particularly in regional variation trends. However,
systematic differences emerged:simulated participants scored lower in
extraversion and openness, higher in agreeableness and neuroticism, and
consistently reported lower happiness. Predictive structures also diverged:
while human data identified conscientiousness, extraversion and openness as
positive predictors of happiness, the AI emphasized openness and agreeableness,
with extraversion predicting negatively. These discrepancies suggest that while
LLMs can approximate population-level psychological distributions, they
underrepresent culturally specific and affective dimensions. The findings
highlight both the potential and limitations of LLM-based virtual participants
for large-scale psychological research and underscore the need for culturally
enriched training data and improved affective modeling.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit democratic or autocratic inclinations, finding variability among models and ties to the political culture of their originating countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover whether generative AI systems like LLMs reflect and potentially propagate socio-political ideologies prevalent in the countries where they are developed.

Method: Experiments were conducted with leading LLMs from different political contexts, employing psychometric and political orientation measures, with both numerical and qualitative analyses of their outputs.

Result: High variability was observed between LLMs, with the political orientation of the models strongly influenced by the political culture of their country of origin.

Conclusion: AI systems like LLMs inherently carry socio-political dimensions, underscoring the necessity for detailed scrutiny of their embedded ideologies and biases.

Abstract: Political beliefs vary significantly across different countries, reflecting
distinct historical, cultural, and institutional contexts. These ideologies,
ranging from liberal democracies to rigid autocracies, influence human
societies, as well as the digital systems that are constructed within those
societies. The advent of generative artificial intelligence, particularly Large
Language Models (LLMs), introduces new agents in the political space-agents
trained on massive corpora that replicate and proliferate socio-political
assumptions. This paper analyses whether LLMs display propensities consistent
with democratic or autocratic world-views. We validate this insight through
experimental tests in which we experiment with the leading LLMs developed
across disparate political contexts, using several existing psychometric and
political orientation measures. The analysis is based on both numerical scoring
and qualitative analysis of the models' responses. Findings indicate high
model-to-model variability and a strong association with the political culture
of the country in which the model was developed. These findings highlight the
need for more detailed examination of the socio-political dimensions embedded
within AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper studies the Model Context Protocol (MCP), analyzing its ecosystem through a systematic framework called MCPCrawler to provide insights on growth, security, standardization, and risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the maturity, functionality, and potential risks of the MCP ecosystem amidst its rapid adoption and growing hype.

Method: The authors developed MCPCrawler, a measurement tool to collect data from six major MCP markets and analyze the collected 17,630 raw entries during a 14-day campaign.

Result: Out of 17,630 entries, 8,401 valid projects were analyzed, revealing over half of listed projects were low-value, servers had structural risks, and clients showed protocol fragmentation.

Conclusion: The MCP ecosystem is in a transitional phase, facing systemic risks and standardization challenges, offering insights for its improvement and future trajectory.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for
connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources,
promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web
and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains
uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by
placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and
privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients
converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing
designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the
MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement
framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a
14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid
projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that
more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face
structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and
that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns.
Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP
ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory.

Motivation: The study aims to explore how AI is being adopted in the under-researched context of developing countries, particularly in Pakistani K-12 schools.

Method: Survey of 125 educators focusing on their familiarity, frequency, modes of use, and attitudes toward AI adoption.

Result: The study found that over two-thirds of teachers are willing to adopt AI with support, and AI is mainly used for content creation. However, usage remains uneven, and there are concerns about equitable access.

Conclusion: There is enthusiasm for AI's potential in education, but training and infrastructure improvements are crucial for inclusive and effective implementation.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly permeating classrooms worldwide,
yet its adoption in schools of developing countries remains under-explored.
This paper investigates AI adoption, usage patterns, and perceived impact in
Pakistani K-12 schools based on a survey of 125 educators. The questionnaire
covered educator's familiarity with AI, frequency and modes of use, and
attitudes toward AI's benefits and challenges. Results reveal a generally
positive disposition towards AI: over two-thirds of teachers expressed
willingness to adopt AI tools given proper support and many have begun
integrating AI for lesson planning and content creation. However, AI usage is
uneven - while about one-third of respondents actively use AI tools frequently,
others remain occasional users. Content generation emerged as the most common
AI application, whereas AI-driven grading and feedback are rarely used.
Teachers reported moderate improvements in student engagement and efficiency
due to AI, but also voiced concerns about equitable access. These findings
highlight both the enthusiasm for AI's potential in Pakistan's schools and the
need for training and infrastructure to ensure inclusive and effective

### [733] [Economic Competition, EU Regulation, and Executive Orders: A Framework for Discussing AI Policy Implications in CS Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25524)
*James Weichert,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper highlights the importance of integrating discussions about AI policies into computer science (CS) education, given the rapid evolution of AI technologies and the diverse, sometimes conflicting, governance frameworks. It proposes a framework for introducing these discussions into CS courses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to prepare CS students for challenges arising from AI governance, as AI technologies continue to evolve and AI policies vary across entities, creating a complex regulatory environment.

Method: The authors summarize recent AI policy developments in the United States and European Union and propose guiding questions to facilitate classroom discussions. They emphasize the integration of normative policy demands with technical challenges in CS education.

Result: The paper provides a framework that bridges AI policy discussions and CS education, aiming to help CS students understand and adapt to regulatory complexities.

Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity of equipping future AI developers with the skills to navigate and adapt to an evolving AI policy landscape, thus advancing the integration of governance considerations into CS curricula.

Abstract: The growth and permeation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across
society has drawn focus to the ways in which the responsible use of these
technologies can be facilitated through AI governance. Increasingly, large
companies and governments alike have begun to articulate and, in some cases,
enforce governance preferences through AI policy. Yet existing literature
documents an unwieldy heterogeneity in ethical principles for AI governance,
while our own prior research finds that discussions of the implications of AI
policy are not yet present in the computer science (CS) curriculum. In this
context, overlapping jurisdictions and even contradictory policy preferences
across private companies, local, national, and multinational governments create
a complex landscape for AI policy which, we argue, will require AI developers
able adapt to an evolving regulatory environment. Preparing computing students
for the new challenges of an AI-dominated technology industry is therefore a
key priority for the CS curriculum.
  In this discussion paper, we seek to articulate a framework for integrating
discussions on the nascent AI policy landscape into computer science courses.
We begin by summarizing recent AI policy efforts in the United States and
European Union. Subsequently, we propose guiding questions to frame class
discussions around AI policy in technical and non-technical (e.g., ethics) CS
courses. Throughout, we emphasize the connection between normative policy
demands and still-open technical challenges relating to their implementation
and enforcement through code and governance structures. This paper therefore
represents a valuable contribution towards bridging research and discussions
across the areas of AI policy and CS education, underlining the need to prepare
AI engineers to interact with and adapt to societal policy preferences.

*Yong Oh Lee,Byeonghun Bang,Joohyun Lee,Sejun Oh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper presents a system using GPT-4 for personalized grading and feedback on geometry tasks, deployed on the Algeomath platform. It was piloted with 79 students and showed strong alignment with teacher evaluations, providing scalable formative assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing need for intelligent systems capable of assessing complex student responses and providing personalized feedback in real-time, particularly in mathematics education.

Method: It utilizes GPT-4 with prompt-based grading through few-shot learning, compares student answers to model solutions, and adapts feedback dynamically based on student problem-solving history in iterative attempts. Feedback is generated using teacher-authored examples.

Result: The system closely aligns with teacher assessments, aiding students in revising errors and completing multi-step tasks. Short-term corrections were effective, but longer-term effects were unclear.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the scalability of LLMs for teacher-aligned assessment in mathematics but identifies areas requiring improvement, such as terminology handling and feedback design.

Abstract: As personalized learning gains increasing attention in mathematics education,
there is a growing demand for intelligent systems that can assess complex
student responses and provide individualized feedback in real time. In this
study, we present a personalized auto-grading and feedback system for
constructive geometry tasks, developed using large language models (LLMs) and
deployed on the Algeomath platform, a Korean online tool designed for
interactive geometric constructions. The proposed system evaluates
student-submitted geometric constructions by analyzing their procedural
accuracy and conceptual understanding. It employs a prompt-based grading
mechanism using GPT-4, where student answers and model solutions are compared
through a few-shot learning approach. Feedback is generated based on
teacher-authored examples built from anticipated student responses, and it
dynamically adapts to the student's problem-solving history, allowing up to
four iterative attempts per question. The system was piloted with 79
middle-school students, where LLM-generated grades and feedback were
benchmarked against teacher judgments. Grading closely aligned with teachers,
and feedback helped many students revise errors and complete multi-step
geometry tasks. While short-term corrections were frequent, longer-term
transfer effects were less clear. Overall, the study highlights the potential
of LLMs to support scalable, teacher-aligned formative assessment in
mathematics, while pointing to improvements needed in terminology handling and
feedback design.

### [735] [Bubble, Bubble, AI's Rumble: Why Global Financial Regulatory Incident Reporting is Our Shield Against Systemic Stumbles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26150)
*Anchal Gupta,Gleb Pappyshev,James T Kwok*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a global database to track AI-driven systemic risks in financial markets, addressing the gap in current incident reporting frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the transparency crisis in capital markets triggered by opaque AI-driven trading systems, as current databases overlook algorithmic trading anomalies.

Method: The authors propose a regulatory-grade global incident database using post-trade reporting frameworks combined with healthcare and aviation documentation models. They utilize a temporal data masking technique and K-means clustering analysis for cross-jurisdictional insights while ensuring confidentiality.

Result: Their synthetic data validation reveals patterns of systemic risks crossing geographical boundaries, distinguishable clusters of market manipulation, and the significant influence of AI typology on trading behavior over location.

Conclusion: The proposed solution will provide regulators, institutions, and investors with tools to combat AI-driven vulnerabilities, enhance risk management, and foster global financial stability through improved transparency and oversight.

Abstract: "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble." As
Shakespeare's witches foretold chaos through cryptic prophecies, modern capital
markets grapple with systemic risks concealed by opaque AI systems. According
to IMF, the August 5, 2024, plunge in Japanese and U.S. equities can be linked
to algorithmic trading yet ab-sent from existing AI incidents database
exemplifies this transparency crisis. Current AI incident databases, reliant on
crowdsourcing or news scraping, systematically over-look capital market
anomalies, particularly in algorithmic and high-frequency trading. We address
this critical gap by proposing a regulatory-grade global database that
elegantly synthesises post-trade reporting frameworks with proven incident
documentation models from healthcare and aviation. Our framework's temporal
data omission technique masking timestamps while preserving percent-age-based
metrics enables sophisticated cross-jurisdictional analysis of emerging risks
while safeguarding confidential business information. Synthetic data validation
(modelled after real life published incidents , sentiments, data) reveals
compelling pat-terns: systemic risks transcending geographical boundaries,
market manipulation clusters distinctly identifiable via K-means algorithms,
and AI system typology exerting significantly greater influence on trading
behaviour than geographical location, This tripartite solution empowers
regulators with unprecedented cross-jurisdictional oversight, financial
institutions with seamless compliance integration, and investors with critical
visibility into previously obscured AI-driven vulnerabilities. We call for
immediate action to strengthen risk management and foster resilience in
AI-driven financial markets against the volatile "cauldron" of AI-driven
systemic risks., promoting global financial stability through enhanced
transparency and coordinated oversight.

### [736] [Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25486)
*Maximilian Schebek,Jutta Rogal*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced Boltzmann Generator architecture using graph neural networks and augmented coupling flows for scalable sampling of large materials systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling generative models, like Boltzmann Generators, to handle large many-body systems efficiently is a significant challenge, particularly in materials science.

Method: The authors propose combining augmented coupling flows with graph neural networks to leverage local environmental data. This approach enhances energy-based training, inference speed, and scalability.

Result: The proposed model trains faster, requires fewer computational resources, achieves better sampling efficiency, and is applicable to larger systems. It successfully generates accurate equilibrium ensembles for large-scale materials systems.

Conclusion: The architecture significantly improves sampling for large materials systems in terms of both accuracy and scalability, demonstrating its utility in computing ensemble and free energies for larger, more realistic simulations.

Abstract: The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body
systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted
substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated
samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the
natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major
challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that
addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials
science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural
networks to base the generation process on local environmental information,
while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to
previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far
less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies.
Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which
allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of
unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it
to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of
mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one
thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate
equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and
Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where
finite-size effects become negligible.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAU, a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese 'soundmarks,' to assess the capability of audio-language models in recognizing culturally distinctive non-semantic audio, revealing limitations of current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in audio-language model evaluation, which neglects culturally specific sounds that are crucial for local communities but not recognizable by outsiders.

Method: The researchers created TAU, a benchmark composed of Taiwanese soundmarks using a pipeline that integrates curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, encompassing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art large audio-language models fail to perform well on the TAU benchmark, with local humans significantly outperforming them.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity of localized benchmarks for assessing cultural blind spots in models and promoting equitable multimodal evaluation that serves diverse communities.

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations
emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive
cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to
localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but
outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),
a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline
combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,
producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by
transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including
Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates
the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more
equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the
global mainstream.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Game-Time Benchmark to assess temporal capabilities of Conversational Spoken Language Models, pointing out weaknesses in timing and conversational fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unevaluated challenge of managing timing, tempo, and simultaneous speaking in conversational spoken language models.

Method: The Game-Time Benchmark evaluates SLMs through tasks with temporal constraints like tempo adherence and synchronized responses alongside basic instruction-following tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform well on basic tasks but degrade significantly under temporal constraints, revealing weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction.

Conclusion: The Game-Time Benchmark highlights the necessity for focused research on temporal dynamics in conversational AI and serves as a foundation for advancements in the domain.

Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising
paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal
dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous
speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational
fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework
to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans
learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic
instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such
as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM
architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art
models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with
fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade
substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in
time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a
foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware
conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website

*Héctor Delgado,Giorgio Ramondetti,Emanuele Dalmasso,Gennady Karvitsky,Daniele Colibro,Haydar Talib*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Current deepfake detection systems fail to generalize effectively to real-world applications due to differences between raw and communication channel-modified deepfake audio. This paper proposes a novel framework for dataset creation and research methodology aimed at improving countermeasure robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in generative AI have resulted in sophisticated malicious audio deepfakes, whereas anti-deepfake research has lagged behind. Current methods fail in real-world applications due to data and research limitations.

Method: The paper suggests creating datasets with deepfake audio presented via communication channels (e.g., phone systems) and following improved research guidelines to develop robust countermeasures.

Result: Using their proposed framework, detection accuracy improved by 39% in lab setups and 57% in real-world benchmarks. Enhanced datasets proved more impactful than simply scaling model size.

Conclusion: Investing in better dataset collection programs is crucial for advancing deepfake detection, potentially outweighing the benefits of training larger AI models.

Abstract: While the technologies empowering malicious audio deepfakes have dramatically
evolved in recent years due to generative AI advances, the same cannot be said
of global research into spoofing (deepfake) countermeasures. This paper
highlights how current deepfake datasets and research methodologies led to
systems that failed to generalize to real world application. The main reason is
due to the difference between raw deepfake audio, and deepfake audio that has
been presented through a communication channel, e.g. by phone. We propose a new
framework for data creation and research methodology, allowing for the
development of spoofing countermeasures that would be more effective in
real-world scenarios. By following the guidelines outlined here we improved
deepfake detection accuracy by 39% in more robust and realistic lab setups, and
by 57% on a real-world benchmark. We also demonstrate how improvement in
datasets would have a bigger impact on deepfake detection accuracy than the
choice of larger SOTA models would over smaller models; that is, it would be
more important for the scientific community to make greater investment on
comprehensive data collection programs than to simply train larger models with
higher computational demands.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI and XR integration is hindered by complex systems; XR Blocks aims to simplify prototyping with modular components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies the gap between AI and XR ecosystems, where AI has mature tools but XR development is highly frictional.

Method: The authors introduced XR Blocks, a modular framework using accessible tools (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini) to streamline XR prototyping.

Result: They showcased XR Blocks' effectiveness through templates, samples, and demos, enabling rapid concept-to-prototype transitions.

Conclusion: XR Blocks significantly simplifies AI + XR innovation, lowering barriers for creators and accelerating development.

Abstract: We are on the cusp where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality
(XR) are converging to unlock new paradigms of interactive computing. However,
a significant gap exists between the ecosystems of these two fields: while AI
research and development is accelerated by mature frameworks like JAX and
benchmarks like LMArena, prototyping novel AI-driven XR interactions remains a
high-friction process, often requiring practitioners to manually integrate
disparate, low-level systems for perception, rendering, and interaction. To
bridge this gap, we present XR Blocks, a cross-platform framework designed to
accelerate human-centered AI + XR innovation. XR Blocks strives to provide a
modular architecture with plug-and-play components for core abstraction in AI +
XR: user, world, peers; interface, context, and agents. Crucially, it is
designed with the mission of "reducing frictions from idea to reality", thus
accelerating rapid prototyping of AI + XR apps. Built upon accessible
technologies (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini), our toolkit lowers the
barrier to entry for XR creators. We demonstrate its utility through a set of
open-source templates, samples, and advanced demos, empowering the community to
quickly move from concept to interactive XR prototype. Site:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for AI tools in music composition to support human creativity without undermining the musician’s artistic identity.

Method: The researchers conducted a four-week ecological evaluation of a music variation tool, analyzing its interaction with a musician’s skill in providing input and shaping ideas, complemented by qualitative interviews.

Result: The study found that musicians retained a strong sense of ownership over the creative process and the final work due to their active role in providing input and refining ideas.

Conclusion: The research highlights the importance of designing musical AI tools that enhance, rather than replace, human creativity by preserving the human element of artistic expression.

Abstract: This paper investigates the importance of personal ownership in musical AI
design, examining how practising musicians can maintain creative control over
the compositional process. Through a four-week ecological evaluation, we
examined how a music variation tool, reliant on the skill of musicians,
functioned within a composition setting. Our findings demonstrate that the
dependence of the tool on the musician's ability, to provide a strong initial
musical input and to turn moments into complete musical ideas, promoted
ownership of both the process and artefact. Qualitative interviews further
revealed the importance of this personal ownership, highlighting tensions
between technological capability and artistic identity. These findings provide
insight into how musical AI can support rather than replace human creativity,
highlighting the importance of designing tools that preserve the humanness of
musical expression.

TL;DR: This paper explores methods for implementing Transformer ML architecture for High-Energy Physics tasks on FPGA hardware, emphasizing inference applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient deployment of Transformer-based ML models for tasks like jet tagging and particle tracking on resource-constrained FPGA hardware.

Method: Development of methodologies and tools for monolithic or partitioned Transformer synthesis targeted at inference applications, focusing on two tracking model designs from the TrackFormers project.

Result: Preliminary results and comparisons related to the deployment of Transformer models on FPGAs are presented.

Conclusion: The preliminary findings support the feasibility of adapting Transformer-based ML models for FPGA hardware in High-Energy Physics applications.

Abstract: The Transformer Machine Learning (ML) architecture has been gaining
considerable momentum in recent years. In particular, computational High-Energy
Physics tasks such as jet tagging and particle track reconstruction (tracking),
have either achieved proper solutions, or reached considerable milestones using
Transformers. On the other hand, the use of specialised hardware accelerators,
especially FPGAs, is an effective method to achieve online, or pseudo-online
latencies. The development and integration of Transformer-based ML to FPGAs is
still ongoing and the support from current tools is very limited to
non-existent. Additionally, FPGA resources present a significant constraint.
Considering the model size alone, while smaller models can be deployed
directly, larger models are to be partitioned in a meaningful and ideally,
automated way. We aim to develop methodologies and tools for monolithic, or
partitioned Transformer synthesis, specifically targeting inference. Our
primary use-case involves two machine learning model designs for tracking,
derived from the TrackFormers project. We elaborate our development approach,
present preliminary results, and provide comparisons.

Result: The proposed methods improve the accuracy and possibly the efficiency of particle track reconstruction models.

Conclusion: The developments present a scalable tracking model solution capable of meeting next-generation High-Energy Physics experimental demands.

Abstract: High-Energy Physics experiments are rapidly escalating in generated data
volume, a trend that will intensify with the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC
upgrade. This surge in data necessitates critical revisions across the data
processing pipeline, with particle track reconstruction being a prime candidate
for improvement. In our previous work, we introduced "TrackFormers", a
collection of Transformer-based one-shot encoder-only models that effectively
associate hits with expected tracks. In this study, we extend our earlier
efforts by incorporating loss functions that account for inter-hit
correlations, conducting detailed investigations into (various) Transformer
attention mechanisms, and a study on the reconstruction of higher-level
objects. Furthermore we discuss new datasets that allow the training on hit
level for a range of physics processes. These developments collectively aim to
boost both the accuracy, and potentially the efficiency of our tracking models,
offering a robust solution to meet the demands of next-generation high-energy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for solving partial differential equations on complex CAD geometries in engineering applications efficiently and accurately.

Method: The framework utilizes patch-local neural networks operating on isogeometric analysis reference domains, enforces solution conformity across interfaces using interface neural networks, and trains using a variational framework minimizing the energy functional derived from the PDE’s weak form.

Result: The proposed method successfully solved two challenging use cases—a 2D magnetostatics model and a 3D nonlinear solid/contact mechanics model—with results closely matching high-fidelity finite element solutions.

Conclusion: The neural solver demonstrated strong potential for solving intricate engineering problems on CAD-based designs, showcasing its accuracy and versatility.

Abstract: This work develops a computational framework that combines physics-informed
neural networks with multi-patch isogeometric analysis to solve partial
differential equations on complex computer-aided design geometries. The method
utilizes patch-local neural networks that operate on the reference domain of
isogeometric analysis. A custom output layer enables the strong imposition of
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Solution conformity across interfaces between
non-uniform rational B-spline patches is enforced using dedicated interface
neural networks. Training is performed using the variational framework by
minimizing the energy functional derived after the weak form of the partial
differential equation. The effectiveness of the suggested method is
demonstrated on two highly non-trivial and practically relevant use-cases,
namely, a 2D magnetostatics model of a quadrupole magnet and a 3D nonlinear
solid and contact mechanics model of a mechanical holder. The results show
excellent agreement to reference solutions obtained with high-fidelity finite
