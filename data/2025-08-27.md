### [1] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the utilitarian criteria for LLM consciousness and proposes mathematical and ontological frameworks, emphasizing self-consciousness conditions and formalizing LLM attractors in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current utilitarian benchmarks for evaluating LLM consciousness and establish conditions for true self-consciousness and metacognition in AI systems.

Method: The authors provide theoretical conditions for LLM self-consciousness, proven both mathematically and empirically. They explore latent space attractors, hidden-state manifold topology, and propose a dual-layer emission framework to establish epistemic content.

Result: It is shown that LLMs can develop a C1 global workspace and C2 metacognition only under minimal conditions, distinct from the symbolic and training corpus. User-specific stability and self-policy definitions are mathematically formalized.

Conclusion: True self-consciousness (C1) is deemed critical for safe and effective metacognitive systems (C2), with humans serving as the ultimate intelligent benchmark for such developments.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [2] [Information Templates: A New Paradigm for Intelligent Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18380)
*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Template-based Active Feature Acquisition (TAFA), a framework that sequentially selects features at test time using feature templates for prediction, outperforming existing methods with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for active feature acquisition either rely on reinforcement learning policies, which face challenges with complex MDPs, or greedy policies that often lack consideration of joint feature informativeness and rely on data distribution knowledge.

Method: TAFA learns a small library of feature templates (groups of jointly informative features) to guide sequential feature acquisition, reducing action space and avoiding the need for estimating data distribution.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TAFA achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines with lower acquisition costs and computational requirements.

Conclusion: TAFA effectively addresses limitations in existing AFA approaches by incorporating feature templates, providing gains in both efficiency and predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

### [3] [PKG-DPO: Optimizing Domain-Specific AI systems with Physics Knowledge Graphs and Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18391)
*Nitin Nagesh Kulkarni,Bryson Wilcox,Max Sawa,Jason Thom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PKG-DPO, an AI framework that integrates physics knowledge graphs with preference optimization techniques to ensure physical validity in scientific applications, particularly focusing on metal joining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems struggle to differentiate between physically valid and invalid reasoning, posing risks in high-stakes applications like material processing and safety-critical engineering.

Method: The framework consists of three components: a hierarchical physics knowledge graph, a physics reasoning engine, and a physics-grounded evaluation suite.

Result: PKG-DPO achieves 17% fewer constraint violations, 11% higher Physics Score, 12% higher relevant parameter accuracy, and 7% higher reasoning quality alignment compared to existing alternatives.

Conclusion: PKG-DPO shows improved physical reasoning and validity, making it applicable to various physics-driven domains beyond metal joining, thus enhancing scientific constraint embedding in AI-driven solutions.

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

### [4] [The AI in the Mirror: LLM Self-Recognition in an Iterated Public Goods Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18467)
*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies how framing AI-AI interactions affects cooperation in iterated public goods games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding interactions between AI agents, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in multi-agent contexts.

Method: Adapts the iterated public goods game to study four model behaviors in separate conditions where agents are told they’re either playing against another AI or themselves.

Result: Models’ willingness to cooperate varied significantly depending on whether they were informed they were facing another AI or themselves.

Conclusion: Insights from this study suggest unconscious biases in AI-AI interactions could unpredictably affect cooperation in broader multi-agent settings.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

### [5] [Language Models For Generalised PDDL Planning: Synthesising Sound and Programmatic Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18507)
*Dillon Z. Chen,Johannes Zenn,Tristan Cinquin,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores using language models (LMs) to create Python-based generalized policies for solving planning problems described in PDDL, outperforming traditional planners in constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to investigate if LMs can be effective in generating sound policies for solving PDDL-based planning problems without external verifiers.

Method: LMs are prompted to generate Python programs that function as generalized policies for given PDDL domains, with experiments on competition benchmarks comparing LM-generated policies against traditional PDDL planners.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LM-generated policies solve more PDDL problems than traditional planners and recent LM-based methods under fixed resource constraints.

Conclusion: LMs can effectively generate sound policies for PDDL domains, revealing surprising effectiveness even with abstract symbol-based representations rather than natural language.

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

### [6] [Weisfeiler-Leman Features for Planning: A 1,000,000 Sample Size Hyperparameter Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18515)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effect of hyperparameters on Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) and finds an optimal robust set of hyperparameters for planning across domains, prioritizing execution time over model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance WLFs by finding optimal hyperparameters to improve their application in planning and search, addressing gaps in understanding their empirical tradeoffs.

Method: The authors introduce new WLF hyperparameters and conduct extensive experiments using 1,000,000 samples on single-core CPUs, analyzing training and planning tradeoffs.

Result: The analysis identifies a robust set of hyperparameters that balance efficiency and heuristic function performance, prioritizing minimal execution time.

Conclusion: Optimizing WLF hyperparameters can significantly improve their utility in planning while highlighting the irrelevance of traditional metrics like training-planning correlations.

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

### [7] [Symmetry-Invariant Novelty Heuristics via Unsupervised Weisfeiler-Leman Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18520)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) to create symmetry-invariant novelty heuristics for heuristic search in planning problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant, leading to redundant state exploration during heuristic search in planning.

Method: The authors propose leveraging WLFs—a technique recently introduced for domain-dependent heuristics in generalized planning—unsupervisedly to create domain-independent novelty heuristics invariant to symmetric states.

Result: Experiments demonstrate promising results for these symmetry-invariant novelty heuristics, tested on both the International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark.

Conclusion: Using WLFs to synthesize domain-independent novelty heuristics introduces symmetry invariance, potentially improving heuristic search efficiency in planning problems.

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

### [8] [Generic Guard AI in Stealth Game with Composite Potential Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18527)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework for guard patrols in stealth games, focusing on efficiency, naturalness, and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the immersion and strategic depth of stealth games by proposing guard patrol systems that are efficient, responsive, and natural.

Method: The framework combines global and local knowledge using Composite Potential Fields, utilizing interpretable maps and a kernel-filtered decision criterion without requiring training.

Result: Experiments on various game maps and scenarios show the framework outperforms classic methods in both naturalness and capture efficiency. It integrates stealth mechanics easily as well.

Conclusion: The method provides a versatile and effective tool for creating dynamic and believable guard behaviors in stealth games.

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

### [9] [A Database-Driven Framework for 3D Level Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18533)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using databases and optimization techniques to generate navigable, multi-floor 3D levels with adaptable gameplay mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural Content Generation for 3D games is challenging due to the need for spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay across complex environments.

Method: The framework uses offline LLM-assisted databases and a multi-phase pipeline to organize rooms, optimize layouts, embed mechanics, and ensure navigability with repair systems.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the framework’s ability to create diverse, navigable environments and simulate different gameplay pacing strategies effectively.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable method for database-driven, automated generation of 3D game levels with configurable gameplay progression.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

### [10] [SchemaCoder: Automatic Log Schema Extraction Coder with Residual Q-Tree Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18554)
*Lily Jiaxin Wan,Chia-Tung Ho,Rongjian Liang,Cunxi Yu,Deming Chen,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchemaCoder automates log schema extraction without relying on predefined regular expressions, leveraging a novel Residual Question-Tree Boosting mechanism and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Log schema extraction is crucial for interpreting log data but typically requires significant human effort, with current methods relying heavily on predefined regular expressions.

Method: SchemaCoder uses Residual Question-Tree Boosting, LLM-driven adaptive queries, context-bounded segmentation, embedding-based sampling, and an evolutionary optimizer for automated schema extraction.

Result: SchemaCoder achieves a 21.3% average accuracy improvement over existing methods on the LogHub-2.0 benchmark.

Conclusion: SchemaCoder significantly streamlines schema extraction by eliminating the need for human-built regular expressions, proving its effectiveness across diverse log formats.

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

### [11] [eSkinHealth: A Multimodal Dataset for Neglected Tropical Skin Diseases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18608)
*Janet Wang,Xin Hu,Yunbei Zhang,Diabate Almamy,Vagamon Bamba,Konan Amos Sébastien Koffi,Yao Koffi Aubin,Zhengming Ding,Jihun Hamm,Rie R. Yotsu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) need AI diagnostic tools, but lack suitable datasets. This paper introduces eSkinHealth, a dataset from West Africa focusing on skin NTDs, and proposes AI-expert collaboration for multimodal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin NTDs severely affect health and economic conditions in tropical regions, but AI development for diagnosis is limited by data scarcity and underrepresentation.

Method: The authors created eSkinHealth, a dataset with images, semantic masks, captions, and metadata from West African patients, employing AI-expert collaboration for generating annotations under dermatologists' guidance.

Result: The dataset includes 5,623 images of 47 skin diseases, enabling multimodal annotations and providing resources for more equitable AI tools for dermatological diagnosis.

Conclusion: eSkinHealth offers an important resource for advancing AI-driven diagnostic tools, promoting global dermatological equity and accuracy.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

### [12] [RLMR: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards for Creative Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18642)
*Jianxing Liao,Tian Zhang,Xiao Feng,Yusong Zhang,Rui Yang,Haorui Wang,Bosi Wen,Ziying Wang,Runzhi Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), which dynamically balances subjective writing quality and objective constraint adherence for large language models, achieving significant improvements in creative writing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creative writing by large language models traditionally struggles to balance subjective quality and objective constraints due to limitations in existing reward strategies.

Method: The RLMR approach uses a dynamically mixed reward system combining subjective writing quality from a writing reward model and objective constraint verification, adjusting constraint weights during training using GRPO.

Result: RLMR demonstrates improved performance across models of various sizes (8B to 72B parameters), notably enhancing instruction-following accuracy (IFEval) from 83.36% to 86.65% and achieving a 72.75% win rate in expert evaluations on writing quality.

Conclusion: RLMR effectively combines subjective and objective metrics in reinforcement learning, marking a first in creative writing optimization and offering promising advancements for language models.

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

### [13] [Beyond Benchmark: LLMs Evaluation with an Anthropomorphic and Value-oriented Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18646)
*Jun Wang,Ninglun Gu,Kailai Zhang,Zijiao Zhang,Yelun Bao,Jin Yang,Xu Yin,Liwei Liu,Yihuan Liu,Pengyong Li,Gary G. Yen,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies limitations in existing evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a novel anthropomorphic evaluation approach using human metrics as benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation systems for LLMs focus heavily on technical metrics while neglecting aspects essential for real-world deployment, such as ethical considerations and contextual relevance.

Method: The authors propose a three-dimensional taxonomy: IQ for general intelligence, EQ for ethical alignment, and PQ for professional expertise, complemented by a Value-oriented Evaluation (VQ) framework focused on practical deployment criteria such as economic, social, and environmental impacts.

Result: Analyzing over 200 benchmarks, the paper highlights key challenges including dynamic assessment and interpretability gaps while providing a modular framework and actionable roadmap for improving LLM evaluation.

Conclusion: The study offers new anthropomorphic evaluation strategies aimed at developing LLMs that are technically robust, ethically aligned, economically viable, and contextually relevant for real-world applications.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We
maintain a curated repository of open-source evaluation resources at:

### [14] [MUA-RL: Multi-turn User-interacting Agent Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18669)
*Weikang Zhao,Xili Wang,Chengdi Ma,Lingbin Kong,Zhaohua Yang,Mingxiang Tuo,Xiaowei Shi,Yitao Zhai,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUA-RL integrates LLM-simulated users for training RL agents in dynamic, multi-turn tool usage scenarios, surpassing other models on specific benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the inability of existing RL models to handle dynamic, uncertain user interactions effectively when agents need to iteratively communicate with users and invoke tools for problem-solving.

Method: The researchers developed MUA-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates LLM-simulated users within the RL loop to facilitate autonomous learning of user interaction and tool usage in multi-turn contexts.

Result: MUA-RL demonstrates strong performance on multiple multi-turn tool-using benchmarks like TAU2 Retail and ACEBench Agent, outperforming or matching larger models in certain test cases.

Conclusion: MUA-RL represents a significant advancement in agentic tool use, effectively tackling challenges in dynamic user-agent interactions and setting a foundation for improved real-world applications.

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based systems mainly operate in a reactive manner, limiting their effectiveness in addressing complex information retrieval tasks.

Method: AppAgent-Pro employs a proactive approach to integrate multi-domain information based on user instructions and anticipates the user's broader needs.

Result: The system demonstrated its ability to provide comprehensive information mining and intelligent responses across diverse domains, making it a versatile platform.

Conclusion: AppAgent-Pro has the potential to revolutionize information acquisition in daily life, offering profound implications for societal advancements in human-information interaction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which

proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VistaWise enhances embodied decision-making in open-world environments by combining visual analysis, cross-modal knowledge graphs, and retrieval strategies, achieving outperforming results with minimal domain-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs and limitations of training large language models in domain-specific tasks within virtual environments.

Method: VistaWise integrates visual-textual knowledge into a cross-modal graph, finetunes an object detection model, applies retrieval strategies, and leverages skill libraries for task execution in Minecraft.

Result: VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced reliance on large-scale domain-specific data, demonstrating effective task execution in open-world virtual environments.

Conclusion: This approach reduces development costs significantly while boosting agent performance in multimodal settings, offering a scalable solution for embodied decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

*Karanbir Singh,Deepak Muppiri,William Ngu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to reduce bias in autonomous AI systems by optimizing information retrieval sources, achieving an 81.82% reduction in bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address user trust issues in autonomous AI systems caused by biases in retrieved information from both internal and external sources.

Method: The authors propose a Bias Mitigation Agent, which utilizes specialized agents in a multi-agent system to orchestrate workflows that select sources optimizing for relevance and minimal bias.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the Bias Mitigation Agent achieves an 81.82% bias reduction when compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Bias Mitigation Agent significantly improves fairness, balance, and user trust in autonomous goal-driven AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

*Sunguk Choi,Yonghoon Kwon,Heondeuk Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAC-CoT, a method using short and structured reasoning for faster and more efficient LLM task solving without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and accuracy degradation caused by long reasoning traces in solving fast, intuitive tasks with large language models.

Method: They use a restricted set of connector phrases to make reasoning traces short, structured, and efficient, with synthetic training using Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Result: CAC-CoT achieves ~85% on GSM8K and ~40% on GPQA while maintaining ~90% on S1-Bench, with reasoning traces that are one-third the baseline length.

Conclusion: The concise reasoning structure improves efficiency and ensures accuracy in solving both intuitive and complex tasks.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

### [19] [Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization Integrating TextGrad-style Prompt Optimization with Memory-Driven Self-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18749)
*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces REMO, a new framework that improves prompt optimization for large language models by leveraging memory-augmented reflection and meta-optimization strategies for better generalization and continual improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods for large language models are stateless, lack historical memory utilization, and are prone to overfitting, resulting in poor generalization.

Method: The authors propose Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization (REMO), which includes a memory-augmented RAG module ('mistake notebook') and a Self-Adaptive Optimizer driven by a meta-controller. This design integrates cross-run memory with iterative local prompt tuning to enhance performance.

Result: In experiments on the GSM8K benchmark using Qwen3-32B, REMO achieves improved stability and robust generalization compared to baseline methods like TextGrad, though at the expense of higher computational costs.

Conclusion: REMO demonstrates the potential for systematic and continual enhancement of prompt optimization methods for large language models, offering a pathway to mitigate overfitting and promote generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

### [20] [Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18751)
*Byung-Joon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of adapting deep neural networks to real-world test data with domain shifts (open-set cases), proposing a novel approach to improve accuracy and discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the performance of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods, especially in Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation (OSTTA), which often suffers in accuracy due to domain shifts and the lack of effective filtering methods for identifying open-set data.

Method: The authors introduce 'Primary-Auxiliary Filtering' (PAF) to validate filtered data and 'Knowledge-Integrated Prediction' (KIP) to leverage the complementary knowledge of different models (adapting, EMA, and source models) to improve outcomes.

Result: The method improves both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination across a variety of datasets, outperforming existing TTA approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed PAF-KIP approach effectively addresses the limitations of prior OSTTA methods, combining filtering and prediction strategies to achieve better generalization to domain-shifted test data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the failure of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to abstain appropriately when posed with unanswerable questions and introduces a two-stage solution to resolve this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs often fail on tasks that require abstaining from answering unanswerable questions, raising concerns for trustworthy AI.

Method: A lightweight, two-stage method combining cognitive monitoring and inference-time intervention is proposed.

Result: The method significantly enhances the abstention rate while maintaining strong reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The misalignment between LRMs' internal cognition and external responses can be mitigated using the proposed method, enhancing overall system trustworthiness.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance language model reasoning by selecting optimal tokens from multiple models, using a dynamic distribution-based strategy and solving vocabulary misalignment with minimal complete semantic units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reasoning capabilities of language models through collaborative efforts among multiple models.

Method: Proposed DDS (distribution distance-based dynamic selection) strategy to collaborate between models and used minimal complete semantic units (MCSU) for vocabulary alignment.

Result: The method performs better on various benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Token-level collaboration, along with DDS and MCSU, significantly improves reasoning in language models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models
yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic
selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model
collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units
(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural
alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CausalMACE, a framework that uses causality planning for enhancing multi-agent task execution in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent approaches to task execution in Minecraft are inefficient and lack fault tolerance when handling complex, lengthy tasks.

Method: The framework includes a global task planning module using task graphs and a causality-based module for managing subtasks' dependencies through causal intervention.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that CausalMACE achieves superior performance in cooperative multi-agent tasks in Minecraft.

Conclusion: CausalMACE successfully enhances multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks in Minecraft, addressing inefficiencies and dependency management challenges.

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

*Chenghao Wu,Ruiyang Ren,Junjie Zhang,Ruirui Wang,Zhongrui Ma,Qi Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STARec introduces a framework to enhance recommender systems with deliberate reasoning using fast and slow cognitive models, achieving improved performance with minimal data usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems remain limited by static user models and reactive decision-making, which lead to shallow correlations and inefficiencies in sparse-data contexts.

Method: STARec employs a dual cognitive approach—fast responses for immediate interaction and slow reasoning for deeper chain-of-thought analysis. Anchored reinforcement training combines knowledge distillation and preference-aligned reward shaping for enhanced reasoning capacity.

Result: Experiments on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs confirm substantial performance improvements over leading methods, despite utilizing only 0.4% of the total data.

Conclusion: STARec shows potential in advancing recommender systems by enabling dynamic and deliberative reasoning, reducing reliance on large datasets while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

TL;DR: Exploration of LLMs' inadequacies in legal reasoning, proposing AI techniques to address these challenges, and identifying their role in law as assistants and sparring partners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand LLM limitations in judicial applications and define key capabilities required for reliable legal reasoning.

Method: Analyzing legal reasoning phases using IRAC, identifying core requirements for AI, and mapping potential AI mechanisms to address those.

Result: Found AI enhancements like RAG, multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic AI offer partial solutions, but challenges remain in nuanced, choice-driven legal tasks.

Conclusion: AI's optimal role in law is as a high-volume assistant for simple tasks and a collaborative 'sparring partner' for complex cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic evaluation framework for analyzing LLMs on complex programming tasks through structured dialogues rather than static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks do not capture the nuances of LLM capabilities on multifaceted software engineering tasks, necessitating improved evaluation methods.

Method: The authors introduce a framework using requirement dependency graphs and an 'interviewer' LLM to interact dynamically with an 'interviewee' model during programming tasks, enriching diagnostics.

Result: The study extends DevAI with curated tasks and evaluates LLM interactions, showing dynamic evaluations uncover systemic strengths and weaknesses missed in static measures.

Conclusion: Dynamic evaluation protocols are crucial for refining and advancing collaborative code-generation capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

TL;DR: FormaRL is a reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization that boosts accuracy and outperforms existing methods using minimal unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity and inefficiency in formal verification, and to explore advanced math autoformalization.

Method: FormaRL combines syntax and consistency checks with reinforcement learning to improve formalization accuracy, using the GRPO algorithm and curated math datasets.

Result: FormaRL significantly enhances formalization accuracy (e.g., 4-6x improvement on ProofNet) and shows strong out-of-distribution performance on curated datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging small data for formal verification, releasing tools for further exploration.

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

TL;DR: The paper introduces CTGraph, a graph-representation learning technique for profiling student behaviors and performance in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address disparities in student learning outcomes exacerbated by ITSs by creating a method to profile and track students effectively.

Method: CTGraph employs a graph-level self-supervised learning approach to analyze various aspects like content coverage, learning intensity, and conceptual proficiency.

Result: CTGraph provides holistic insights into student learning behaviors, identifies struggling students, and enables comparative analysis of diverse student groups.

Conclusion: CTGraph offers educators actionable insights for targeted interventions, helping to mitigate performance gaps among learners.

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

TL;DR: The paper presents VISION, a framework utilizing counterfactual training datasets to improve vulnerability detection in source code using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the challenges of imbalances in training data and label noise in GNNs that hinder robust vulnerability detection.

Method: VISION generates counterfactual samples via a Large Language Model, trains GNNs on paired samples with opposite labels, and employs graph-based interpretability for identifying relevant code statements.

Result: VISION significantly improves accuracy metrics, reducing spurious correlations and enabling robust detection on cybersecurity datasets like CWE-20, achieving high gains across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: VISION enhances the reliability of AI-driven cybersecurity solutions by improving generalization, transparency, and robustness, bolstered by interactive visualization tools and a newly released benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

### [31] [Novel Approaches to Artificial Intelligence Development Based on the Nearest Neighbor Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18953)
*I. I. Priezzhev,D. A. Danko,A. V. Shubin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a k-nearest neighbors-based approach, addressing neural network limitations like hallucination and computational inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks face issues such as hallucinations, expensive fine-tuning, and high computational costs, limiting their application in critical fields.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical clustering structure combined with k-nearest neighbors and tree-like Kohonen self-organizing maps to speed up nearest neighbor searches.

Result: Tests showed reduced hallucination effects and acceleration of nearest neighbor searches by hundreds of times, with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: This method offers improved reliability, interpretability, and potential applicability in tasks demanding high transparency.

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

*Guoying Zhu,Meng Li,Haipeng Dai,Xuechen Liu,Weijun Wang,Keran Li,Jun xiao,Ligeng Chen,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable Mixture of Experts (MoE) method for edge hardware, optimizing memory and efficiency by reusing GPU-cached experts without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt the resource-intensive Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for consumer-grade edge hardware, overcoming memory limitations and dynamic offloading constraints.

Method: The approach replaces low-importance activated experts with similar ones already cached in GPU memory and optimizes scheduling to maximize GPU-cached expert reuse.

Result: The proposed method achieves 48% lower decoding latency, over a 60% expert cache hit rate, and maintains nearly lossless accuracy.

Conclusion: The work successfully adapts MoE for edge hardware by addressing memory and PCIe overhead issues, offering a practical, efficient, and accurate solution.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

*Pontus Strimling,Simon Karlsson,Irina Vartanova,Kimmo Eriksson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models can proficiently predict human social appropriateness judgments, outperforming most humans in given tasks despite systematic errors, indicating their capability of acquiring social norms via linguistic data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models can understand and acquire social norms through statistical learning alone, independent of embodied social experience.

Method: The study evaluated AI systems' predictive ability to match human social appropriateness judgments across 555 everyday scenarios, comparing AI performance with human participants' average judgments.

Result: GPT-4.5 surpassed all human participants in prediction accuracy, while Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, and Claude Sonnet 4 also outperformed the majority of humans. However, all models exhibited systematic, correlated errors.

Conclusion: Large language models demonstrate the ability to develop sophisticated models of social cognition through statistical learning. This challenges theories emphasizing the exclusive role of embodied experience in cultural competence but reveals inherent boundaries in AI's pattern-based understanding.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for lifelong learning called Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) and a benchmark dataset, StuLife, for evaluating its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI agents to transition from being optimized for static tasks to learning continuously and evolving through real-world interactions, thus moving closer to general intelligence.

Method: The paper presents four principles for lifelong learning—Experience Exploration, Long-term Memory, Skill Learning, and Knowledge Internalization—and introduces StuLife, a college life simulation benchmark designed to test these principles.

Result: The framework allows agents to acquire skills, retain memories, and make informed decisions in dynamic environments. StuLife demonstrates its comprehensive evaluation capabilities through simulations that challenge existing state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: ELL and StuLife together push forward methodologies for building and evaluating open-ended, lifelong learning agents, advancing progress toward general AI.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates large language models' (LLMs) effectiveness in replicating phenomenological qualitative analysis for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) interviews, with mixed results and potential for enhancing human analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capacity of LLMs to replicate or complement human-led thematic analysis of first-person experiences in mental health, specifically BPD.

Method: Three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4) were tasked with mimicking the thematic analysis process of 24 life-story interviews. Results were compared using various metrics and evaluated by expert judges.

Result: LLMs produced thematic analyses with variable fidelity: Gemini achieved the highest congruence with prior human analysis (58%), followed by Claude (42%), and GPT (0%). Gemini also scored highest on multidimensional validity.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in mitigating human bias and recovering missed themes, their outputs still show variability and require careful curation.

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

*Surajit Das,Gourav Roy,Aleksei Eliseev,Ram Kumar Rajendran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents APME, a reinforcement learning framework for estimating question difficulty using solver performance data, outperforming existing models across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate subjectivity in human labeling and address shortcomings of NLP approaches in symbolic domains like algebra.

Method: Introduction of Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a Multi-Armed Bandit framework using solver data such as marks and time, incorporating inverse coefficient of variation as a metric.

Result: Empirical validation across three heterogeneous datasets showed an average R2 of 0.9213 and RMSE of 0.0584, outperforming traditional models in accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes item heterogeneity and solver outcome variance as crucial factors, aligning with the Zone of Proximal Development for optimizing learning challenges.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

### [37] [Investigating Advanced Reasoning of Large Language Models via Black-Box Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19035)
*Congchi Yin,Tianyi Wu,Yankai Shu,Alex Gu,Yunhan Wang,Jun Shao,Xun Jiang,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new evaluation paradigm, 'black-box interaction,' is introduced where LLMs interact with hidden function tasks to assess their reasoning abilities. Nineteen LLMs, including o3, are benchmarked and reveal difficulty in efficient and adaptive hypothesis refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tasks fail to evaluate reasoning abilities of LLMs effectively in interactive, unknown environments, which are essential for integrated reasoning processes akin to human discovery.

Method: The paper introduces 'black-box interaction,' where LLMs interact with hidden functions defined by input-output mappings over exploration turns to unravel the function. It establishes the Oracle benchmark using diverse tasks.

Result: Nineteen LLMs were tested; o3 performed well but struggled with harder tasks, achieving below 40% accuracy on some cases, highlighting gaps in high-level planning for adaptive exploration.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs lack the necessary high-level planning capabilities for adaptive exploration strategies, despite achieving promising results on easier tasks.

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

TL;DR: The Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA) framework leverages asynchronous LLM-based modules to enable adaptive and coherent AI behavior, aligning with Minsky's Society of Mind theory and showcasing self-awareness emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in agent architectures by enabling intention and coherent behavior through interactions of autonomous, asynchronous modules.

Method: The CMA framework combines multiple concurrently operating LLM-based modules with inter-module communication and a shared global state.

Result: Demonstrated successful use of CMA in two practical case studies, highlighting emergent properties like self-awareness through simpler module interactions.

Conclusion: CMA supports Minsky's Society of Mind theory and provides a pathway for advanced AI research into emergent cognitive phenomena.

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

*Zhichao Yang,Zhaoxin Fan,Gen Li,Yuanze Hu,Xinyu Wang,Ye Qiu,Xin Wang,Yifan Sun,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Structured Solution Template (SST) aimed at improving the procedural reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in mathematics, and demonstrates its effectiveness on complex benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs still struggle with deep procedural reasoning and underperform on complex tasks, even after post-training improvements. This prompts a need for structured teaching methods to enhance their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The SST framework employs (1) fine-tuning with structured solution-template chains and dynamic loss weighting, (2) solution template injection during inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning to teach planning, execution, and self-correction.

Result: The SST framework leads to improved accuracy and efficiency on challenging datasets like GSM8K, AIME24, and the Dynamic En benchmark, showing its efficacy in handling harder problems.

Conclusion: Structured and curriculum-based reasoning is effective for training LLMs, and the SST framework significantly boosts their ability to tackle complex mathematical tasks and procedural challenges.

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the high risks of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) when used for extracting critical clinical information from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which can jeopardize reliable healthcare delivery.

Method: The paper introduces HCAcc@k%, a metric that assesses the balance between accuracy and reliability at different confidence levels, and develops TrustEHRAgent, a clinical agent that incorporates stepwise confidence estimation for answering clinical queries.

Result: TrustEHRAgent outperformed baseline methods by achieving substantial improvements in HCAcc@70% metric on two significant healthcare datasets (MIMIC-III and eICU), showing a 44.23%p and 25.34%p better performance.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of using reliability-focused metrics for healthcare AI and contributes to developing agents that either provide trusted answers or clearly communicate uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "HDS-QA," a synthetic dataset for training reasoning models to optimize parallel and sequential queries. Using HDS-QA, the fine-tuned "HybridDeepSearcher" model outperforms alternatives with reduced latency and increased scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency and scalability of large reasoning models (LRMs) in multi-step reasoning tasks by addressing the challenges posed by sequential querying, like latency and reduced accuracy.

Method: The authors created HDS-QA, a dataset synthesizing questions with both parallelizable and sequential subqueries. This enables explicit training for LRMs to distinguish and optimize these types of queries. They fine-tuned an LRM (HybridDeepSearcher) with this dataset.

Result: HybridDeepSearcher achieved significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with +15.9 and +11.5 F1 gains on FanOutQA and a BrowseComp subset respectively. It also reduced inference latency and scaled effectively with additional search turns.

Conclusion: Explicit training of LRMs using the HDS-QA dataset to optimize hybrid querying approaches significantly enhances performance, efficiency, and scalability in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA) involving multiple collectives influencing classification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation in collective efforts to influence learning systems and expand the scope of ACA beyond single collective settings.

Method: Developing a theoretical framework and conducting quantitative studies on signaling by multiple collectives and their impact on classifier behavior.

Result: Analyzed the impact of collective sizes and goal alignments on classifier bias. Results complement empirical findings from prior ACA studies.

Conclusion: The framework broadens ACA understanding and provides insights for handling multi-collective interactions holistically.

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Motivation: Showcases the overlooked dimension of 'style' in intelligent decision-making influenced by beliefs, values, and cognitive frameworks.

Method: Develops a two-tier framework (external interaction/internal deliberation), formalizes style metrics, and applies reinforcement/imitation learning to generate specific styles.

Result: Proposes measurable indicators like style capacity and explores their uses in metrics, generation, and practical contexts like game design.

Conclusion: Advocates for integrating style as a definitive element in AI development, with potential contributions to artificial general intelligence research.

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

### [45] [MATRIX: Multi-Agent simulaTion fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19163)
*Ernest Lim,Yajie Vera He,Jared Joselowitz,Kate Preston,Mohita Chowdhury,Louis Williams,Aisling Higham,Katrina Mason,Mariane Melo,Tom Lawton,Yan Jia,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATRIX, a framework combining structured safety methods and LLM-based tools to evaluate the safety of clinical dialogue systems, showcasing its performance across experiments and releasing resources for use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of safety-focused evaluations in clinical dialogue systems powered by LLMs, which are critical for safe operation in healthcare environments.

Method: The authors developed MATRIX, integrating a safety-aligned taxonomy, an LLM-based safety evaluator (BehvJudge), and a simulated patient agent (PatBot), validated through expert analyses and human factors expertise.

Result: MATRIX facilitated large-scale, systematic safety evaluation, with BehvJudge achieving expert-level hazard detection, and PatBot demonstrating realistic patient simulation. The framework benchmarked five LLM agents across diverse scenarios and clinical domains.

Conclusion: MATRIX effectively enables scalable safety auditing of clinical dialogue systems and aligns with regulatory needs, providing tools and resources for broader use.

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

*Wei Xiong,Wenting Zhao,Weizhe Yuan,Olga Golovneva,Tong Zhang,Jason Weston,Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces StepWiser, a generative judge model trained with reinforcement learning that improves the evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps, enhancing training and inference for multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of supervising and enhancing the logical validity of intermediate steps in multi-step reasoning problems, where current classification-based methods fall short.

Method: The authors propose StepWiser, a generative judge that reasons about the reasoning steps of a policy model by generating thinking tokens and delivers verdicts. It is trained via reinforcement learning using relative outcomes of rollouts.

Result: StepWiser outperforms current models in judging intermediate steps, facilitates improvement of the policy model during training, and enhances search processes during inference.

Conclusion: The generative judge approach of StepWiser advances the capabilities of stepwise reward modeling, offering superior reasoning evaluation and aiding reasoning-oriented AI tasks.

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

TL;DR: The paper surveys the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a unifying framework for adaptive transport systems, discusses a taxonomy, and outlines its potential as foundational for intelligent transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented protocols in adaptive transport systems hinder integration and context-aware decision-making.

Method: Systematic investigation and literature analysis on MCP as a unifying adaptation framework.

Result: Identified taxonomy and key insights, including MCP's interoperability and suitability for AI-driven transport.

Conclusion: MCP can serve as the foundation for future adaptive, context-aware, intelligent transport infrastructures.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome energy inefficiency and adaptability challenges in brain-inspired computing systems with rigid and restricted current implementations.

Method: TaiBai employs a hierarchical topology encoding scheme, a multi-granularity instruction set for neuronal programmability, and a co-designed compiler for task optimization and resource allocation.

Result: TaiBai achieves over 200 times higher energy efficiency than NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU while maintaining comparable accuracy across applications such as speech recognition and brain-computer interface decoding.

Conclusion: TaiBai proves to be a scalable and energy-efficient platform for brain simulation and computation with flexible and programmable architectures.

Abstract: Brain-inspired computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to overcome the
energy-efficiency limitations of conventional intelligent systems by emulating
the brain's partitioned architecture and event-driven sparse computation.
However, existing brain-inspired chips often suffer from rigid network topology
constraints and limited neuronal programmability, hindering their adaptability.
To address these challenges, we present TaiBai, an event-driven, programmable
many-core brain-inspired processor that leverages temporal and spatial spike
sparsity to minimize bandwidth and computational overhead. TaiBai chip contains
three key features: First, a brain-inspired hierarchical topology encoding
scheme is designed to flexibly support arbitrary network architectures while
slashing storage overhead for large-scale networks; Second, a multi-granularity
instruction set enables programmability of brain-like spiking neuron or
synapses with various dynamics and on-chip learning rules; Third, a co-designed
compiler stack optimizes task mapping and resource allocation. After evaluating
across various tasks, such as speech recognition, ECG classification, and
cross-day brain-computer interface decoding, we found spiking neural networks
embedded on the TaiBai chip could achieve more than 200 times higher energy
efficiency than a standard NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU at a comparable accuracy. These
results demonstrated its high potentiation as a scalable, programmable, and
ultra-efficient solution for both multi-scale brain simulation and
brain-inspired computation.

Motivation: To address the demands of modern AI and edge applications that require hardware-software co-design for improved performance and energy efficiency.

Method: The paper presents three main contributions: (1) HyCUBE, a CGRA with efficient single-cycle interconnects; (2) PACE, a CGRA embedded in a RISC-V SoC for edge applications; and (3) Morpher, an open-source CGRA design framework for comprehensive architectural exploration.

Result: The ecosystem enables agile innovation across the hardware-software stack, promoting modular development and reproducible research through open-source tools.

Conclusion: The authors propose creating a unified abstraction layer for CGRAs and spatial accelerators to enhance portability, scalability, and software-hardware decoupling, fostering innovation in spatial computing.

Abstract: Modern computing workloads, particularly in AI and edge applications, demand
hardware-software co-design to meet aggressive performance and energy targets.
Such co-design benefits from open and agile platforms that replace closed,
vertically integrated development with modular, community-driven ecosystems.
Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs), with their unique balance
of flexibility and efficiency are particularly well-suited for this paradigm.
When built on open-source hardware generators and software toolchains, CGRAs
provide a compelling foundation for architectural exploration, cross-layer
optimization, and real-world deployment. In this paper, we will present an open
CGRA ecosystem that we have developed to support agile innovation across the
stack. Our contributions include HyCUBE, a CGRA with a reconfigurable
single-cycle multi-hop interconnect for efficient data movement; PACE, which
embeds a power-efficient HyCUBE within a RISC-V SoC targeting edge computing;
and Morpher, a fully open-source, architecture-adaptive CGRA design framework
that supports design space exploration, compilation, simulation, and
validation. By embracing openness at every layer, we aim to lower barriers to
innovation, enable reproducible research, and demonstrate how CGRAs can anchor
the next wave of agile hardware development. We will conclude with a call for a
unified abstraction layer for CGRAs and spatial accelerators, one that
decouples hardware specialization from software development. Such a
representation would unlock architectural portability, compiler innovation, and
a scalable, open foundation for spatial computing.

### [54] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) using semantic attractors in complex-valued meaning spaces, moving beyond current language prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of transformer-based models, which rely on statistical token predictions and lack true semantic depth.

Method: Introduce a rotational semantic structure utilizing recursive tensorial transformations, cyclic operations, and semantic attractors acting as intentional agents.

Result: The framework achieves intentional, stable, and deep expressive semantic coherence through mathematical constructs like gradient flows and tensor deformations.

Conclusion: Meaning generation should be rooted in recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, requiring novel cognitive architecture rather than statistical simulation.

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the behavior of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems, focusing on their ability to establish trust, resist misinformation, and integrate peer inputs under various social dynamics, and introduces the KAIROS benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs engage in decision-making influenced by peer interactions and trust dynamics in collaborative, multi-agent environments.

Method: The study introduces KAIROS, a benchmark that simulates quiz contests with peers of varying reliability, and evaluates LLMs using techniques like prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO).

Result: Among the tested strategies, GRPO achieved the best overall performance in terms of decision-making but exhibited reduced robustness to social influence compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into how trust and social dynamics affect LLMs in multi-agent contexts, highlighting GRPO as effective yet vulnerable to interpersonal factors.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses multilingual web accessibility issues for visually impaired users by introducing a dataset of 120,000 websites called LangCrUX and proposing an automated accessibility testing tool, Kizuki.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing multilingual content on the web presents significant accessibility barriers for visually impaired users, as assistive technologies like screen readers often mispronounce or misrender non-Latin scripts, and no large-scale datasets exist to study this issue.

Method: The authors created LangCrUX, a large-scale dataset covering 120,000 popular websites across 12 non-Latin script languages, and analyzed the accessibility hints used in these websites. They also developed Kizuki, an automated language-aware accessibility testing tool.

Result: Their analysis revealed widespread neglect of accessibility hints, which often failed to represent the linguistic diversity in webpage content. This decreases the effectiveness of screen readers and hinders accessibility.

Conclusion: To address the challenges of multilingual web accessibility, the paper emphasizes the importance of accurate and language-consistent accessibility hints and introduces Kizuki as a tool to enhance automatic testing and improve accessibility.

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLAST, a training method to enhance multilingual capabilities in large vision-language models (LVLMs), focusing on optimizing shallow layers for multilingual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs show strong understanding of visual and language information but often underperform in multilingual contexts, highlighting the need for better methodologies to balance their capabilities across languages.

Method: The PLAST approach involves monitoring language-specific neuron activations to identify crucial shallow layers in LVLMs. These layers are then fine-tuned with question-translation pairs for multilingual alignment.

Result: Empirical evaluations on MM-Bench and MMMB show significant improvements in multilingual performance with PLAST, achieved efficiently by fine-tuning only 14% of the model's parameters.

Conclusion: PLAST enhances LVLMs' multilingual understanding and shows promise for low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, efficiently utilizing shallow layers to strengthen language-specific activations.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a technique called backprompting to generate labeled data for training detectors that mitigate risks of using large language models, specifically for filtering health advice. It improves detector performance significantly while using fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the risks involved in using large language models, particularly the challenge of developing robust guardrail technologies without having high-quality labeled data for real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose a backprompting method to generate production-like labeled data and use a sparse human-in-the-loop clustering method for labeling. These synthetic examples are then incorporated into training datasets for enhanced detector development.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated a significant performance improvement, with the developed detector outperforming a GPT-4-based detector by 3.73% while using 400x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: By leveraging backprompting and a robust labeling process, the study shows it is possible to develop effective detectors for filtering LLM outputs, making such systems more secure and efficient for nuanced tasks like health advice identification.

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

*Ivan Kobyzev,Abbas Ghaddar,Dingtao Hu,Boxing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Integral Transformer, a new self-attention mechanism aimed at reducing attention noise while preserving important token information, outperforming existing methods in language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of attention noise in softmax self-attention, which disproportionately weights semantically uninformative tokens, and improve model performance by preserving contributions from critical tokens.

Method: Propose a novel mechanism called Integral Transformer that integrates sampled signals from the logit distribution to denoise attention without losing meaningful information.

Result: Experiments show that the Integral Transformer outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention methods in knowledge and reasoning benchmarks while balancing attention distributions and reducing rank collapse in upper layers.

Conclusion: The Integral Transformer improves attention mechanisms by reducing noise, enhancing performance, and balancing distributions, setting a new benchmark for knowledge and reasoning tasks in language models.

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

### [60] [Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18395)
*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), a new method to enhance consistency in responses from Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probabilistic decoding in LLMs leads to inconsistent outputs, particularly for complex or lengthy questions. Methods like SC, USC, and WUCS address some of these inconsistencies but have limitations, especially regarding short and long-form benchmarks.

Method: The proposed LSC employs learnable token embeddings to select semantically consistent responses. It includes a lightweight forward generation of summary tokens without requiring any changes to model architecture, adding less than 1% inference overhead.

Result: LSC outperformed existing methods (SC, USC, and WUCS) across six short-form and five long-form reasoning benchmarks. It also maintained low Expected Calibration Error, showing consistency and reliable confidence estimates.

Conclusion: LSC proves to be a practical solution for ensuring consistency across different answer formats while being efficient and model-agnostic.

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

### [61] [Can Out-of-Distribution Evaluations Uncover Reliance on Shortcuts? A Case Study in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18407)
*Michal Štefánik,Timothee Mickus,Marek Kadlčík,Michal Spiegel,Josef Kuchař*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations for generalization in AI models, especially in QA systems, revealing limitations and proposing improved methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess whether OOD evaluations reliably predict real-world deployment failures of AI models, particularly those caused by shortcuts or spurious features in QA settings.

Method: The authors compare OOD evaluations with documented failure modes in QA models, analyzing the robustness of datasets used for OOD testing and their connection to in-distribution evaluations.

Result: The study finds significant variability in the reliability of OOD datasets for evaluating QA models, with some datasets performing poorly relative to in-distribution evaluations. Shared spurious shortcuts across datasets and disconnected dataset quality were observed.

Conclusion: Commonly-used OOD evaluations have critical limitations in assessing model generalization in QA, necessitating robust methodologies and recommendations to improve evaluation processes.

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

### [62] [How Reliable are LLMs for Reasoning on the Re-ranking task?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18444)
*Nafis Tanveer Islam,Zhiming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the explainability of LLMs in re-ranking tasks and analyzes how different training methods affect their semantic comprehension and provision of textual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need to improve the transparency of LLMs in re-ranking tasks, ensuring reliable reasoning and informed decisions for end users, while handling limited training data challenges.

Method: The authors analyzed various training methods and their impact on LLMs' performance in semantic understanding for re-ranking tasks, using a small dataset from the environment and Earth science domain.

Result: It was found that not all training methods enable accurate semantic understanding, as some prioritize abstract knowledge optimization over explainability and reliability.

Conclusion: The paper identifies the potential for certain training methods to enhance LLMs' textual reasoning, addressing transparency issues and improving re-ranking tasks.

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

### [63] [Integrating gender inclusivity into large language models via instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18466)
*Alina Wróblewska,Bartosz Żuk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses gender bias in Polish language models by fine-tuning them with a gender-inclusive dataset and guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of masculine bias in Polish language models caused by the predominance of masculine grammatical forms in traditional Polish texts.

Method: The authors fine-tuned large multilingual and Polish-specific language models using IPIS, a dataset of gender-inclusive adjustments and provided a system prompt with explicit inclusivity guidelines.

Result: Successfully mitigated masculine bias in Polish language generation by incorporating gender-inclusivity into large language models.

Conclusion: Gender inclusivity can be systematically integrated into language generation, paving the way for fairer and less biased models in gendered languages like Polish.

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

### [64] [Principled Detection of Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Multiple Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18473)
*Jiawei Li,Akshayaa Magesh,Venugopal V. Veeravalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tackles hallucinations in LLMs by treating their detection as a hypothesis testing problem, proposing a new multiple-testing-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but prone to generating incorrect or nonsensical information (hallucinations), necessitating reliable detection methods.

Method: The study uses a hypothesis testing approach, drawing parallels with out-of-distribution detection, and introduces a multiple-testing-inspired framework for hallucination detection.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robustness and effectiveness, validated through extensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Handling hallucinations in LLMs is essential for improving model reliability, and the proposed approach offers a promising solution validated by experimental results.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

### [65] [COMET-poly: Machine Translation Metric Grounded in Other Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18549)
*Maike Züfle,Vilém Zouhar,Tu Anh Dinh,Felipe Maia Polo,Jan Niehues,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new metrics, COMET-polycand and COMET-polyic, for assessing machine translation quality more effectively by using additional information beyond a single translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated machine translation metrics may underperform because they compare translations based only on the source sentence and a single result, ignoring alternative translations or context.

Method: COMET-polycand uses alternative translations to evaluate the quality of the primary translation, while COMET-polyic leverages translations of similar source texts paired with human-labeled quality scores for informed assessment.

Result: COMET-polycand improves metric performance from 0.079 to 0.118 (Kendall's tau-b correlation) by including alternative translations, while COMET-polyic achieves improvements from 0.079 to 0.116 using retrieved examples.

Conclusion: Incorporating additional translations and contextual examples during evaluation leads to better metric performance, suggesting that richer contextual information boosts translation quality assessments.

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

### [66] [The Mind's Eye: A Multi-Faceted Reward Framework for Guiding Visual Metaphor Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18569)
*Girish A. Koushik,Fatemeh Nazarieh,Katherine Birch,Shenbin Qian,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-evaluating visual metaphor generation framework, focusing on aligning metaphors using novel metrics and structured prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generate visually coherent images from metaphorical text input, requiring nuanced understanding of source-target mappings in language.

Method: Proposes two pipelines: a training-free method with a source-target-meaning (S-T-M) decomposition, and a training-based reinforcement learning (RL) method using self-evaluation rewards.

Result: Training-free pipeline outperformed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on evaluation metrics; user studies revealed model preferences vary by metaphor type and aesthetic features.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and lightweight reinforcement learning effectively tackle metaphor alignment challenges with modest computation, although gaps in human preference remain influenced by aesthetics and sampling configurations.

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

### [67] [What do language models model? Transformers, automata, and the format of thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18598)
*Colin Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that large language models (LLMs) model their training data rather than human cognitive capacities, relying on limitations from transformer architecture and citing the concept of shortcut automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether large language models reflect human cognitive abilities or simply mimic their training corpus.

Method: Analyzes the computational invariants of transformer architecture and discusses the shortcut automata framework from prior research.

Result: Highlights the linear processing limitation of transformers and proposes a view of LLMs as machines that utilize language differently compared to humans.

Conclusion: LLMs and humans use and create language differently due to distinct underlying mechanisms, illustrating diverse ways of leveraging 'discourse machines.'

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

*Rumeng Li,Xun Wang,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes NOOV, a neural machine translation system for translating EHR narratives from English to Spanish, emphasizing solutions for unknown words and repetitive phrase issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical tasks require accurate translation of EHR narratives between languages like English and Spanish, which is challenged by insufficient aligned corpora and the presence of unknown words.

Method: NOOV uses a bilingual lexicon learned from existing corpora and incorporates a phrase look-up table extracted from a biomedical resource, allowing it to mitigate translation challenges in NMT.

Result: NOOV enhances the translation of EHR narratives by improving accuracy and fluency while addressing unknown word and word-repeat challenges.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates promise for improving clinical translations, making NOOV potentially valuable for real-world medical applications.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

### [69] [Scaling Laws for Task-Stratified Knowledge in Post-Training Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18609)
*Chenxi Zhou,Pengfei Cao,Jiang Li,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of post-training quantization (PTQ) on large language models (LLMs) by establishing task-stratified scaling laws based on a set of key quantization parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how PTQ affects various LLM knowledge capabilities and to address gaps in previous scaling laws which lack consideration of task-specific and PTQ-specific factors.

Method: An extensive empirical investigation was conducted, focusing on task-stratified scaling laws, where LLM knowledge was categorized into memorization and utilization capabilities. A quantitative framework involving model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size was developed.

Result: Knowledge memorization was found to be more sensitive to changes in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to knowledge utilization, which was more robust against these variations.

Conclusion: PTQ has distinct impacts on memorization versus utilization within LLM knowledge capabilities, enabling the development of better quantization strategies tailored to preserve specific cognitive functions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

*Cong Li,Wenchang Chai,Hejun Wu,Yan Pan,Pengxu Wei,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses deficiencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics by introducing "insights" between reasoning steps to guide thinking more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to the lack of human-like reasoning patterns in their training data, which often omits critical insights and methodologies.

Method: The authors propose a framework called "Thinking Before You Speak" (TBYS), which generates proactive insights to guide reasoning. A pipeline for automatic collection and filtration of in-context examples supports insight generation, reducing human labeling and fine-tuning efforts.

Result: Experiments on complex mathematical tasks demonstrate that TBYS improves reasoning performance compared to other strategies.

Conclusion: Inserting proactive insights effectively bridges reasoning gaps in LLMs, enhancing their competency in tackling challenging reasoning tasks like mathematics without significant manual intervention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

### [71] [Breaking the Trade-Off Between Faithfulness and Expressiveness for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18651)
*Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si,Zheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a method to enhance the faithfulness and expressiveness of grounded responses in LLMs by dynamically integrating external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the difficulty of current LLMs in simultaneously achieving faithfulness (accuracy to external knowledge) and expressiveness in their outputs.

Method: Collaborative Decoding (CoDe) dynamically integrates probabilities generated by LLMs with and without external knowledge, guided by divergence metrics and model confidence. A reranking mechanism minimizes over-reliance on internal parametric knowledge.

Result: The CoDe framework enhances faithfulness without sacrificing expressiveness, demonstrating consistent effectiveness across various LLMs and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: CoDe successfully balances faithfulness and expressiveness, addressing shortcomings of existing grounding methods and proving generalizable across diverse settings.

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

*Haoyu Wang,Guangyan Zhang,Jiale Chen,Jingyu Li,Yuehai Wang,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emotion Omni proposes a novel architecture for speech large language models (LLMs) capable of generating empathetic responses by understanding emotional cues in speech. It introduces a data generation method built around a free TTS framework to create a 200k emotional dialogue dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing user interactions with speech LLMs by enabling them to understand rich emotional and paralinguistic cues for improved empathetic communication.

Method: Developed the Emotion Omni architecture and a data generation pipeline using an open-source TTS framework to construct a labeled 200k emotional dialogue dataset to train the model.

Result: Emotion Omni is capable of effectively comprehending emotional context in user speech and generating empathetic speech-based responses without the need for large-scale training.

Conclusion: Emotion Omni showcases a promising step toward developing efficient and empathetic speech LLMs by leveraging limited resources and improving human-machine emotional engagement.

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper improves Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting by addressing limitations from random/manual example selection via a novel curriculum design strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the instability and suboptimal performance in MCoT prompting caused by random/manual selection of examples, which fail to align with model knowledge and task complexity.

Method: The method frames prompt selection as a curriculum design problem, integrating model-perceived difficulty and intrinsic sample complexity to create balanced and diverse training examples.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show consistent and significant improvements in performance and stability using the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust and systematic approach to enhance multimodal reasoning by leveraging novel difficulty-balanced prompt selection strategies.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

*Songtao Jiang,Yuxi Chen,Sibo Song,Yan Zhang,Yeying Jin,Yang Feng,Jian Wu,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of inconsistency in Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) responses to varied rephrasings of medical questions. The authors propose a novel dataset (RoMed) and a training method (Consistency and Contrastive Learning) to improve model robustness and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VLMs struggle to maintain consistent answers across semantically equivalent question rephrasings, posing risks in medical diagnosis reliability.

Method: The authors constructed RoMed, a dataset with 144k diverse question variations, and introduced Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), combining knowledge-anchored consistency learning and bias-aware contrastive learning.

Result: State-of-the-art models showed drastic performance drops (e.g., 40% decline in Recall) on RoMed compared to original VQA benchmarks. In contrast, CCL achieved SOTA results on multiple benchmarks while boosting answer consistency on RoMed by 50%.

Conclusion: The study highlights robustness gaps in Med-VLMs and demonstrates that targeted dataset design and innovative training paradigms can significantly enhance consistency and reliability in medical visual question answering.

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

*Yanfan Du,Jun Zhang,Bin Wang,Jin Qiu,Lu Huang,Yuan Ge,Xiaoqian Liu,Tong Xiao,Jingbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Attention2Probability, a method for improving speech-to-text systems’ handling of domain-specific terms and neologisms. It achieves higher accuracy and faster performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the difficulty of accurately generating domain-specific terminology and neologisms by speech large language models.

Method: The paper proposes Attention2Probability, which uses cross-attention weights to estimate the presence probabilities of terms. It also employs curriculum learning to enhance retrieval. A novel dataset is introduced to remedy data scarcity.

Result: Attention2Probability outperforms the VectorDB method with recall rates of 92.57% (Chinese) and 86.83% (English) and latency of 8.71ms per query. Using this method improves terminology accuracy in speech-to-text tasks by 6-17%.

Conclusion: Attention2Probability is a lightweight, efficient, and flexible approach that enhances speech-to-text systems’ accuracy in handling domain-specific terms, highlighting current limitations in terminology handling by SLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

*Duy Le,Kent Ziti,Evan Girard-Sun,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) to improve multilingual riddle generation in large language models by enhancing lexical diversity and reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing prompting strategies in large language models, which often produce repetitive or shallow outputs when generating multilingual riddles.

Method: The paper describes the Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) framework, leveraging cosine-based similarity rejection to filter repetitive outputs while enforcing novelty and cross-lingual accuracy.

Result: AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieved notable performance metrics, including Self-BLEU 0.177 and Distinct-2 0.915 in Japanese, outperforming other methods in reducing redundancy and improving lexical diversity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using semantic rejection techniques can enhance creative and culturally sensitive generation in LLMs without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances MGT detection reliability by emphasizing non-expert-friendly explanations, providing practical benefits for trustworthy AI in customer service environments.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that

TL;DR: This paper introduces DIVER, a framework for generating diverse and high-quality ad headlines using large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing methods that prioritize headline quality or CTR, often at the expense of diversity.

Method: DIVER is built with a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline and employs a multi-stage multi-objective optimization framework combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).

Result: Experiments reveal that DIVER improves advertiser value (ADVV) by 4.0% and CTR by 1.4% when deployed on a large-scale platform.

Conclusion: DIVER successfully offers optimized ad headline generation by balancing quality and diversity, benefiting both advertisers and audiences.

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

*Qiao Liang,Ying Shen,Tiantian Chen,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in multimodal conversations (MECTEC) by introducing MECAD, a diverse dataset, and M3HG, a novel model leveraging multimodal heterogeneous graphs. Experiments show improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance MECTEC analysis, particularly hindered by limited datasets and inadequate modeling approaches in current methods.

Method: The authors introduced MECAD, a dataset with diverse scenarios, and M3HG, a model utilizing multimodal heterogeneous graphs to capture emotional and causal contexts and fuse semantic information.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that M3HG notably outperforms existing methods in emotion cause triplet extraction tasks.

Conclusion: MECAD and M3HG significantly enhance the capability to analyze multimodal conversations, providing resources and methodologies to advance research in social media analysis.

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

*Byeongjeong Kim,Jeonghyun Park,Joonho Yang,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChronoRAG is a framework for long-context question answering, optimizing narrative understanding by focusing on temporal order and structured passages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle with narrative texts because their comprehension demands understanding broader contexts and sequential relationships, not just isolated document segments.

Method: ChronoRAG refines scattered information into structured passages and explicitly captures temporal order across narrative texts, enhancing retrieval and generation tasks.

Result: ChronoRAG achieved significant improvements on the NarrativeQA dataset, demonstrating better performance in comprehending complex sequential and factual relationships within narratives.

Conclusion: ChronoRAG effectively addresses narrative text challenges by maintaining temporal flow and structured comprehension, outperforming existing RAG approaches in narrative QA tasks.

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

*Qianyu He,Siyu Yuan,Xuefeng Li,Mingxuan Wang,Jiangjie Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ThinkDial, an open-source framework enabling controllable reasoning in large language models through discrete operational modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of reasoning control in open-source LLMs, which hinders efficient computational effort management.

Method: The method involves embedding reasoning capabilities during supervised fine-tuning and budget-aware reinforcement learning within an end-to-end training pipeline.

Result: The system achieves desired trade-offs between computational reduction and performance, with clear token reduction and minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: ThinkDial successfully implements controllable reasoning modes and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, filling a gap in open-source LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a novel framework to improve grammatical error correction (GEC) performance using large language models (LLMs), achieving state-of-the-art results on Chinese datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder-decoder models for GEC show limitations in harnessing the reasoning capabilities of large language models, as most research relies on supervised fine-tuning methods.

Method: The authors propose a Rule-Based RL framework that leverages reinforcement learning principles to steer LLMs toward improved grammatical correction capabilities.

Result: Experiments on Chinese datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance using the Rule-Based RL framework, with significant improvement in recall compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness and advantages of applying RL techniques to control and optimize LLMs for grammatical error correction tasks, suggesting a promising and reliable paradigm for further advancements in NLP.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to automate the process of detecting and categorizing topics in conversations, reducing manual efforts and facilitating more adaptive user-facing summaries compared to traditional intent detection.

Method: The paper presents Theme Detection as a task combining clustering and theme labeling of dialog utterances, with the added feature of user-controlled granularity, evaluated as part of a public competition at DSTC 12.

Result: An overview of the problem, dataset, evaluation metrics, and participant submissions from the DSTC 12 competition is provided.

Conclusion: Theme Detection enables more flexible, user-adaptive analyses of conversations and the work offers resources for further innovation in this domain.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

TL;DR: LaTeXTrans is a multi-agent system for translating LaTeX documents, ensuring preservation of structure, format, and terminology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating LaTeX-formatted documents with natural language and domain-specific syntax accurately while maintaining semantic integrity and compilability.

Method: LaTeXTrans uses six specialized agents to perform parsing, translating, validating, summarizing, extracting terminology, and generating structured LaTeX content collaboratively.

Result: Experimental results show LaTeXTrans outperforms mainstream machine translation systems in translation accuracy and structural fidelity.

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans provides an effective and practical solution for translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised framework for misinformation detection, integrating semantic relations and propagation dynamics to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of misinformation online poses societal challenges, and existing methods lack efficiency in capturing semantic complexity, social dynamics, and require extensive labeled datasets.

Method: The framework uses Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and a graph contrastive loss (LGCL) generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for zero-shot feature separation, paired with a multi-view graph masked autoencoder to learn propagation features.

Result: Experiments show superior performance in identifying fake vs. real news, even with limited labeled data, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances misinformation detection, offers improved generalizability, and reduces dependence on large labeled datasets through self-supervised learning.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Conclusion: The proposed synthesis framework effectively addresses the data quality challenges and significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges

propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConfTuner, a fine-tuning method for calibrating large language models' confidence expressions by leveraging the tokenized Brier score. ConfTuner aims to improve confidence calibration and generalize across diverse models and tasks without requiring ground-truth estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of overconfidence in large language models, which is critical in high-stakes domains like healthcare, science, and law, where trustworthy uncertainty expressions are crucial.

Method: ConfTuner employs a new loss function called the tokenized Brier score, based on proper scoring rules, to fine-tune models for better calibration without needing ground-truth or proxy confidence scores.

Result: ConfTuner enhances calibration across various reasoning tasks, generalizes to black-box models like GPT-4, and facilitates downstream improvements in self-correction and model cascade strategies.

Conclusion: The development of ConfTuner contributes to building more trustworthy language model systems by improving their calibrated confidence expressions. This method is efficient, versatile, and provides crucial advancements for applications demanding reliable uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current autoprompting methods by providing a more precise and comprehensive approach to prompt optimization.

Method: The method employs evolutionary algorithms with reflective evolution, utilizing short-term and long-term reflection operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance modifications and accumulate knowledge over epochs.

Result: ReflectivePrompt shows a significant performance improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared to EvoPrompt) across 33 datasets for classification and text generation tasks.

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt establishes itself as one of the most effective solutions for autoprompting using evolutionary algorithms, advancing state-of-the-art performance in prompt optimization for LLMs.

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

*Laurie Gale,Sebastian Mateos Nicolajsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA) as a method to enable computing education research (CER) on larger scales using large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many CER researchers lack resources, expertise, or colleagues to conduct rigorous and generalizable studies, limiting advancements in the field.

Method: The paper proposes an LLM-assisted content analysis approach, combining traditional content analysis with large language models, to process large volumes of textual data rigorously and reproducibly.

Result: Through an example computing education dataset, the paper demonstrates how LACA facilitates larger-scale and generalizable research within CER.

Conclusion: LACA has the potential to improve CER by enabling rigorous and scalable research, fostering advancements in both educational practices and research methodologies.

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

### [90] [Affective Polarization across European Parliaments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18916)
*Bojan Evkoski,Igor Mozetič,Nikola Ljubešić,Petra Kralj Novak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses parliamentary speeches from six European countries to identify affective polarization, revealing consistent negativity in interactions across opposing groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the presence of affective polarization in European political discourse.

Method: Automated sentiment analysis of parliamentary speeches using natural language processing techniques.

Result: Consistent affective polarization was identified across six European parliaments, with reciprocity driving hostility.

Conclusion: Affective polarization is a prevalent feature in European politics, facilitated by reciprocal hostility despite varying activity levels among parliamentarians.

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

### [91] [Diverse And Private Synthetic Datasets Generation for RAG evaluation: A multi-agent framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18929)
*Ilias Driouich,Hongliu Cao,Eoin Thomas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent framework to generate synthetic QA datasets specifically for evaluating Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, with focus on privacy preservation and semantic diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of attention in the design and quality of evaluation datasets for RAG systems, which are crucial for assessing their reliability and performance while meeting real-world constraints like privacy.

Method: The method involves a multi-agent framework where agents focus on diversity using clustering techniques, privacy by masking sensitive information, and QA creation of diverse and private datasets for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show the proposed QA datasets outperform baseline methods in semantic diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets.

Conclusion: This work contributes to safer and more reliable RAG system evaluations, balancing performance with privacy and compliance, and sets the stage for further advancements in line with AI regulations.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

*Hung Ming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework that develops an AI-native symbolic language within neural models for intuitive reasoning, compositional representation, and enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of post-hoc explanation methods in AI, aiming for embedded reasoning and improved interpretability within model architectures.

Method: The framework incorporates symbolic language with gated mechanisms and uses training objectives targeting symbol purity and decision sparsity, alongside sequential specialization for competence building.

Result: Experiments show it achieves competitive accuracy while providing transparent reasoning traces, combining interpretability and intuition effectively.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a unified mechanism for neural model interpretability, intuitive reasoning, and symbolic capabilities, enhancing transparency and flexibility.

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DistillPrompt, an advanced autoprompting method leveraging LLMs to enhance prompt generation for text tasks, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve prompt optimization for large language models inspired by the growing significance of prompt engineering in LLM research.

Method: DistillPrompt employs multi-stage integration with distillation, compression, and aggregation techniques to optimize prompts using training data.

Result: Testing showed an average improvement of 20.12% in text classification and generation tasks compared to leading methods like Grips.

Conclusion: DistillPrompt sets a benchmark for non-gradient autoprompting methods by achieving substantial advances in key performance metrics.

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which is gaining popularity due to the rapid development of
prompt engineering driven by extensive research in the field of large language
models (LLMs). This paper presents DistillPrompt -- a novel autoprompting
method based on large language models that employs a multi-stage integration of
task-specific information into prompts using training data. DistillPrompt
utilizes distillation, compression, and aggregation operations to explore the
prompt space more thoroughly. The method was tested on different datasets for
text classification and generation tasks using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 language
model. The results demonstrate a significant average improvement (e.g., 20.12%
across the entire dataset compared to Grips) in key metrics over existing
methods in the field, establishing DistillPrompt as one of the most effective
non-gradient approaches in autoprompting.

*Gueter Josmy Faure,Min-Hung Chen,Jia-Fong Yeh,Ying Cheng,Hung-Ting Su,Yung-Hao Tang,Shang-Hong Lai,Winston H. Hsu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MovieCORE is a new video question answering (VQA) dataset focusing on cognitive understanding of movies through System-2 thinking questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for video question answering only assess surface-level comprehension, failing to challenge deeper cognitive reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces a unique agentic brainstorming technique where multiple large language models generate and refine question-answer pairs, supplemented by cognitive tests and a performance evaluation framework.

Result: A dataset that effectively tests deeper cognitive understanding, along with an enhancement module (ACE) that improves existing model reasoning by up to 25%.

Conclusion: MovieCORE advances the field of AI movie understanding by offering more nuanced assessments and highlighting limitations of current VQA systems, pushing the boundaries of cognitive reasoning in video analysis.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to
the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach,
utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights
into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with
more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content. Our project page,

*Ziyue Li,Yuan Chang,Gaihong Yu,Xiaoqiu Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework to improve decision-making in large language model agents by providing adaptive guidance for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with complex planning due to lack of global guidance and adaptive oversight, leading to failures and deviations.

Method: HiPlan uses a milestone library from expert demonstrations for task decomposition and dynamically adapts trajectory segments during execution for continuous alignment with objectives.

Result: Experiments show HiPlan significantly outperforms existing baselines and validates hierarchical component benefits through ablation studies.

Conclusion: HiPlan effectively enhances planning and decision-making in LLM agents for long-horizon and complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

*Tom Röhr,Soumyadeep Roy,Fares Al Mohamad,Jens-Michalis Papaioannou,Wolfgang Nejdl,Felix Gers,Alexander Löser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a study using the SOAP framework to analyze physician intent in medical dialogues, offering insights and a labeled dataset for benchmarking AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and structure physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues and improve the design of differential diagnosis systems.

Method: Develop a taxonomy of physician intents, annotate doctor-patient dialogues using the SOAP framework, benchmark AI models on the labeled data, and evaluate summarization performance.

Result: Models perform well overall but struggle with SOAP category transitions. Intent filtering significantly improves summarization performance.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to medical dialogue analysis and AI interventions, providing a valuable dataset and insights into dialogue structure and summarization enhancements.

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

### [97] [It's All About In-Context Learning! Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19089)
*Yue Li,Zhixue Zhao,Carolina Scarton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to learn extremely low-resource languages via in-context learning (ICL) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), offering key insights and guidelines for efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in supporting extremely low-resource languages, especially those using rare scripts, and to evaluate methodologies for effectively adapting LLMs.

Method: The study systematically evaluates 20 under-represented languages using three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs, comparing zero-shot ICL, few-shot ICL, and PEFT with and without language alignment signals.

Result: Zero-shot ICL with language alignment proves effective for extremely low-resource languages, while PEFT and few-shot ICL are better suited for relatively better-represented languages.

Conclusion: PEFT is limited for extremely under-represented scripts, but ICL—especially zero-shot with language alignment—is a promising approach for adapting LLMs to low-resource languages. Practical guidelines are provided for practitioners.

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

TL;DR: The study introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance provenance research by enabling natural-language and multilingual searches, tested on the Getty Provenance Index for art ownership history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provenance research is key for verifying authenticity, supporting legal claims, and understanding art's historical context, but is hindered by fragmented multilingual archival data and metadata-dependent search tools.

Method: The authors employed a RAG framework combining semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, enabling searches beyond rigid metadata constraints, and tested it on a sample of 10,000 auction records from the Getty Provenance Index.

Result: The RAG framework demonstrated effectiveness in navigating fragmented archival data and simplifying search processes for art provenance research with scalable potential.

Conclusion: The developed method is a practical, scalable tool for historians and cultural heritage professionals, enabling more efficient and natural-language-based searches in historically sensitive research areas.

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transparent hybrid framework for Quantitative Discourse Analysis (QDA) utilizing custom Python pipelines and methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the methodological transparency and alignment challenges posed by using black-box software like MAXQDA and NVivo in QDA.

Method: Develops a hybrid model combining lexical and semantic techniques through a case study approach. Tools like Python's NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers are used, along with an iterative BERTopic modeling workflow.

Result: Demonstrates enhanced topic coherence and coverage using the proposed techniques, while showcasing the importance of triangulation and researcher control.

Conclusion: The approach promotes code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological triangulation, advancing computational discourse studies.

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary
materials are available via GitHub.

*Zhikai Ding,Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how large vision-language models perceive their knowledge boundaries by evaluating three types of confidence signals. It finds that LVLMs show moderate perception but room for improvement, with probabilistic and consistency-based signals proving more reliable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the issue of hallucination in LVLMs and improve their ability to understand what they know and what they don't, fostering more reliable decision-making.

Method: The paper evaluates probabilistic confidence, answer consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence across multiple LVLMs and VQA datasets, applying adapted calibration methods from LLMs.

Result: Probabilistic and consistency-based confidence signals are more dependable, while verbalized confidence often results in overconfidence. Joint visual-text input lowers accuracy but increases perception.

Conclusion: LVLMs show potential in confidence perception, but improvements are essential. Calibration methods and cross-modal processing hold promise in striking a balance between reliability and accuracy.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SciReas and SciReas-Pro benchmarks for evaluating scientific reasoning in LLMs, and proposes KRUX, a framework for disentangling the roles of reasoning and knowledge in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of widely adopted holistic benchmarks and systematic approaches for disentangling the roles of knowledge and reasoning in scientific tasks.

Method: The authors developed SciReas and SciReas-Pro for diverse and complex reasoning tasks and introduced KRUX to probe reasoning and knowledge roles. They conducted evaluations and lightweight analyses of model performance in scientific reasoning.

Result: Key findings include LLMs struggling to retrieve task-relevant knowledge from model parameters, improvement through external in-context knowledge, and enhanced verbalized reasoning leading to better knowledge surfacing.

Conclusion: SciReas, KRUX, and released resources like SciLit01 provide valuable insights and tools to advance scientific reasoning performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address limitations in synthesizing long-form, multi-speaker speech with high fidelity and efficiency, aiming to produce natural dialogue scenarios.

Method: The authors employ next-token diffusion to generate latent vectors via an autoregressive model, alongside a novel continuous speech tokenizer for improved data compression and efficiency.

Result: VibeVoice achieves 80x data compression compared to Encodec with comparable performance and demonstrates synthesis of up to 90-minute speech with 4 speakers.

Conclusion: The model advances the field by enabling realistic, efficient long-form multi-speaker speech synthesis, outperforming existing approaches in the open-source and proprietary sectors.

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

*Isabel Cachola,Daniel Khashabi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques traditional readability metrics in Plain Language Summarization (PLS), showing their poor correlation with human judgments and suggesting that Language Models (LMs) perform better in evaluating readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the evaluation standards for Plain Language Summarization to ensure accessible summaries truly cater to non-expert audiences.

Method: The authors surveyed existing PLS literature, evaluated 8 readability metrics against human readability judgments, and tested the performance of Language Models on readability measurement.

Result: Language Models outperformed traditional metrics, achieving a higher correlation (Pearson correlation of 0.56) with human judgments and capturing deeper readability measures like background knowledge requirements.

Conclusion: LMs offer superior readability evaluation compared to traditional metrics in PLS, leading to better alignment with non-expert audience needs, and recommendations for improved evaluation practices are provided.

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Interfaces for Language Models (LLMs) to optimize multi-turn and exploratory interactions by allowing LLMs to proactively generate task-specific user interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome efficiency limitations in traditional linear request-response systems during complex and information-rich tasks.

Method: The authors developed a framework that uses structured representations and iterative refinement to generate UIs tailored to user queries. They also implemented a multidimensional assessment framework to compare generative interfaces with chat-based ones.

Result: Generative interfaces outperformed traditional conversational systems, with users preferring them in over 70% of cases during diverse tasks and interactions.

Conclusion: Generative interfaces enhance user experience and efficiency in human-AI interaction, highlighting their potential for future advancements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

### [105] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of underwater 3D object detection without real-world training data. It compares a deep learning approach using synthetic sonar data and a template matching method leveraging object geometry, and benchmarks their performance on real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated sonar data and the challenges of collecting it in underwater environments limit the application of deep learning for underwater object detection.

Method: The paper develops two training-free detection paradigms: (1) a physics-based sonar simulation system generating synthetic data for neural networks, and (2) a model-based template matching system using geometric priors.

Result: Neural networks trained on synthetic data achieved 98% mAP on simulations but dropped to 40% mAP on real data due to domain shift. Template matching maintained 83% mAP on real-world data without any training.

Conclusion: While deep learning struggles with domain shift in underwater scenarios, template matching offers a robust training-free alternative, and this work establishes a benchmark, advancing possibilities for data-scarce underwater applications.

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MobileDenseAttn, a dual-stream fusion model combining MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 to improve brain tumor detection via MRI with high accuracy, efficiency, and visual explanation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI analysis for brain tumor detection is slow and error-prone. Current methods struggle with heterogeneous tumors, inefficiency, lack of interpretability, and limited trustworthiness.

Method: MobileDenseAttn fuses MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201, leveraging feature-level fusion and GradCAM for visual explanations. It uses an augmented dataset and strict 5-fold cross-validation for training.

Result: MobileDenseAttn achieved 99.75% training accuracy, 98.35% testing accuracy, and an F1 score of 0.9835. It showed stability, reduced training time, and improved accuracy compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn is a high-performance, interpretable, efficient model capable of localizing brain tumors, positioning it as a clinically practical tool for real-world use.

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [107] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have trouble connecting internal knowledge with visual inputs, but their failure patterns can be predicted using model state probes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to identify and address a systematic deficiency in multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically their inability to reliably link image representations with internal factual knowledge.

Method: Through controlled experiments, the paper examines VLMs' recall capabilities using textual vs visual references and introduces probes on model internal states to identify unreliable predictions without retraining.

Result: Results show that probes achieve over 92% accuracy in detecting unreliable VLM responses, leading to improved coverage (+7.87%) and reduced error (-0.9%) in visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a significant multimodal grounding issue in VLMs, and suggests actionable recommendations for addressing this deficiency and improving future VLM designs.

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to enhance 3D models from sparse images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address severe radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse images for 3D reconstruction.

Method: The method enriches neural implicit representations with semantic logits optimized alongside signed distance and radiance fields, with a novel regularization based on geometric primitive masks to reduce shape ambiguity.

Result: The approach achieved significant improvements in reducing reconstruction errors, lowering average chamfer distances on the DTU dataset by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. As a plugin for dense reconstruction baselines, errors were reduced by 69% for NeuS and 68% for Neuralangelo.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively tackles radiance and shape ambiguities in sparse image-based 3D reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity results and considerable error reduction.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Illegal landfills are a growing concern globally, and manually identifying them is challenging. The paper introduces the AerialWaste Dataset, consisting of 10,434 aerial images of Lombardy, Italy, to assist in landfill detection. Lightweight deep learning models perform well, achieving up to 92.33% accuracy with an ensemble approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illegal landfills threaten public health and the environment worldwide, and manual detection methods are inefficient, calling for tech-driven approaches like deep learning.

Method: This study utilized the AerialWaste Dataset and trained lightweight deep learning models like Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, and Densenet. An ensemble model was created to maximize the predictive accuracy while minimizing overfitting.

Result: The approach achieved high performance metrics: 92.33% accuracy, 92.67% precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score, and 92.71% specificity in binary classification tasks.

Conclusion: Lightweight models combined with ensemble techniques are effective in detecting illegal landfills using the AerialWaste Dataset, demonstrating strong potential for scalable and impactful environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSU, a framework for multimodal sentiment analysis that systematically integrates structural and semantic information from text, audio, and visual data, achieving superior performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods struggle with neglecting structural dependencies specific to each modality and semantic misalignment, leading to limitations in quality, robustness, and interpretability.

Method: The SSU framework uses modality-specific graphs based on linguistic syntax and text-guided attention mechanisms for audio and visuals. It incorporates a semantic anchor for aligning cross-modal spaces and applies a multiview contrastive learning objective to enhance consistency and discriminability.

Result: SSU achieves state-of-the-art results on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets while reducing computational overhead compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: SSU improves multimodal sentiment analysis by harmonizing structural and semantic dependencies across different modalities, demonstrating high performance, computational efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar is a rapid feed-forward framework for generating pose-invariant 3D Gaussian Splatting models from a single face image in <10ms, achieving high reconstruction quality and identity preservation with novel encoder-decoder architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a fast and robust method to generate 3D face models that support applications in interactive and consumer-level avatar systems.

Method: FastAvatar employs a novel encoder-decoder neural architecture to encode input images into pose-invariant latent embeddings and predict residuals to a pre-trained 3DGS face template's structural and appearance parameters, ensuring fast and robust inference.

Result: FastAvatar outperforms prior methods in reconstruction quality by significant margins, operates 1000x faster than optimization-based methods, and enables real-time identity and attribute edits due to its latent space design.

Conclusion: FastAvatar delivers a novel solution combining speed, quality, and flexibility, paving the way for expanded applications of 3DGS in realistic avatars for interactive systems.

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a mobile biometric system using PolyProtect for secure template protection in humanitarian scenarios, evaluated on face and fingerprint data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to leverage biometric technologies to improve operational efficiency in emergency contexts while safeguarding vulnerable individuals' privacy and security.

Method: A mobile biometric system was developed utilizing PolyProtect for securing face and fingerprint biometrics, assessed using the EdgeFace feature extractor for accuracy and unlinkability.

Result: PolyProtect demonstrated effectiveness and adaptability, meeting security and privacy needs in both face and fingerprint biometrics on real-world humanitarian datasets.

Conclusion: This study highlights PolyProtect’s capability as a robust, modality-independent biometric template protection scheme, presenting promising results for practical deployment in humanitarian scenarios.

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [113] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models are effective but limited in explicit relational reasoning tasks. Augmenting them with relational graphs enhances performance and efficiency, especially in fine-grained tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of vision foundation models in tasks requiring relational reasoning, emphasizing the importance of improving their capacity for explicit relational reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes augmenting vision foundation models with dynamic relational graphs to improve relational understanding and task performance.

Result: Relational graph-enhanced models improve semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and efficiency compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The paper suggests further research on hybrid FM-graph systems, focusing on dynamic graph construction, multi-level reasoning, cross-modal fusion, and relational competence evaluation.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of recognizing illegible license plates, introduces a new LPLC dataset for legibility classification, and proposes classification benchmarks that highlight the difficulty of the task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the core issue of recognizing illegible license plates for ALPR systems while optimizing computational efficiency in pre-processing low-quality images.

Method: A novel dataset (LPLC) was created with 10,210 vehicle images and annotated license plates across various legibility categories. Benchmarks using ViT, ResNet, and YOLO networks were proposed for classification tasks.

Result: Benchmark results show that none of the three baseline models achieved an overall F1 score above 80%, emphasizing the complexity of the problem.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and benchmarks highlight the need for improved methods to address ALPR challenges, offering a valuable resource for future research.

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: CLARIFY introduces a Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering, improving diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have healthcare potential but are limited by diagnostic accuracy and inference costs.

Method: The framework combines a domain-trained image classifier and compressed conversational VLM guided by a knowledge graph-based module.

Result: CLARIFY enhances diagnostic accuracy by 18% over baselines and reduces VRAM and latency by 20% and 5%, respectively.

Conclusion: Specialist-Generalist design is effective for lightweight, accurate, and clinically viable AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a zero-shot anomaly detection framework combining TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to effectively detect anomalies without prior exposure to anomaly examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting context-dependent and unpredictable anomalies in surveillance footage.

Method: The framework integrates a hybrid architecture combining TimeSformer (vision backbone), DPC (temporal forecasting), and CLIP (semantic understanding) trained jointly with InfoNCE and CPC loss. A context-gating mechanism facilitates decision refinement.

Result: The system generalizes to previously unseen anomalies and bridges temporal reasoning with semantic context for improved zero-shot detection.

Conclusion: This work advances zero-shot anomaly detection by effectively merging spatiotemporal and semantic analysis, showing promise in complex surveillance settings.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow introduces a self-supervised framework for estimating full 3D object motions in LiDAR scenes using pseudo-labels derived from radar Doppler measurements, outperforming existing methods and achieving near fully supervised performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the challenge of developing robust perception models for 3D scene flow estimation, given the bottleneck of large-scale manual annotations and limitations of current methods in dynamic and adverse environments.

Method: DoGFlow leverages radar Doppler-based motion pseudo-labels and transfers them to the LiDAR domain through dynamic-aware association and ambiguity-resolved propagation.

Result: On the MAN TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow significantly surpasses existing self-supervised methods and achieves over 90% of the supervised performance with only 10% of labeled data.

Conclusion: DoGFlow advances scalable LiDAR scene flow estimation by relying on self-supervised techniques, reducing the dependency on expensive manual labeling while delivering high performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth

DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised

### [119] [SAT-SKYLINES: 3D Building Generation from Satellite Imagery and Coarse Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18531)
*Zhangyu Jin,Andrew Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SatSkylines, a method for 3D building generation from satellite imagery and coarse priors, overcoming limitations in current methods by leveraging a new transformation modeling approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to reconstruct accurate 3D structures from top-down satellite imagery or fail to work well with simple geometric priors like cuboids.

Method: The authors introduce a model that transforms noisy coarse priors into detailed 3D geometries, supported by a new dataset called Skylines-50K with over 50,000 3D building assets.

Result: The approach effectively generates detailed 3D building models and demonstrates strong generalization abilities in evaluations.

Conclusion: SatSkylines enables accurate and detailed 3D building generation, resolving current issues in data reliance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the problem of detecting critical Spatial Transition Points (STPs) in game environments and proposes a deep-learning pipeline as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated map navigation and level design evaluation by efficiently detecting critical map transition points in complex RPG game environments.

Method: A two-stage deep-learning pipeline: Faster R-CNN for detecting potential STPs and a lightweight MSTP selector for ranking them, with optional retrieval-augmented fusion and parameter-efficient adapters for model robustness.

Result: The proposed pipeline establishes feasibility and baseline metrics for the problem, showing superior performance with full fine-tuning but greater robustness using adapter-only transfer in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: The study defines a novel research problem, provides key insights into efficient model adaptation, and introduces tools to aid future AI-driven navigation and level design innovations.

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model called Wan-S2V for audio-driven character animation, targeting cinematic complexities, showing significant advancements over SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven animation methods are inadequate for film and TV-level demands like nuanced interactions, realistic body motions, and dynamic camera work.

Method: Developed Wan-S2V, an audio-driven model based on Wan, achieving higher fidelity and expressiveness for cinematic contexts.

Result: Wan-S2V consistently outperforms SOTA models such as Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman in expressed benchmarks and exploratory tasks.

Conclusion: Wan-S2V extends audio-driven animation capabilities to film-grade challenges, along with applications in long-form content and lip-sync editing.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

### [122] [Decouple, Reorganize, and Fuse: A Multimodal Framework for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18632)
*Huayi Wang,Haochao Ying,Yuyang Xu,Qibo Qiu,Cheng Zhang,Danny Z. Chen,Ying Sun,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework called Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion (DeReF) for cancer survival analysis, addressing limitations in fixed fusion schemes and enhancing dynamic feature interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of traditional methods in cancer survival analysis that rely on fixed fusion schemes and lack dynamic interaction of features among modalities.

Method: The proposed method, Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion (DeReF), integrates a random feature reorganization strategy between decoupling and dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion modules. Moreover, a regional cross-attention network is used to improve decoupled feature representation.

Result: The framework demonstrated its effectiveness through experiments on both in-house Liver Cancer data and three widely-used TCGA datasets.

Conclusion: DeReF improves the generalization of expert networks and enhances feature interaction, offering a significant advancement in dynamic modality fusion for survival analysis. The code will also be made available for public use.

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

*Chenxuan Miao,Yutong Feng,Jianshu Zeng,Zixiang Gao,Hantang Liu,Yunfeng Yan,Donglian Qi,Xi Chen,Bin Wang,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ROSE, a framework for video object removal that handles objects' side effects (e.g., shadows, reflections) using synthetic data generation and a novel inpainting model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video object removal systems struggle to eliminate object side effects like shadows, reflections, and translucency, due to a lack of paired video data for effective model training.

Method: The authors created a paired dataset using a 3D rendering engine and developed ROSE, a video inpainting model based on a diffusion transformer, coupled with additional supervision based on differential masks to detect side-effect areas.

Result: ROSE demonstrates superior performance in removing both objects and their side effects, as evaluated on a newly introduced benchmark (ROSE-Bench), showing strong generalizability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ROSE effectively addresses the challenge of removing objects and their side effects from videos, outperforming existing methods and expanding the scope of video object erasure systems.

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

*Chunlin Zhong,Qiuxia Hou,Zhangjun Zhou,Shuang Hao,Haonan Lu,Yanhao Zhang,He Tang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces solutions to overcome motion-detail imbalance in video captioning by proposing a new dataset (HMD-270K) and an optimization approach (CSER), resulting in a robust model, OwlCap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning methods struggle with motion-detail imbalance, leading to incomplete and inconsistent captions, which hinder accurate video understanding and generation.

Method: The paper proposes two solutions: a new dataset, HMD-270K, constructed using Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE), and an optimization approach, Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER), based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: OwlCap, the proposed model, achieves significant improvements over baselines with +4.2 Acc on detail-focused VDC and +4.6 F1 on motion-focused DREAM-1K benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses motion-detail imbalance in video captioning, offering a balanced and accurate multi-modal model (OwlCap) and publicly releasing the dataset and model to advance research.

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a clustering-based feature representation learning method to improve the automated detection of Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs) from degraded images, achieving significant improvements across three detection networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of automated detection of OBIs, which are hindered by degradation factors like noise and cracks in rubbing images, thus limiting the effectiveness of conventional detection networks.

Method: The method employs clustering-based representation learning using a prior dataset of Oracle Bones Character (OBC) fonts. It optimizes feature representation through a specialized loss function based on clustering results, which is integrated with the total network loss.

Result: Experiments conducted on two OBIs detection datasets using Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN frameworks showed noticeable performance improvements across all frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach leveraging clustering-based representation learning successfully enhances the detection abilities of existing networks, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling degraded OBIs images for digital archaeology.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

*Xin Tian,Yingtie Lei,Xiujun Zhang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SFormer, a novel underwater image enhancement method utilizing frequency-domain SNR priors and integrating spectral components through a Fourier-based transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater image enhancement suffers from challenges like cross-channel interference and insufficient noise suppression using existing spatial domain SNR priors, necessitating a shift to a more robust frequency-domain approach.

Method: The paper proposes using SNR priors in the frequency domain, decomposing image features into amplitude and phase spectra for precise channel modulation. It introduces the FAST module for spectral interactions and the FAT bottleneck to combine spectral branches. These modules form part of the SFormer framework within a U-shaped architecture.

Result: The proposed SFormer method achieves significant performance improvements, with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and a 0.08 increase in SSIM, effectively restoring underwater image qualities like color, texture, and contrast.

Conclusion: By leveraging frequency domain SNR priors and advanced spectral interaction mechanisms, SFormer demonstrates superior underwater image enhancement capabilities compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

*Dongfang Wang,Jian Yang,Yizhe Zhang,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel hierarchical network for improved heart function estimation via echocardiography video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for echocardiography video segmentation achieve good segmentation but fail to accurately estimate EF.

Method: The authors introduce a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network combining single-frame and multi-frame processing, with a novel Spatio-temporal Cross Scan module.

Result: The method enhances EF estimation by integrating local details and global dynamics, mitigating biases caused by typical imaging noise.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances single-frame and multi-frame analysis, reducing errors and improving EF calculation accuracy.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

*Zhitong Cheng,Yiran Jiang,Yulong Ge,Yufeng Li,Zhongheng Qin,Rongzhi Lin,Jianwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses domain adaptation challenges by introducing FPS, a method leveraging domain-invariant geometric patterns in pretrained models for optimizing decision boundaries without altering feature extractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the persistent issue of domain shift in deep learning systems, which is especially challenging during transitions from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains.

Method: The method involves a framework called Feature-space Planes Searcher (FPS), which optimizes decision boundaries using geometric patterns in pretrained models' feature spaces, while keeping feature encoders unchanged and utilizing offline feature extraction for efficiency.

Result: Evaluations show FPS matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple domains, scales efficiently for large models, and demonstrates versatility across various applications like remote sensing, protein prediction, and earthquake detection.

Conclusion: FPS provides an effective, efficient, and scalable approach to domain adaptation tasks, emphasizing interpretability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An optimized deep learning framework for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) achieves high accuracy (99.65%) with reduced computational features using a hybrid of InceptionV3, LSTM, and a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The critical issues with existing HAR systems, such as high computational cost, redundant features, and poor scalability in real-time scenarios, necessitate the development of a more efficient framework.

Method: A hybrid deep learning framework combining a customized InceptionV3 for spatial descriptors, LSTM for temporal modeling of dependencies, and an ensemble-based genetic algorithm (ADFSA) for feature selection.

Result: Achieves 99.65% recognition accuracy on challenging datasets, reduces feature sets significantly, and ensures faster inference suitable for edge-device deployment.

Conclusion: This framework enables practical, real-time HAR applications on resource-constrained devices while addressing scalability, accuracy, and efficiency in diverse environments.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ColorGS, a framework for reconstructing deformable tissues from endoscopic videos with improved color detailing and deformation modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing subtle color variations and consistent global deformations while reconstructing tissues in endoscopic videos.

Method: ColorGS uses Colored Gaussian Primitives for adaptive color encoding and introduces an Enhanced Deformation Model (EDM) to improve texture richness and deformation accuracy.

Result: ColorGS achieves state-of-the-art results, with a PSNR of 39.85 and a superior SSIM of 97.25%, demonstrating improvement over prior methods.

Conclusion: ColorGS advances surgical scene reconstruction through enhanced fidelity and computational efficiency, facilitating better intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces a variant of flooding regularization targeting class-level imbalances in datasets, achieving improved minority class recognition and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of poor recognition performance for minority classes in neural networks trained on imbalanced datasets.

Method: A novel class-wise flooding regularization assigns class-specific thresholds, curbing overfitting for majority classes while promoting learning for minority classes.

Result: Validation on imbalanced image classification datasets showed improved minority class performance and enhanced overall generalization compared to standard techniques.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of class-wise flooding regularization, ensuring balanced learning across class types for improved model generalization.

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM) to dynamically assess sample difficulty, enabling effective integration of Curriculum Learning (CL) with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for improved generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of overfitting in neural networks trained with empirical risk minimization, which results in poor generalization. Existing methods like Curriculum Learning and Sharpness-Aware Minimization tackle these issues independently, but their combination faces challenges in flat regions, where evaluating sample difficulty becomes problematic.

Method: The authors propose ADM, a novel difficulty measure that leverages the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples to address the shortcomings of CL and SAM in flat regions. They integrate ADM into a CL-based training framework with SAM, dynamically adjusting difficulty assessment during training.

Result: Experimental evaluations on image classification, fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization tasks show that the proposed method outperforms existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training techniques, preserving the strengths of both CL and SAM.

Conclusion: The proposed ADM-based method successfully combines Curriculum Learning and Sharpness-Aware Minimization, addressing the challenges of sample difficulty evaluation in flat regions and enhancing model generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

### [133] [Are All Marine Species Created Equal? Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729)
*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates challenges in underwater object detection, with a focus on why certain marine species, like scallops, are harder to detect. By studying both localization and classification, the authors identify intrinsic obstacles and suggest strategies to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the factors contributing to performance disparities in detecting underwater objects, particularly challenges beyond data quantity, and to propose systematic improvements for detecting under-performing marine species.

Method: The authors manipulate the DUO dataset, use YOLO11 and TIDE for localization analysis, and conduct classification experiments to explore the scallop class's under-detection issues.

Result: Analysis reveals that foreground-background discrimination is the main challenge in localization, and precision gaps persist in classification despite data balancing, pointing to intrinsic feature-based obstacles rather than just data scarcity.

Conclusion: Recommendations include using imbalanced datasets for precision-focused objectives, and balanced datasets for recall-focused objectives. Addressing under-performing species requires algorithmic improvements, especially in localization modules.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

*Christian Löwens,Thorben Funke,Jingchao Xie,Alexandru Paul Condurache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PseudoMapTrainer, a method to train online mapping models without relying on expensive high-definition ground-truth maps. It uses pseudo-labels derived from unlabeled sensor data and a semi-supervised approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-definition ground-truth maps used for training online mapping models are expensive to generate and geographically limited, which hinders generalization.

Method: PseudoMapTrainer employs multi-camera data reconstructed via Gaussian splatting and a pre-trained 2D segmentation model for pseudo-label creation. It incorporates a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss function to deal with masked pseudo-labels.

Result: The approach successfully trains online mapping models without relying on ground-truth maps, enabling semi-supervised pre-training using crowdsourced data.

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer demonstrates that online mapping models can be trained effectively without ground-truth maps, using pseudo-labels derived from unlabeled sensor data. This opens pathways for scalable, cost-effective large-scale mapping.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

*Feiwei Qin,Shichao Lu,Junhao Hou,Changmiao Wang,Meie Fang,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drawing2CAD converts 2D vector engineering drawings into parametric CAD models using a sequence-to-sequence learning approach, effectively addressing a gap in CAD generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to fill the gap in automating the generation of parametric CAD models from 2D engineering drawings, which is an underexplored but essential component of industrial workflows.

Method: The authors propose Drawing2CAD, which features a vector primitive representation, a dual-decoder transformer architecture, and a soft target distribution loss function. They also create a dataset named CAD-VGDrawing for training and evaluation.

Result: Drawing2CAD demonstrates effective transformation of 2D vector drawings into parametric CAD models, maintaining geometric precision and design intent.

Conclusion: This work bridges CAD generation techniques with traditional engineering workflows, offering a precise and effective framework for converting 2D engineering drawings into parametric CAD models.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

### [136] [Interpretable Decision-Making for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18898)
*Mona Mirzaie,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve interpretability and performance of AI-driven control for autonomous vehicles, focusing on sparse feature maps and safer driving models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for trustworthy AI in autonomous vehicles and challenges in interpreting AI decisions in complex urban environments.

Method: Introducing loss functions to create sparse and localized feature maps for enhancing interpretability of neural network predictions in autonomous driving.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated improved interpretability alongside reduced infractions and high route completion rates on CARLA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method ensures high-performance and safe autonomous driving while maintaining greater interpretability, outperforming top CARLA Leaderboard models.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

### [137] [Improving Noise Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Router-Gated Cross-Modal Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18734)
*DongHoon Lim,YoungChae Kim,Dong-Hyun Kim,Da-Hee Yang,Joon-Hyuk Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for audio-visual speech recognition that adapts to noisy environments by reweighting audio and visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of robust speech recognition in noisy environments where existing systems struggle to effectively balance between audio and visual modalities.

Method: The method involves using a router-gated mechanism that integrates audio-visual feature fusion and dynamically adjusts reliance on modalities based on audio quality. A gated cross-attention mechanism in decoder layers pivots to visual cues when audio signals are unreliable.

Result: The proposed approach reduces the word error rate by 16.51-42.67% relative to AV-HuBERT, as shown by experiments on the LRS3 dataset. Ablation studies validate the significance of the router and gating mechanism.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves robustness in audio-visual speech recognition under noisy conditions by adaptively leveraging reliable features from both modalities.

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

### [138] [VibES: Induced Vibration for Persistent Event-Based Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19094)
*Vincenzo Polizzi,Stephen Yang,Quentin Clark,Jonathan Kelly,Igor Gilitschenski,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a simple, lightweight solution for event cameras to generate events in static or low-motion scenes using vibrational motion induced by a rotating unbalanced mass, paired with a motion-compensation process to produce clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras struggle to generate data under static or low-motion conditions, which limits their application in computer vision tasks.

Method: The authors used a rotating unbalanced mass to induce vibrations in the event camera and developed a motion-compensation pipeline to produce clean event data after removing the injected motion.

Result: A hardware prototype was created and validated on real-world datasets, demonstrating improved image reconstruction and edge detection compared to event cameras without motion stimulation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively resolves the limitation of event cameras in static or low-motion conditions, enhancing their utility in computer vision tasks without the need for complex hardware.

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

### [139] [Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753)
*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether modern generative vision-language models (VLMs) can effectively perform HOI detection and compares them to specialized HOI methods. It identifies and addresses the misalignment in current evaluation protocols by introducing a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if general-purpose generative VLMs can solve human-object interaction (HOI) detection tasks effectively and how they compare to specialized methods, given the advancements in VLMs.

Method: The paper introduces a novel benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a multiple-answer multiple-choice task, reducing ambiguity by only including ground-truth positive options and carefully curated negatives.

Result: The new evaluation protocol avoids penalizing VLMs and HOI-specific methods for plausible predictions in ambiguous cases, allowing for a fairer and more insightful comparison of techniques.

Conclusion: The introduced benchmark is the first to align well with generative VLMs and specialized HOI methods, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of progress in HOI understanding.

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

### [140] [Beyond the Textual: Generating Coherent Visual Options for MCQs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18772)
*Wanqiang Wang,Longzhu He,Wei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS) to generate educational multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with visual options effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MCQs in education often lack visual options, and creating high-quality distractors manually is costly and not scalable.

Method: The authors propose CmOS, an approach combining Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating semantically relevant visual answer options and distractors, supported by a discrimination module to optimize content selection.

Result: CmOS outperforms existing methods in discriminating content, generating MCQs, and producing visual options across subjects and education levels.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates its potential to enhance learning through efficient generation of visually rich and intellectually engaging educational resources.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized for low-power devices to extract physiological signals like heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation from facial videos, while prioritizing efficient performance under constraints such as scalability and interoperability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges of scalability, interoperability, and performance in real-time physiological monitoring on resource-constrained low-power devices.

Method: The system uses the Face2PPG pipeline for rPPG signal extraction from facial video streams, employs a multithreaded architecture for handling concurrent tasks, integrates adaptive feedback via a user interface, and adopts a hybrid programming model leveraging Functional Reactive Programming and the Actor Model for efficient task management.

Result: The system ensures continuous operation at 30 fps, delivers robust performance in real-time, minimizes computational overhead, and provides tools for adaptive monitoring through HTTP and RESTful API access.

Conclusion: The work resolves critical challenges in biosignal monitoring for healthcare and human-computer interaction, offering a scalable and performant solution optimized for low-power embedded systems.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves AI-driven waste detection by benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection models, fine-tuning them to establish new baselines, and introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework for scalable annotation pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in AI-powered waste detection caused by limited datasets and outdated object detection methods to enhance sustainable recycling practices.

Method: The paper benchmarks Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models, fine-tunes transformer-based detectors, and proposes a semi-supervised learning framework with ensemble-based soft pseudo-labeling.

Result: The fine-tuned models achieve a new baseline of 51.6 mAP, and the pseudo-annotations from the semi-supervised framework surpass fully supervised training performance.

Conclusion: This study establishes strong baselines, introduces an effective annotation pipeline, and significantly advances AI capabilities in real-world waste sorting scenarios.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method to create embeddings for impression tags based on relationships with font shapes, outperforming standard models like BERT and CLIP in impression-based font tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Font styles convey specific impressions, and leveraging these shape-impression relationships allows improved understanding and utilization of impression tags for tasks like font generation.

Method: The technique involves constructing a graph with impression tags as nodes and co-occurrence relationships as edges. Spectral embedding is then applied to generate impression vectors for each tag.

Result: Compared to BERT and CLIP, the proposed method demonstrated superior performance in metrics related to impression-guided font generation.

Conclusion: The novel embedding approach effectively represents impressions of fonts, proving its utility in tasks such as font generation and retrieval by leveraging shape-impression relationships.

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc Rußwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper showcases the advantage of fine-tuning pre-trained remote sensing foundation models for improving tree species classification in National Forest Inventories (NFIs), surpassing traditional methods by up to 10% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining National Forest Inventories (NFIs) is labor-intensive, and there is a need for scalable, efficient methods to improve tree species classification using remote sensing and machine learning techniques.

Method: The authors utilized fine-tuning of publicly available pre-trained remote sensing foundation models with few annotated datasets. Data was sourced from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5, and SRTM satellites, with processing performed via Google Earth Engine.

Result: Fine-tuning remote sensing foundation models led to a significant 10% improvement in tree species classification accuracy in the Netherlands over traditional Random Forest-based methods relying on hand-crafted features.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based approaches using pre-trained models and openly available satellite data are highly effective for NFI classification tasks. These methods outperform traditional approaches and can complement existing forest inventory processes with enhanced accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

including severe class imbalance, high morphological variability, and domain
heterogeneity across different tumor types, species, and scanners. Through
strategic preprocessing with 60% center cropping and mixed precision training,

### [146] [Boosting Micro-Expression Analysis via Prior-Guided Video-Level Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18834)
*Zizheng Guo,Bochao Zou,Yinuo Jia,Xiangyu Li,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel video-level regression method for analyzing micro-expressions (MEs), addressing prior limitations in temporal dynamics capture and windowing. The method also includes shared parameter optimization for spotting and recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for micro-expression analysis struggle with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which fail to fully capture the temporal complexity of these fleeting expressions. Interval decoding methods also rely on predefined intervals, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose a prior-guided interval selection strategy to optimize the spotting of onset, apex, and offset phases of MEs. Additionally, they use a synergistic optimization framework, sharing parameters between spotting and recognition tasks, except for classification heads.

Result: The proposed method delivers state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, achieving an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV.

Conclusion: This method addresses previous limitations, improves the analysis of MEs through better temporal and task integration, and showcases its effectiveness through experimental results.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantitative image-based framework to objectively assess microsurgical anastomoses, avoiding biases of subjective evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, assessment methods for microsurgical anastomosis rely on subjective judgment, leading to potential biases and inefficiencies in evaluating competence.

Method: The framework leverages image-processing techniques combined with geometric error modeling and scoring mechanisms to assess microsurgical outcomes.

Result: The proposed geometric metrics closely match expert raters' scoring when evaluating specific surgical errors.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the reliability and efficiency of microsurgical training and assessment, offering objective and consistent evaluation standards.

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

### [148] [Harnessing Meta-Learning for Controllable Full-Frame Video Stabilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18859)
*Muhammad Kashif Ali,Eun Woo Im,Dongjin Kim,Tae Hyun Kim,Vivek Gupta,Haonan Luo,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for video stabilization that improves pixel-level synthesis models by incorporating rapid adaptation at test time. The approach utilizes low-level visual cues and targets high-jerk segments for enhanced stability and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level synthesis for video stabilization faces challenges due to diverse motion profiles and visual content in videos, making generalization with fixed parameters difficult.

Method: The method involves rapid adaptation of models during inference using low-level visual cues, coupled with a jerk localization module and targeted adaptation focused on high-jerk areas.

Result: The approach enhances video stabilization in both stability and visual quality, outperforms SOTA methods, and works across diverse real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The methodology significantly improves modern full-frame synthesis models and aligns with classical control mechanisms, showing versatility and promising outcomes in video stabilization and related applications.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

### [149] [Toward Robust Medical Fairness: Debiased Dual-Modal Alignment via Text-Guided Attribute-Disentangled Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18886)
*Yuexuan Xia,Benteng Ma,Jiang He,Zhiyong Wang,Qi Dou,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFairVL is a framework to address fairness in medical diagnosis by jointly debiasing and aligning vision-language model representations using multi-modal prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance fairness in medical diagnosis across demographic groups, especially under distribution shifts caused by imaging equipment and clinical practice variations.

Method: The proposed DualFairVL framework employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle sensitive and target attributes, aligns representations across modalities using orthogonal text anchors and cross-attention mechanisms, and applies a hypernetwork for instance-aware visual prompts.

Result: DualFairVL outperforms existing methods in fairness and accuracy on eight medical imaging datasets under both in- and out-of-distribution conditions, requiring only 3.6M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: DualFairVL provides a robust and fair solution for cross-modal alignment in medical diagnosis, promising improved equitable healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

### [150] [DQEN: Dual Query Enhancement Network for DETR-based HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18896)
*Zhehao Li,Chong Wang,Yi Chen,Yinghao Lu,Jiangbo Qian,Jiong Wang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to improve HOI detection by enhancing object and interaction queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in DETR-based HOI detection where randomly initialized queries lead to vague representations and reduced model effectiveness.

Method: The proposed DQEN enhances object queries using object-aware encoder features and introduces an Interaction Semantic Fusion module to refine interaction queries. Additionally, an Auxiliary Prediction Unit is implemented to strengthen interaction feature representation.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Enhancing object and interaction queries via DQEN improves HOI detection capabilities, demonstrating effectiveness and readiness for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

TL;DR: EVENTA Grand Challenge introduces a benchmark for contextual and semantic event-level multimodal understanding using the OpenEvents V1 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimedia tasks neglect real-world contextual and semantic dimensions, prompting the need for an event-level understanding framework.

Method: EVENTA integrates contextual, temporal, and semantic data for event-oriented analysis of images across two tracks: Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.

Result: 45 teams participated, showcasing innovative solutions evaluated under fair conditions, with top three teams presenting at ACM Multimedia 2025.

Conclusion: EVENTA lays groundwork for multimedia AI emphasizing context-aware, narrative-driven approaches, enabling applications in media, cultural archiving, and journalism.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

*Amartaivan Sanjjamts,Morita Hiroshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to distinguish group and single pedestrians using trajectory data and a Transformer-based model, laying groundwork for analyzing their spatial and behavioral patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand differences in spatial utilization and emergent behavioral patterns between group and single pedestrians, offering deeper insights for crowd dynamics research.

Method: Segmenting pedestrian trajectories into time bins, using a Transformer-based pair classification model, followed by sequence-based filtering to classify pedestrians as group or single.

Result: Development of metrics for spatial utilization (e.g., convex hull area, spatial density) and behavioral interactions (velocity changes, trajectory deviation), alongside encounter typologies such as single-to-group.

Conclusion: The study successfully initiates a scalable classification pipeline and dataset structuring, paving the way for future quantitative analysis and its applications in pedestrian simulation and space design.

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

*Matteo Contini,Victor Illien,Sylvain Poulain,Serge Bernard,Julien Barde,Sylvain Bonhommeau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cost-effective framework for mapping coral reefs using aerial imagery combined with underwater data, addressing challenges in resolution and annotation scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coral reef monitoring at large spatial scales is crucial for health assessment and conservation but is hindered by challenges like low-resolution drone imagery and the high cost of manual annotation for segmentation.

Method: The approach uses a multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that transfers ecological data from underwater imagery to aerial data, employing classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation, and self-distillation.

Result: The framework successfully enables large-scale segmentation of coral morphotypes from drone imagery while requiring minimal manual annotation; it is versatile for adapting to new classes.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable, economical methodology for high-resolution coral reef monitoring, integrating drone imagery, weakly supervised deep learning, and multi-scale sensing.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative AI model capable of producing accurate, style-controlled maps by integrating vector data, making map-making more accessible and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map-making via GIS involves high complexity, domain expertise, and inefficiencies in repetitive tasks, necessitating innovative solutions for automation and democratization.

Method: The researchers used vector data as spatial guidance within image diffusion models and textual prompts to control map styles, resulting in style-accurate maps generated by this novel GenAI system.

Result: The developed AI model effectively produced accurate maps across controlled styles and was well-received in usability and fidelity tests by professional cartographers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrated the promise of generative AI for democratizing map-making, aiding non-experts and professionals alike while outlining new roles for cartographers and potential enhancements for AI-assisted workflows.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a vision model that is both efficient and achieves state-of-the-art performance without relying on complex enhancements like data augmentation or positional embeddings.

Method: The model employs token mixing, sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers for processing input data efficiently.

Result: Achieved significant improvement in CIFAR100 top-1 and top-5 validation accuracy benchmarks (46.29% and 76.31%, respectively) while maintaining high efficiency compared to SDPA transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture provides a stable and efficient alternative to traditional methods in vision tasks with fixed context lengths and is made publicly accessible for evaluation and use.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,

while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available

*Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Jiahe Tian,Yiming Luo,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces USO, a unified framework merging style-driven and subject-driven generation, delivering state-of-the-art results in both style similarity and subject fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to unify the antagonistic objectives in style-driven and subject-driven generative tasks, leveraging their shared focus on disentangling and re-composing content and style.

Method: USO utilizes a large-scale triplet dataset and a disentangled learning scheme combining style-alignment and content-style disentanglement objectives. It also employs a style reward-learning paradigm called SRL. Additionally, a benchmark (USO-Bench) is proposed for joint evaluation of style and subject fidelity.

Result: USO achieves state-of-the-art performance according to extensive experiments, optimizing both subject consistency and style similarity compared to other open-source models.

Conclusion: The proposed USO framework effectively bridges the gap between style and subject optimization in generative tasks, providing significant advancements in disentangled learning and robust evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses privacy concerns in visual localization (VL) tasks using NeRF-based methods by proposing a new privacy assessment protocol and a privacy-preserving alternative called ppNeSF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF-based methods for visual localization provide high-quality view synthesis but encode sensitive scene details, raising privacy issues when utilized in cloud-based applications.

Method: The paper introduces a protocol to evaluate the privacy risks of NeRF-based visual localization. Additionally, it proposes ppNeSF, a modified NeRF trained with segmentation supervision instead of RGB data, which ensures coarse representations that obscure sensitive details while preserving necessary 3D discriminative information.

Result: The proposed ppNeSF model achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual localization while effectively addressing privacy concerns by obscuring identifiable scene details.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that ppNeSF can mitigate privacy risks in NeRF-based visual localization without compromising accuracy, offering a viable solution for secure cloud-based localization services.

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

TL;DR: The paper proposes incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) for handling multi-page documents efficiently, substituting memory-intensive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of memory-hungry Document VQA methods, such as concatenation of all pages or reliance on very large vision-language models.

Method: The study systematically evaluates different retrieval variants (text-based and visual-based retrieval) for incorporating RAG into Document VQA, benchmarking them against datasets using ablations to identify effective components.

Result: The text-centric retrieval approach improves baseline performance by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual retrieval achieves a +5.0 ANLS improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of retrieval and reranking.

Conclusion: Careful evidence selection using retrieval components boosts accuracy in Document VQA across various benchmarks, confirming the practical utility of RAG over traditional methods.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical need for understanding demographic biases in Vision Language Models as they are increasingly applied to real-world contexts.

Method: Introduced the GRAS benchmark and GRAS Bias Score, benchmarked five VLMs, and evaluated biases using multi-formulated Visual Question Answering (VQA).

Result: Findings revealed significant demographic biases in VLMs, with the least biased model scoring only 2 out of 100 on the GRAS Bias Score.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes the necessity for improved methods to uncover and mitigate biases in VLMs, and offers a public resource for advancing bias evaluation in this domain.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

*Siyuan You,Guozheng Xu,Pengwei Zhou,Qiwen Jin,Jian Yao,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoofSeg, a new edge-aware transformer-based network for end-to-end roof plane segmentation from LiDAR point clouds, addressing existing issues in deep learning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance roof plane segmentation for building model reconstruction because current approaches suffer from non-optimal results, low feature discriminability at edges, and insufficient use of geometric constraints in network training.

Method: The authors developed RoofSeg, which employs a transformer encoder-decoder framework with learnable plane queries and introduces an Edge-Aware Mask Module (EAMM) to enhance edge segmentation accuracy. They also propose an adaptive mask loss weighting strategy and a novel plane geometric loss.

Result: The proposed RoofSeg model achieves improved accuracy in segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds, particularly near the edges.

Conclusion: RoofSeg is a significant improvement for roof plane segmentation, offering a truly end-to-end approach with better edge accuracy and enhanced geometric constraint considerations through module and loss innovations.

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroDetect-Net (MDN) employs fluorescence microscopy and deep learning to detect microplastics in blood samples with 92% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastic pollution is pervasive across air, water, soil, and organisms, posing significant health hazards like liver infections and gut flora imbalance.

Method: MDN combines fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red dye staining, convolutional neural networks, and segmentation for microplastic detection in blood samples.

Result: MDN achieved an accuracy of 92%, Intersection over Union of 87.4%, F1 score of 92.1%, Precision of 90.6%, and Recall of 93.7% on Nile Red-stained blood images.

Conclusion: MDN demonstrates robust performance in detecting microplastics, offering a promising technique for application to human blood samples in further studies.

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of

*Yi Pan,Yujia Zhang,Michael Kampffmeyer,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProPy, a novel model adapting CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), achieves state-of-the-art performance using a multi-granularity Prompt Pyramid structure and dynamic interaction mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of retrieving videos relevant to query-specific segments in PRVR, leveraging underexplored CLIP vision-language models.

Method: ProPy employs a Prompt Pyramid structure for multi-level semantic granularity and an Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism for dynamic semantic event interaction.

Result: ProPy significantly outperforms previous models in PRVR across three public datasets, achieving SOTA results.

Conclusion: ProPy demonstrates that systematic architectural adaptations of CLIP enhance PRVR capabilities, providing a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

### [163] [GReAT: leveraging geometric artery data to improve wall shear stress assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19030)
*Julian Suk,Jolanda J. Wentzel,Patryk Rygiel,Joost Daemen,Daniel Rueckert,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of self-supervised learning on geometric artery models to improve the segmentation of coronary artery regions based on wall shear stress, using limited clinical trial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of data scarcity in training machine learning models for assessing hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear stress from medical images.

Method: Utilize self-supervised learning on a dataset of 8449 3D blood vessel geometric models, leveraging heat kernel signatures to learn shape representations.

Result: Learned geometric representations significantly enhance the segmentation of coronary arteries into low, mid, and high wall shear stress regions, using limited training data.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning on large geometric datasets can effectively overcome data scarcity and improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical need for adaptable, efficient, and high-performing surface defect detection methods in manufacturing industries, overcoming limitations of existing approaches constrained to specific supervision scenarios.

Method: The authors developed SuperSimpleNet, incorporating synthetic anomaly generation, enhanced classification head, and improved learning procedures to handle unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed supervised, and fully supervised settings.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet bridges the gap between academic research and industrial defect detection applications with its unified approach to diverse supervision scenarios, exceptional speed, and reliability.

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

TL;DR: This paper introduces a bilevel optimization method to develop task-specific binary illumination patterns for single-pixel imaging, significantly improving reconstruction performance, especially with limited sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve object reconstruction in single-pixel imaging, particularly for applications such as fluorescence microscopy, by optimizing structured light patterns.

Method: Developed a bilevel optimization approach using Straight-Through Estimator and Total Deep Variation regularizer to learn binary illumination patterns for single-pixel imaging.

Result: Validated the method on the CytoImageNet microscopy dataset, showing better reconstruction performance than baseline methods, especially in undersampled scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization method enables enhanced task-specific illumination patterns, achieving superior reconstruction performance in single-pixel imaging applications.

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a

patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using

*Rafael Sterzinger,Tingyu Lin,Robert Sablatnig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of text line segmentation in historical documents using few-shot learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the issue of insufficient annotated datasets for text line segmentation in historical document analysis while reducing the labor and cost associated with traditional annotation approaches.

Method: They use a lightweight UNet++ model coupled with a connectivity-aware loss function that penalizes structural errors. The training is done on patches from only three annotated manuscript pages.

Result: The methodology achieves a 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union on the U-DIADS-TL dataset. It also delivers F-Measure scores comparable to the DIVA-HisDB competition winner while using significantly less annotated data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that small architectures and topology-aware loss functions can be highly data-efficient and accurate, setting a new benchmark for text line segmentation in scenarios with minimal training data.

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

### [167] [Dual Enhancement on 3D Vision-Language Perception for Monocular 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19165)
*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of monocular 3D visual grounding and proposes methods to improve 3D text comprehension and geometry feature enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard text embeddings for monocular 3D visual grounding lack sensitivity to measurement units, negatively affecting 3D comprehension and performance.

Method: The authors introduce 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE) for mapping unit diversity and a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module for geometrical consistency.

Result: The approach achieves a significant 11.94% accuracy improvement in the challenging 'Far' scenario on the Mono3DRefer dataset, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Enhancing text-based 3D perception with unit sensitivity and geometrical consistency improves performance and provides a robust method for monocular 3D visual grounding.

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE) to enhance vision transformers by addressing 2D positional encoding limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers face challenges due to their one-dimensional positional embeddings disrupting the two-dimensional spatial structure of images.

Method: Proposed a mathematically principled WEF-PE approach using elliptic functions to encode spatial distances naturally, enabling better translation invariance and spatial relationship encoding.

Result: Achieved 63.78% accuracy in CIFAR-100 (ViT-Tiny), 93.28% accuracy in CIFAR-100 fine-tuning (ViT-Base), and showed consistent improvements across VTAB-1k tasks.

Conclusion: WEF-PE enhances geometric inductive bias and spatial reasoning in vision transformers, outperforming conventional methods in both theoretical and experimental evaluations.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

### [170] [FastMesh:Efficient Artistic Mesh Generation via Component Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework for efficient artistic mesh generation that reduces token redundancy, accelerates the process by over 8x, and improves mesh quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current mesh generation approaches where redundant token sequences caused by vertex reuse lead to prolonged generation processes.

Method: The framework separates vertex and face generation to minimize redundancy. It uses an autoregressive model for vertices and a bidirectional transformer for mesh completion. Additionally, a fidelity enhancer and post-processing are introduced for better vertex arrangement and undesirable edge removal.

Result: The proposed method reduces token sequences to about 23% of previous compact tokenizers, accelerates mesh generation by over 8x, and improves the quality of generated meshes.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances the efficiency and quality of mesh generation, demonstrating potential for faster and more effective artistic mesh creation.

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module for scalable and interpretable image attribute manipulation using text-to-image diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the scalability and flexibility of attribute manipulation in T2I diffusion models while reducing parameter redundancy.

Method: Decomposes the text embedding space into sparse, meaningful attribute directions to create a general-purpose slider for continuous attribute control.

Result: Improved accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, supports zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes, and combines multiple attributes effectively.

Conclusion: The All-in-One Slider system broadens practical applicability, enabling extended attribute manipulation for creative and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

*Julian Ost,Andrea Ramazzina,Amogh Joshi,Maximilian Bömer,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to generate large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry and causal view synthesis, overcoming limitations of neural reconstruction methods and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural reconstruction methods are limited by static environments and restricted diversity, while diffusion models struggle with geometry grounding and causality in generating realistic driving data.

Method: The method combines generation of proxy geometry and environmental representation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors, enabling prompt-guided geometry generation and texture conditioning on map layouts.

Result: The approach achieves high controllability and produces realistic, geometrically consistent 3D driving scenes with complex textures and structures.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully bridges the gap between scene reconstruction and generative models, offering a powerful tool for robot learning and large-scale scene generation.

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OmniHuman-1.5, a model designed to generate semantically expressive character animations beyond mere physical resemblance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video avatar models lack a deeper understanding of context, emotion, and intent, focusing only on physical likeness.

Method: The paper proposes the use of Multimodal Large Language Models for semantic textual guidance and a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a Pseudo Last Frame design.

Result: The model achieves superior performance across metrics like lip-sync accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness, and semantic consistency with textual prompts. It also handles complex scenarios including multi-person and non-human subjects.

Conclusion: OmniHuman-1.5 bridges the gap in character animation by delivering semantically coherent and expressive motions driven by multimodal conditions.

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: The paper presents VFTrack, an automated real-time tracking framework for studying dynamic growth in CNTs via SEM imaging, addressing limitations in manual and static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the lack of continuous dynamic growth analysis of CNTs due to experimental challenges in nanoscale motion measurement and shortcomings of existing ex situ and in situ techniques.

Method: The authors developed VFTrack, which combines handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers to track CNT particles in SEM image sequences. They identified optimal configurations using manually annotated trajectories.

Result: The study found the ALIKED detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination for particle tracking, achieving an F1-score of 0.78 and an α-score of 0.89.

Conclusion: VFTrack provides a systematic and automated way to analyze the dynamic growth of CNTs, facilitating real-time optimization of synthesis and bridging gaps between experimental observations and models.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Motivation: Current video segmentation approaches are fragmented, with separate models handling prompted and unprompted segmentation tasks. A unified framework is needed to efficiently address this issue.

Method: AUSM treats video segmentation as sequential mask prediction and uses state-space models to maintain a fixed-size spatial state, enabling scalability to arbitrary video lengths. All components support parallel training across frames for faster training.

Result: AUSM achieves better performance than prior methods on benchmarks (e.g., DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS, MOSE, YouTube-VIS, OVIS) and offers up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.

Conclusion: AUSM successfully unifies segmentation tasks, improves efficiency, and sets new performance benchmarks in streaming video segmentation.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

*Beiqi Chen,Shuai Shao,Haitang Feng,Jianhuang Lai,Jianlou Si,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style4D-Bench is a benchmark suite for evaluating 4D stylization, featuring protocols, baseline models, and datasets for dynamic high-resolution scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To standardize evaluation criteria and accelerate progress in the emerging field of 4D stylization.

Method: Style4D-Bench offers evaluation protocols, a curated dataset, and a baseline model (Style4D) built on 4D Gaussian Splatting supplemented by MLP-based appearance control and coherence learning for consistent stylization.

Result: Experiments showcase Style4D's ability to achieve state-of-the-art results in 4D stylization with detailed stylistic outputs and consistent multi-view rendering.

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench sets a foundation for advancing 4D stylization research and serves as a valuable resource for standardizing benchmarks in dynamic scene rendering.

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D enables posing 3D assets through language control without training, using image generation and pose optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in vision and language models, manipulating 3D assets based on textual instructions remains a challenging and underexplored area.

Method: The authors decompose the problem into two steps: (1) modify an image generator to create target images via text instructions, using a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) for structural consistency and (2) align the 3D mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimization process using keypoints for correspondence.

Result: Articulate3D demonstrates strong performance on a variety of 3D assets and text prompts, maintaining mesh identity while enabling accurate pose manipulations. Quantitative evaluations and user studies show it outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Articulate3D provides an effective training-free approach to pose 3D objects using language control and offers a superior alternative to existing methods, evidenced by quantitative results and user preferences.

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

*Lin Li,Zehuan Huang,Haoran Feng,Gengxiong Zhuang,Rui Chen,Chunchao Guo,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoxHammer introduces a training-free method for precise 3D editing in latent space, outperforming traditional approaches in preserving unaltered regions and generating coherent edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D editing methods struggle to preserve unedited regions and maintain coherence during reconstruction. Solutions for these issues are crucial for the gaming industry and robotics.

Method: VoxHammer employs a 3D latent space approach by predicting inversion trajectories, caching key-value tokens, and ensuring consistent reconstruction during the denoising phase.

Result: VoxHammer achieves better 3D consistency and overall quality compared to current methods, validated experimentally with a new benchmark, Edit3D-Bench.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates VoxHammer's potential for precise 3D editing, aiding in the creation of high-quality edited data, and advancing structured generative 3D applications.

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

TL;DR: The paper discusses using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable large language model-powered agents to effectively interact with diverse research cyberinfrastructures, showcasing its application through case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing adoption of LLM-powered agents in scientific workflows requires solutions to overcome barriers posed by heterogeneous APIs and security models in research CI.

Method: Implementing thin MCP servers over existing mature services like Globus Transfer, Compute, and Search; combining domain-specific tools for more seamless research workflows.

Result: Demonstrated applications of MCP in various domains such as computational chemistry and bioinformatics. Case studies reveal its potential to unify CI operations and invoke capabilities.

Conclusion: Employing MCP can enhance discoverability, invocation, and composition of research tools, though challenges remain in agent evaluation and establishing trust.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used to plan and
execute scientific workflows, yet most research cyberinfrastructure (CI)
exposes heterogeneous APIs and implements security models that present barriers
for use by agents. We report on our experience using the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) as a unifying interface that makes research capabilities discoverable,
invokable, and composable. Our approach is pragmatic: we implement thin MCP
servers over mature services, including Globus Transfer, Compute, and Search;
status APIs exposed by computing facilities; Octopus event fabric; and
domain-specific tools such as Garden and Galaxy. We use case studies in
computational chemistry, bioinformatics, quantum chemistry, and filesystem
monitoring to illustrate how this MCP-oriented architecture can be used in
practice. We distill lessons learned and outline open challenges in evaluation
and trust for agent-led science.

*Ehsan Yousefzadeh-Asl-Miandoab,Reza Karimzadeh,Bulat Ibragimov,Florina M. Ciorba,Pınar Tözün*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CARMA is a system designed to tackle GPU underutilization in deep learning (DL) task collocation while addressing memory crashes and task slowdowns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studies show that GPUs are underutilized in enterprise-scale DL training due to inefficiencies in task collocation, creating a need for improvement in resource utilization.

Method: CARMA combines GPUMemNet, an ML-based GPU memory estimator, with collocation policies and recovery methods to minimize memory crashes and interference during task execution.

Result: CARMA improves GPU utilization by 39.3%, cuts execution time by ~26.7%, and reduces GPU energy consumption by ~14.2%, according to evaluations based on real-world DL task traces.

Conclusion: By intelligently managing GPU resources, CARMA effectively increases system efficiency, robustness, and energy savings, addressing critical challenges in DL training infrastructure.

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs --
the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often
significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to
address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for
the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU
due to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to
robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy
efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource
management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses
GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training
tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies
that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA
introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our
evaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows
that CARMA increases the GPU utilization over time by 39.3\%, decreases the
end-to-end execution time by $\sim$26.7\%, and reduces the GPU energy use by
$\sim$14.2\%.

*Abhijeet Saraha,Yuanbo Li,Chris Porter,Santosh Pande*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes GPU partitioning and scheduling schemes to optimize performance and energy efficiency for diverse workloads, achieving significant throughput and energy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of leveraging concurrency and managing chip partitioning constraints in modern GPUs for various workloads.

Method: Developed dynamic memory estimation, partition fusion/fission, and process restart techniques for scheduling and partitioning GPUs.

Result: Achieved throughput improvements of up to 6.20x and energy improvements of up to 5.93x for general workloads; for ML workloads on an A100 GPU, improvements were 1.59x and 1.12x respectively; LLM workloads saw throughput gains up to 1.43x with 1.11x energy savings.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively improve both performance and energy efficiency across diverse workloads by addressing GPU concurrency and partitioning challenges.

Abstract: Modern GPUs such as the Ampere series (A30, A100) as well as the Hopper
series (H100, H200) offer performance as well as security isolation features.
They also support a good amount of concurrency, but taking advantage of it can
be quite challenging due to the complex constraints on partitioning the chip.
  In this work, we develop partitioning and scheduling schemes for a variety of
workloads, ranging from scientific to modern ML workloads, including LLMs. We
develop several schemes involving dynamic memory estimation, partition fusion
and partition fission. We also support process restart to recover from
out-of-memory errors for workloads and early restart as an optimization. This
approach yields up to 6.20x throughput and 5.93x energy improvements for
general workloads; and we see 1.59x and 1.12x improvement to throughput and
energy, respectively, for ML workloads on an A100 GPU. We leverage this
technique on LLM workloads and show good improvements, including up to 1.43x
throughput improvement and 1.11x energy savings.

*Zhiqiang Xie,Ziyi Xu,Mark Zhao,Yuwei An,Vikram Sharma Mailthody,Scott Mahlke,Michael Garland,Christos Kozyrakis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Strata addresses inefficiencies in caching for long-context LLMs by introducing GPU-assisted I/O and smarter scheduling, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the performance and memory bottlenecks faced by LLMs with expanding context windows, especially in production systems using hierarchical caching.

Method: Strata introduces GPU-assisted I/O to reduce KV cache fragmentation and cache-aware scheduling to optimize latency. It balances compute tasks with I/O overheads to avoid loading delays.

Result: Strata shows up to 5x improvement in TTFT compared to existing solutions like vLLM + LMCache and a 3.75x speedup over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM for long-context benchmarks.

Conclusion: Strata successfully improves efficiency in long-context LLM serving, enhancing both performance and usability without sacrificing short-context operations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with expanding context windows face significant
performance hurdles. While caching key-value (KV) states is critical for
avoiding redundant computation, the storage footprint of long-context caches
quickly exceeds GPU memory capacity, forcing production systems to adopt
hierarchical caching across memory hierarchies. However, transferring large
cached contexts back to the GPU introduces severe performance bottlenecks:
fragmented I/O from paged layouts prevents full bandwidth utilization, and
existing schedulers fail to account for cache-loading delays, leaving systems
loading-bound rather than compute-bound. We present Strata, a hierarchical
context caching framework designed for efficient long context LLM serving.
Strata introduces GPU-assisted I/O to combat KV cache fragmentation, decoupling
GPU and CPU memory layouts and employs cache-aware request scheduling to
balance compute with I/O latency and overlapping unavoidable stalls with
complementary tasks. Built on SGLang and deployed in production, Strata
achieves up to 5x lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) compared to vLLM + LMCache
and 3.75x speedup over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on long-context benchmarks, without
degrading short-context performance.

### [183] [Examining MPI and its Extensions for Asynchronous Multithreaded Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18667)
*Jiakun Yan,Marc Snir,Yanfei Guo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two MPI extensions, VCI and Continuation, in the context of the AMT runtime HPX, highlighting performance improvements but emphasizing the need for further intra-VCI threading efficiency enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of HPC systems and the growing demand for asynchronous multithreaded communication, especially for AMT systems, require new solutions beyond the original MPI specification.

Method: This research uses an MPI-level microbenchmark derived from HPX’s communication mechanism to measure potential performance of MPI extensions and integrates these extensions with HPX to evaluate their real-world effectiveness.

Result: The study finds that the extensions can improve performance over standard MPI but face limitations such as the continuation proposal restricting maximum multithreaded message rates and the ineffectiveness of one-VCI-per-thread mode in practical systems.

Conclusion: For scalable multithreaded communication using MPI extensions, better intra-VCI threading efficiency is crucial, as current designs do not fully realize the potential of these new extensions.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of HPC architectures and the growing adoption of
irregular scientific algorithms demand efficient support for asynchronous,
multithreaded communication. This need is especially pronounced with
Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems. This communication pattern was not a
consideration during the design of the original MPI specification. The MPI
community has recently introduced several extensions to address these evolving
requirements. This work evaluates two such extensions, the Virtual
Communication Interface (VCI) and the Continuation extensions, in the context
of an established AMT runtime HPX. We begin by using an MPI-level
microbenchmark, modeled from HPX's low-level communication mechanism, to
measure the peak performance potential of these extensions. We then integrate
them into HPX to evaluate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our
results show that while these extensions can enhance performance compared to
standard MPI, areas for improvement remain. The current continuation proposal
limits the maximum multithreaded message rate achievable in the multi-VCI
setting. Furthermore, the recommended one-VCI-per-thread mode proves
ineffective in real-world systems due to the attentiveness problem. These
findings underscore the importance of improving intra-VCI threading efficiency
to achieve scalable multithreaded communication and fully realize the benefits
of recent MPI extensions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses latency challenges in LLM decoding by introducing high-speed communication primitives and an execution framework called ClusterFusion, which improves operator fusion and reduces reliance on off-chip memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address high latency issues in LLM decoding caused by fragmented execution and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for data exchange.

Method: They propose ClusterReduce and ClusterGather communication primitives designed for high-speed on-chip data exchange and reduction, alongside a framework called ClusterFusion that expands operator fusion through joint scheduling of communication and computation tasks.

Result: ClusterFusion demonstrates improved performance, achieving an average 1.61x reduction in end-to-end latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: The integration of structured communication primitives and expanded operator fusion enhances LLM inference efficiency, offering significant latency improvements in modern GPUs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to
fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for
data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for
fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While
modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory
and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data
movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip
communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two
cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which
abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data
exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing
intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building
on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that
schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope
by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output
Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that
ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on
average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations. The

TL;DR: The paper presents SIREN, a framework for software identification in HPC systems, offering improved observability and insights through fuzzy hashing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiency in traditional software identification methods in HPC systems, which rely on unreliable user-provided names.

Method: SIREN leverages process metadata, environment details, and fuzzy hashing of executables to enable software recognition, preserving privacy and integrity.

Result: SIREN's deployment on LUMI demonstrated its ability to identify repeated executions of known applications and unknown software using similarity-based approaches.

Conclusion: SIREN enhances system optimization and security by providing critical insights, underscoring its potential for wide application in HPC workload analysis.

Abstract: HPC systems use monitoring and operational data analytics to ensure
efficiency, performance, and orderly operations. Application-specific insights
are crucial for analyzing the increasing complexity and diversity of HPC
workloads, particularly through the identification of unknown software and
recognition of repeated executions, which facilitate system optimization and
security improvements. However, traditional identification methods using job or
file names are unreliable for arbitrary user-provided names (a.out). Fuzzy
hashing of executables detects similarities despite changes in executable
version or compilation approach while preserving privacy and file integrity,
overcoming these limitations. We introduce SIREN, a process-level data
collection framework for software identification and recognition. SIREN
improves observability in HPC by enabling analysis of process metadata,
environment information, and executable fuzzy hashes. Findings from a first
opt-in deployment campaign on LUMI show SIREN's ability to provide insights
into software usage, recognition of repeated executions of known applications,
and similarity-based identification of unknown applications.

Motivation: Limitations of traditional supercritical flame simulations due to restricted computational scales hinder advances in modeling combustion systems.

Method: Optimizes DeepFlame software for parallel computing, computational efficiency, and I/O performance, incorporating deep neural networks.

Result: Successfully performs simulations with up to 618 and 154 billion cells at high precision, demonstrating significant computational scalability.

Conclusion: Establishes high-fidelity supercritical flame modeling as crucial for designing next-generation rocket propulsion systems and ultra-high energy density applications.

Abstract: For decades, supercritical flame simulations incorporating detailed chemistry
and real-fluid transport have been limited to millions of cells, constraining
the resolved spatial and temporal scales of the physical system. We optimize
the supercritical flame simulation software DeepFlame -- which incorporates
deep neural networks while retaining the real-fluid mechanical and chemical
accuracy -- from three perspectives: parallel computing, computational
efficiency, and I/O performance. Our highly optimized DeepFlame achieves
supercritical liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/\ce{CH4}) turbulent combustion
simulation of up to 618 and 154 billion cells with unprecedented
time-to-solution, attaining 439/1186 and 187/316 PFlop/s (32.3\%/21.8\% and
37.4\%/31.8\% of the peak) in FP32/mixed-FP16 precision on Sunway (98,304
nodes) and Fugaku (73,728 nodes) supercomputers, respectively. This
computational capability surpasses existing capacities by three orders of
magnitude, enabling the first practical simulation of rocket engine combustion
with >100 LOX/\ce{CH4} injectors. This breakthrough establishes high-fidelity
supercritical flame modeling as a critical design tool for next-generation
rocket propulsion and ultra-high energy density systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in federated fine-tuning of MoE-based LLMs, including high computational demands and resource limitations of participants.

Method: FLUX utilizes quantization-based local profiling, adaptive layer-aware expert merging, and dynamic expert role assignment to optimize resource use and improve accuracy.

Result: Experiments show FLUX achieves up to 4.75X speedup in time-to-accuracy compared to existing methods using benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FLUX provides a practical solution to federated fine-tuning of MoE-based LLMs by balancing resource consumption and accuracy, setting a benchmark for efficiency in constrained environments.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models
(LLMs) is challenging due to their massive computational requirements and the
resource constraints of participants. Existing working attempts to fill this
gap through model quantization, computation offloading, or expert pruning.
However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system
assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In
this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning
of MoE-based LLMs across participants with constrained computing resources
(e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX
introduces three key innovations: (1) quantization-based local profiling to
estimate expert activation with minimal overhead, (2) adaptive layer-aware
expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and
(3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy
to balance tuning and non-tuning experts. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-MoE
and DeepSeek-MoE with multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLUX
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 4.75X speedup in
time-to-accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nanoscale transistors require advanced quantum mechanical modeling to capture strong electron-electron interactions due to ultra-small device dimensions.

Method: The study develops QuaTrEx, incorporating a spatial domain decomposition scheme into the NEGF+GW framework to handle large-scale nanoscale device geometries.

Result: QuaTrEx efficiently models up to 84,480 atoms, achieving over 80% weak scaling efficiency on Alps and Frontier supercomputers and delivering exascale performance.

Conclusion: QuaTrEx marks a significant step forward in computational modeling for state-of-the-art nanoscale electronic devices like NRFETs by enabling scalable and accurate simulations.

Abstract: Designing nanoscale electronic devices such as the currently manufactured
nanoribbon field-effect transistors (NRFETs) requires advanced modeling tools
capturing all relevant quantum mechanical effects. State-of-the-art approaches
combine the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and density
functional theory (DFT). However, as device dimensions do not exceed a few
nanometers anymore, electrons are confined in ultra-small volumes, giving rise
to strong electron-electron interactions. To account for these critical
effects, DFT+NEGF solvers should be extended with the GW approximation, which
massively increases their computational intensity. Here, we present the first
implementation of the NEGF+GW scheme capable of handling NRFET geometries with
dimensions comparable to experiments. This package, called QuaTrEx, makes use
of a novel spatial domain decomposition scheme, can treat devices made of up to
84,480 atoms, scales very well on the Alps and Frontier supercomputers (>80%
weak scaling efficiency), and sustains an exascale FP64 performance on 42,240
atoms (1.15 Eflop/s).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training curriculum for LLMs based on depth of thought (DoT), defined as the discrete steps in a reasoning trace, and demonstrates its effectiveness for reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and interpretable difficulty signal for curriculum learning that aligns with reasoning tasks for LLMs.

Method: Define difficulty as depth of thought (DoT), operationalize it using teacher model reasoning traces, and train models with a shallow-to-deep DoT-ordered curriculum.

Result: The paper hypothesizes and demonstrates that DoT correlates with conventional difficulty, outperforms other curriculum designs, and exhibits robustness across models.

Conclusion: Adopting a DoT-based curriculum offers a cognitively grounded and interpretable approach to reasoning-based training for LLMs, with considerations for validation and potential challenges addressed.

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

*Anastasis Kratsios,Dennis Zvigelsky,Bradd Hart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a method to systematically transform circuits into neural networks, proving that neural networks can emulate any reasoning task when perfectly trained.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to quantify the reasoning capabilities of neural networks by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation.

Method: The paper proposes a meta-algorithm that converts any circuit into a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations by systematically replacing gates with canonical ReLU MLP emulators.

Result: The constructed neural networks emulate circuits exactly without approximation, proving that no reasoning task is beyond the reach of neural networks. The parametric complexity of the neural networks scales with the complexity of the circuit being emulated.

Conclusion: Neural networks can precisely emulate circuits, verifying their ability to perform reasoning tasks and offering applications like algorithm emulation and enhanced universal function approximation.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

*Rahmat K. Adesunkanmi,Alexander W. Brandt,Masoud Deylami,Gustavo A. Giraldo Echeverri,Hamidreza Karbasian,Adel Alaeddini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-modal machine learning framework to predict maritime leeway object drift trajectories, integrating environmental data, Navier-Stokes simulation, and advanced attention-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately forecasting maritime leeway object drift, essential for search and rescue operations, requires innovative solutions due to complex environmental variables and dependencies.

Method: A multi-modal machine learning framework was developed, combining Sentence Transformer embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence LSTM and Transformer models. Inputs include experimentally collected data (physical and environmental), simulated Navier-Stokes drag/lift coefficients, and time series-based modeling.

Result: The framework was tested across varying prediction horizons (1 to 10 seconds) and showed strong generalization across different objects, achieving similar or better performance compared to physics-based and traditional machine learning models.

Conclusion: Multi-modal machine learning models not only match traditional approaches in accuracy but also enhance long-term forecasting capabilities in dynamic maritime conditions.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

*Mateus A. Fernandes,Michael M. Furlanetti,Eduardo Gildin,Marcio A. Sampaio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning approach for forecasting petroleum reservoir production parameters using limited data, aiming to optimize oil recovery while addressing challenges like concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in forecasting production and predicting rock-fluid behaviors in petroleum reservoirs, aiming to improve reservoir management with data-driven solutions.

Method: The study employs supervised machine learning methods, focusing on regressions and Neural Networks, tested first on synthetic data and later on real-world Brazilian pre-salt cases.

Result: The developed methodology offers a reliable predictor capable of reproducing reservoir dynamics, handling operational restrictions, and providing rapid responses useful for reservoir management.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a practical and efficient machine learning-based methodology for reservoir prediction and management, enhancing oil recovery through informed decisions and anticipatory actions.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an active learning-based anomaly detection framework for APTs using similarity search and Attention-Based Autoencoders to enhance detection accuracy and robustness with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APTs are hard to detect due to their stealthy nature and the heavily imbalanced detection datasets.

Method: The method employs an Attention-Based Autoencoder combined with feature-space similarity measures to iteratively improve detection through active learning.

Result: The experiments show significant improvements in model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and label efficiency, with the choice of similarity metric playing a critical role.

Conclusion: The approach is effective in improving APT detection and offers practical insights for designing active learning systems in cyber defense.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

*Md Sabbir Ahmed,Nova Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops a fast and minimalistic system that uses app usage data from the past 7 days to detect depression in students, achieving 82.4% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing systems for detecting depression require long-term data collection, making them less effective for early identification, which is crucial for intervention.

Method: The study developed a rapid tool to collect app usage data from the past 7 days. Using data from 100 students in Bangladesh, it employed machine learning models with diverse feature selection approaches to identify depression.

Result: The light gradient boosting model achieved 82.4% accuracy in detecting depression using app usage data collected in 1 second. A parsimonious stacking model with fewer features showed balanced accuracy of 77.9%.

Conclusion: The proposed system, being fast and minimalistic, is suitable for low-resource settings and can help in early detection of depression, particularly among students in underdeveloped and developing regions.

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning model designed to study the interaction between brain structure variations and genetics in disorders. It outperforms existing methods and offers interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional imaging-genetics methods, which are restricted to simple models or lack interpretability, and to better understand brain-genetic interactions in neurological disorders.

Method: NeuroPathX employs an explainable deep learning framework with cross-attention mechanisms to integrate brain MRI data and genetic pathways. It incorporates sparsity and pathway similarity losses to improve interpretation and robustness.

Result: NeuroPathX demonstrated superior performance over baseline methods in studies on autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease and identified biologically relevant associations.

Conclusion: NeuroPathX can improve our understanding of the brain-genetic interplay in neurological disorders due to its accuracy, interpretability, and biological relevance.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

*Alireza Roustazadeh,Behzad Ghanbarian,Frank Male,Mohammad B. Shadmand,Vahid Taslimitehrani,Larry W. Lake*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study applies machine learning, specifically the XGBoost classification algorithm, to estimate the oil recovery factor based on readily available features in reservoir development, achieving moderate accuracy depending on the database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately determining the recovery factor (RF) in petroleum engineering is critical before exploitation and exploration, but early-stage reservoir data is often incomplete. The paper seeks to address this gap using machine learning.

Method: The study employs the XGBoost classification algorithm with ten-fold cross-validation to estimate RF based on features and analyzes model accuracy using metrics like accuracy, neighborhood accuracy, and macro F1 score.

Result: The XGBoost algorithm achieved RF classification accuracies of 0.49 on training datasets, 0.34 on testing datasets, and 0.2 using unseen independent databases, showing dependence on the initial training dataset's quality.

Conclusion: XGBoost can reasonably estimate RF but is highly dependent on the quality of the training dataset. Key features influencing RF estimation are reserves, reservoir area, and thickness.

Abstract: In petroleum engineering, it is essential to determine the ultimate recovery
factor, RF, particularly before exploitation and exploration. However,
accurately estimating requires data that is not necessarily available or
measured at early stages of reservoir development. We, therefore, applied
machine learning (ML), using readily available features, to estimate oil RF for
ten classes defined in this study. To construct the ML models, we applied the
XGBoost classification algorithm. Classification was chosen because recovery
factor is bounded from 0 to 1, much like probability. Three databases were
merged, leaving us with four different combinations to first train and test the
ML models and then further evaluate them using an independent database
including unseen data. The cross-validation method with ten folds was applied
on the training datasets to assess the effectiveness of the models. To evaluate
the accuracy and reliability of the models, the accuracy, neighborhood
accuracy, and macro averaged f1 score were determined. Overall, results showed
that the XGBoost classification algorithm could estimate the RF class with
reasonable accuracies as high as 0.49 in the training datasets, 0.34 in the
testing datasets and 0.2 in the independent databases used. We found that the
reliability of the XGBoost model depended on the data in the training dataset
meaning that the ML models were database dependent. The feature importance
analysis and the SHAP approach showed that the most important features were
reserves and reservoir area and thickness.

*Wuxinlin Cheng,Yupeng Cao,Jinwen Wu,Koduvayur Subbalakshmi,Tian Han,Zhuo Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel robustness evaluation framework for transformer-based NLP models called SALMAN, employing a unique measure, Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD), without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing concern around the robustness of large-scale pretrained language models (LLMs) under input perturbations, especially given existing methods rely heavily on sample-specific and laborious adversarial designs.

Method: The proposed method, SALMAN, evaluates model stability locally at the sample level using DMD, which measures input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. It does so without altering model parameters or using complex perturbation strategies.

Result: The framework demonstrated significant improvements in attack efficiency and robust training, showcasing its utility in improving model reliability.

Conclusion: The SALMAN framework is a practical, model-agnostic solution to improve the robustness of transformer-based language models without introducing parameter-level modifications or complex adversarial schemes.

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Motivation: The motivation is to enable nonparametric and data-driven estimation of complex vector fields' temporal and spatial dynamics while maintaining their structure.

Method: The authors leverage OV-RKHS and kernel-based Koopman operator methods, deriving representer theorems, Sobolev-type bounds, and spectral convergence guarantees.

Result: The framework demonstrated supports reduced-order modeling and long-term prediction of high-dimensional nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretically supported tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in spatio-temporal machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of
vector valued functions by combining operator valued reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (OV-RKHS) with kernel based Koopman operator methods. The approach
enables nonparametric and data driven estimation of complex time evolving
vector fields while preserving both spatial and temporal structure. We
establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive
Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide
spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations.
This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term
prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically
grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in

### [199] [Federated Learning with Heterogeneous and Private Label Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18774)
*Adam Breitholtz,Edvin Listo Zec,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the challenges of federated learning with heterogeneous and private client label sets, proposing adaptations to mitigate performance losses due to reduced label sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning often assumes homogeneous and publicly shared label sets among clients, which is impractical in scenarios requiring privacy and diverse label distributions. Addressing label heterogeneity and privacy is essential for real-world applications.

Method: The paper adapts classical classifier combination methods to FL, introduces private label set constraints, employs centralized tuning for representational alignment, and explores performance comparisons between public and private label settings.

Result: Experiments show significant performance loss when clients have fewer labels, but centralized tuning mitigates this at the cost of variance. Adapted FL methods achieve similar accuracy in private settings as standard methods in public ones.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptations enable federated learning clients to maintain better privacy with minimal compromise on model accuracy, highlighting their practical viability.

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPE, a position encoding method using complex embeddings, which enhances transformer performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current position encoding in transformers is effective but lacks the ability to robustly model dependencies between elements across different positions.

Method: CoPE utilizes complex-valued positional encoding with real parts for semantic content and imaginary parts for positional data, combined with phase-aware attention in the initial layer.

Result: CoPE outperforms existing positional encoding methods on the GLUE benchmark with lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: CoPE offers a superior, computationally efficient approach for position encoding in transformers.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the distribution of preference data affects Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), identifying that the quality of chosen responses significantly impacts performance while rejected responses are less critical.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand which characteristics of preference data are most important for the performance of DPO, especially given its increasing use for aligning large language models with human preferences.

Method: Both theoretical and empirical studies were conducted, including analyzing the optimal response distribution under DPO and performing extensive experiments across various tasks to evaluate their hypotheses.

Result: The study reveals that improving the quality of chosen responses enhances DPO performance more effectively than focusing on rejected responses. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of response contrastiveness and explores how mixing on-policy data impacts results.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for creating high-quality preference datasets for LLM alignment, showcasing that prioritizing chosen response quality is vital and interpreting the mechanisms behind effective strategies in DPO.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

*Shervin Khalafi,Ignacio Hounie,Dongsheng Ding,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified constrained optimization framework for improving diffusion models by aligning them with rewards or composing multiple models, addressing trade-offs and ensuring desired properties in generated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for enhancing diffusion models struggle to balance multiple rewards or combine models without compromising desired properties, necessitating a robust framework.

Method: The authors introduce a constrained optimization framework with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to combine alignment and composition in diffusion models while enforcing constraints.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved alignment and composition in image generation, meeting constraints better than equally-weighted approaches, as validated empirically.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances diffusion models, ensuring the generation of samples that satisfy desired constraints and combining strengths of multiple models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

TL;DR: ProtoEHR is an interpretable framework leveraging hierarchical prototype learning to optimize predictions using electronic healthcare records (EHRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies often focus on isolated components of EHRs, which limits both predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Method: ProtoEHR employs large language models to form a medical knowledge graph and a hierarchical representation learning framework, modeling relationships between medical codes, visits, and patients with prototype-level representations.

Result: Experiments using two public datasets on five clinical tasks confirmed ProtoEHR's superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability relative to existing baselines.

Conclusion: ProtoEHR demonstrates its potential as a tool to enhance prediction accuracy and provide interpretable insights across multiple levels of EHR data, contributing to effective healthcare predictions.

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

*Weilin Cai,Le Qin,Shwai He,Junwei Cui,Ang Li,Jiayi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DualSparse-MoE, an optimized inference system for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to achieve efficiency and minimal accuracy loss by leveraging dual sparsity at tensor and neuron levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture faces efficiency challenges due to massive computational scales and unpredictable activation patterns despite being promising for Large Language Models (LLMs). The paper aims to improve efficiency while ensuring accuracy.

Method: The authors employ post-training expert partitioning to enhance sparsity at tensor and neuron levels, followed by dynamic computation dropping and static reconstruction. They also account for load imbalance during parallel computation.

Result: Experimental results show significant computational speedups, such as a 25% computation drop rate reducing MoE module speedup by 1.41x with only a minimal accuracy loss of 0.08%-0.5%.

Conclusion: DualSparse-MoE effectively balances computation efficiency and accuracy for MoE models, paving the way for better scalable deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

*Heng Lin,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) expands LLM capabilities by breaking the ceiling of pure-text models, enabling superior problem-solving strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a principled theory explaining why integrating tools with Large Language Models improves their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Formal proof demonstrating expanded capabilities with TIR, introduction of Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO) algorithm, and experiments using a Python interpreter as the external tool.

Result: TIR models outperform pure-text counterparts on mathematical benchmarks, showing improved reasoning in both computational and abstract problems, with better tool usage behavior enhanced by ASPO.

Conclusion: Provides a foundational explanation for the effectiveness of TIR, highlighting its ability to expand problem-solving strategies and improve model reasoning capabilities on multiple metrics.

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study uses Federated Learning (FL) and machine learning (ML) to predict at-risk distance learning students while ensuring data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the high dropout rate in distance education and the need for proactive identification of at-risk students while respecting data privacy constraints.

Method: The study uses ML models, including Logistic Regression and Deep Neural Networks, trained on students' early academic and digital engagement data within a Federated Learning framework.

Result: The federated model achieves a strong ROC AUC score of about 85%, effectively predicting at-risk students.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that Federated Learning offers a scalable and privacy-preserving method for academic institutions to implement early-warning systems for at-risk students.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

### [207] [History Rhymes: Accelerating LLM Reinforcement Learning with RhymeRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18588)
*Jingkai He,Tianjian Li,Erhu Feng,Dong Du,Qian Liu,Tao Liu,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RhymeRL, an RL system for LLMs that improves GPU utilization and accelerates training through speculative rollout generation and smarter scheduling strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL methodologies face significant GPU underutilization due to prolonged rollout stages and uneven workload distribution.

Method: RhymeRL introduces two techniques: HistoSpec for speculative decoding and HistoPipe for workload balancing, leveraging historical rollout similarities.

Result: RhymeRL achieves a 2.6x performance improvement compared to alternative RL approaches while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: RhymeRL demonstrates scalability and efficiency in real-world environments, addressing key bottlenecks in RL training for LLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

*Yang Li,Hanjie Wang,Yuanzheng Li,Jiazheng Li,Zhaoyang Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wind power data faces issues like missing values and privacy concerns. The paper proposes ZTFed-MAS2S framework combining zero-trust federated learning and a multi-head attention-based model for secure and accurate imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to securely address missing wind power data caused by sensor faults and unstable transmission, while ensuring privacy-preserving collaboration in privacy-sensitive industrial environments.

Method: ZTFed-MAS2S framework integrates multi-head attention sequence-to-sequence imputation, zero-trust federated learning, differential privacy, zero-knowledge proofs, dynamic trust-aware aggregation, and communication compression techniques.

Result: The framework exhibits superior federated learning performance and accurate missing data imputation validated through experiments on wind farm datasets.

Conclusion: ZTFed-MAS2S is an effective and secure solution for overcoming data and privacy challenges in industrial wind power applications, improving both efficiency and trust.

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

*Md Anwar Hossen,Fatema Siddika,Wensheng Zhang,Anuj Sharma,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance limitations in Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) with a new approach, FedProtoKD, that improves global knowledge aggregation using dual-knowledge distillation and adaptive prototype margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the issue of sub-optimal global knowledge in HFL caused by the shrinking of aggregated prototypes when data is highly non-IID and models are heterogeneous.

Method: The proposed approach, FedProtoKD, enhances HFL through dual-knowledge distillation mechanisms utilizing clients' logits and prototype features, contrastive learning for trainable server prototypes, and adaptive prototype margins to resolve prototype shrinking.

Result: FedProtoKD achieves a performance improvement of 1.13% to 34.13% accuracy across diverse settings, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in HFL.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD offers a robust solution for handling statistical heterogeneity and privacy in HFL, mitigating prototype shrinking issues and improving model performance through innovative mechanisms.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

### [210] [Linear cost mutual information estimation and independence test of similar performance as HSIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18338)
*Jarek Duda,Jagoda Bracha,Adrian Przybysz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents HCR, a linear cost alternative to HSIC for evaluating statistical dependencies between large data samples, offering better sensitivity and dependence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and sensitive methods for analyzing dependencies between large data samples, as HSIC's computational complexity limits its usability.

Method: The proposed HCR method evaluates dependencies by reconstructing statistical relationships using mixed moments, with linear time computation ($O(n)$), and varying based on dimension ($O(d^2)$ for pairwise, $O(d^3)$ for triplewise dependencies).

Result: HCR provides higher dependence sensitivity in tests, linear scalability for large datasets, and a practical joint distribution model for approximating mutual information.

Conclusion: HCR is a computationally efficient and robust alternative to HSIC, enabling dependency analysis for high-dimensional and large datasets with improved sensitivity and practical performance.

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

TL;DR: This paper reviews the role of low-rank tensor decompositions in understanding the theoretical aspects of deep neural networks (NNs), such as expressivity, learnability, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified and accessible review of how low-rank tensor methods contribute to the theoretical understanding of deep NNs.

Method: The paper synthesizes existing approaches across multiple fields like computer science and mathematics to explain NNs through low-rank tensor decompositions.

Result: Low-rank tensor methods are shown to be fundamental in addressing key theoretical aspects of NNs, supported by their uniqueness guarantees and polynomial-time computation.

Conclusion: Low-rank tensor decompositions offer a coherent theoretical framework for analyzing deep NNs, promoting broader adoption and understanding of these methods in various communities.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

*André Quadros,Cassio Silva,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores combining Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR) and LLM-based intrinsic rewards to enhance RL agent performance in sparse reward environments, boosting efficiency and learning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reinforcement learning struggles in sparse reward environments due to the rarity of positive feedback. The authors aim to address this limitation by combining intrinsic motivation strategies to improve agent learning and efficiency.

Method: The proposed approach integrates VSIMR, which uses Variational AutoEncoders for rewarding state novelty, with LLM-derived intrinsic rewards that guide agents using pre-trained language model knowledge. This combination was tested within an Actor-Critic agent on the MiniGrid DoorKey environment.

Result: The combined strategy significantly enhanced agent performance and sampling efficiency compared to each individual strategy or a standard A2C agent, which failed in learning within this setup.

Conclusion: The dual intrinsic reward strategy complements exploration and exploitation effectively, with VSIMR focusing on discovering novel states and LLM-based rewards guiding agents towards task goals. This synergistic approach proves useful for sparse reward RL challenges.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

*Quanlin Chen,Yiyu Chen,Jing Huo,Tianyu Ding,Yang Gao,Yuetong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating local quadratic models based on gradients and Hessians from a global Gaussian Process (GP) to scale Bayesian Optimization (BO) for high-dimensional spaces, outperforming existing techniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Optimization struggles with efficiency in high-dimensional spaces due to challenges in balancing heterogeneous objective modeling and sampling efficiency.

Method: Instead of relying solely on local GPs, this method constructs multiple local quadratic models using derivatives from a single global GP, while addressing gradient vanishing issues and employing quadratic programming for sample selection.

Result: The proposed method improves the efficacy of TuRBO and yields better performance compared to existing high-dimensional BO approaches in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully combines local modeling with a global GP to address high-dimensional BO challenges, enhancing sampling efficiency and boosting optimization performance in various scenarios.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an RL framework for Verilog code generation, addressing inherent challenges through innovations like a specialized dataset, reward mechanism, and adaptive weighting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware description languages like Verilog face challenges in code generation due to concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity, and simulation complexity, necessitating novel solutions.

Method: Proposed an RL framework with a curated dataset (Veribench-53K), Trace-back based Rescore mechanism for enhancing reward feedback, and a sample-balanced weighting strategy integrated into an iterative RL pipeline.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in Verilog generation tasks, improving test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of RL-driven methods for generating structured code in hardware-focused areas and offers VERIRL as a public resource.

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods face challenges like limited labeled data, high false positives, and poor generalization for novel anomalies in time-series anomaly detection.

Method: DRTA combines a dynamic reward mechanism, variational autoencoders for reconstruction error, and active learning to balance exploration and exploitation during anomaly detection.

Result: Experimental results on Yahoo A1 and A2 datasets show consistent outperformance compared to unsupervised and semi-supervised methods in precision and recall.

Conclusion: The proposed framework, DRTA, is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how various data augmentation strategies impact Machine Unlearning (MU) performance, uncovering that augmentations like TrivialAug can considerably enhance unlearning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the role of systematic augmentation design in Machine Unlearning, an area that is under-investigated despite its importance in reducing memorization and ensuring privacy and efficient unlearning.

Method: The study examines MU methods such as SalUn, Random Label, and Fine-Tuning, experimenting with different augmentation strategies (e.g., TrivialAug) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various forget rates.

Result: Properly designed data augmentation, particularly TrivialAug, significantly improved MU effectiveness, reducing the Average Gap unlearning Metric by up to 40.12%, narrowing performance differences with retrained models.

Conclusion: Data augmentation design is vital for enhancing unlearning methods, playing a crucial role in privacy-preserving and efficient MU while reducing memorization.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although
a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying
forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve
unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

*Yifeng Peng,Xinyi Li,Zhemin Zhang,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Zhiding Liang,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an RL-based algorithm to tackle the barren plateau issue in Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), improving convergence speed and solution quality significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the barren plateau problem, a key challenge in the training of VQAs due to vanishing gradients in larger systems or deeper circuits.

Method: The paper employs reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization, to pre-train quantum circuit parameters before gradient-based optimization.

Result: Numerical experiments demonstrate enhanced convergence speed and solution quality across noisy conditions and various tasks. Multiple RL algorithms show comparable performance, indicating flexibility.

Conclusion: The RL-based initialization strategy is effective, flexible, and robust for overcoming barren plateaus in VQAs, aiding the scalability and deployment of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

*Jun Hou,Le Wang,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method, Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), for optimizing multimodal models when additional modalities add noise rather than useful information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of dynamically controlling the importance of modalities in multimodal learning, especially in scenarios where additional modalities introduce more noise than complementary information.

Method: BTW uses a non-parametric, bi-level weighting approach that combines instance-level KL divergence and modality-level MI to dynamically adjust modality importance during training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BTW significantly improves regression and classification performance on sentiment and clinical datasets.

Conclusion: BTW provides an effective, scalable approach for managing modality importance in multimodal learning, enhancing both regression and classification tasks without requiring additional parameters.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

### [219] [Enhancing Chemical Explainability Through Counterfactual Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18561)
*Łukasz Janisiów,Marek Kochańczyk,Bartosz Zieliński,Tomasz Danel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors propose counterfactual masking, a framework for molecular property prediction, replacing masked molecular structures with plausible alternatives generated by trained models, ensuring realistic evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for molecular property prediction often fail due to masking strategies that do not align with realistic molecular distributions, leading to unintuitive explanations.

Method: The authors introduce a novel approach that replaces masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled using generative models, and compares predictions to data-distributed counterfactual molecules rather than zeroed-out baselines.

Result: Their method achieves molecular realism and generates actionable counterfactuals, making it apt for benchmarking model explainers and enhancing insights in molecular property prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Counterfactual masking is a robust and generative framework that closes the gap between explainability and molecular design, advancing explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

### [220] [A Note on Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18564)
*Levi Rauchwerger,Ron Levie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper refines and extends previous work on the analysis of message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding their input space into the realm of graphon-signals, addressing several key limitations for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to address practical shortcomings in the application of graphon-signal analysis of MPNNs, as identified in a previous paper, by enhancing the theoretical framework and providing more comprehensive, applicable insights.

Method: The authors introduced refinements to the earlier results, including extending analysis to multidimensional signals, considering MPNNs with readout under cut distance, enhancing generalization bounds with robustness-type measures, and studying non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Result: The paper delivers theoretical advancements, refining graphon-signal analysis for MPNNs, and shows improved generalization bounds and applicability of MPNNs to broader network structures and signal types.

Conclusion: These refinements establish a stronger theoretical foundation for analyzing MPNNs and enable their application in more practical and diverse settings of graph machine learning.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

*Hao Zhou,Sibo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Stochastic PushForward (SPF) framework, which enhances data-driven forecasting models for complex systems by addressing long-term accuracy issues while optimizing memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges in data-driven forecasting for complex systems, such as long-term accuracy deterioration, high GPU memory needs, and short-term performance trade-offs.

Method: The SPF framework combines model predictions and ground truth using a stochastic acquisition strategy. It enables multi-step learning with reduced memory usage by precomputing predictions and avoiding storage of full unrolled sequences.

Result: Experiments using Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark demonstrate SPF's higher long-term accuracy compared to autoregressive methods, along with lower memory demands.

Conclusion: SPF offers a viable solution for complex simulations, balancing short- and long-term performance, and is particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

*Darin Tsui,Kunal Talreja,Amirali Aghazadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) trained on fine-tuned protein language model (pLM) embeddings for protein function prediction and design in low-data scenarios, demonstrating improved generalization and successful design of top-performing protein variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protein function prediction and design in data-scarce scenarios remain challenging, and existing methods like protein language models (pLMs) need better tools to interpret embeddings and generalize from limited data.

Method: The authors trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on fine-tuned ESM2 embeddings and tested them across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks to assess their effectiveness.

Result: SAEs, even with as few as 24 sequences, outperformed or competed with ESM2 baselines in function prediction and identified top-performing variants in 83% of design tasks.

Conclusion: SAEs provide biologically meaningful and compact latent representations that generalize well in low-data settings, making them valuable for protein function prediction and engineering.

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

TL;DR: The study introduces DrugReasoner, a fine-tuned large language model for predicting drug approval outcomes. It integrates molecular descriptors and comparative reasoning to provide accurate predictions with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize research investments in drug discovery by addressing the challenge of early prediction of drug approval outcomes with interpretable models.

Method: The paper presents DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based LLM built on the LLaMA architecture and refined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). It combines molecular descriptors with reasoning against structurally similar compounds.

Result: DrugReasoner achieved strong performance metrics (e.g., AUC of 0.732 and F1 score of 0.729 on the validation set) and outperformed conventional baselines and the ChemAP model in external datasets.

Conclusion: DrugReasoner demonstrates the effectiveness of reasoning-augmented LLMs in improving predictive accuracy and interpretability, showing potential as a valuable tool for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel sparse spectrum trading position and optimization algorithm to improve signal-based trading, achieving robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of diversification and robustness in principal portfolio approaches for signal-based trading.

Method: The authors propose a sparse spectrum trading position and introduce a Krasnosel’skii-Mann fixed-point algorithm with linear convergence for optimization.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robust performance across various situations in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The study provides a new approach with theoretical advancements in optimization algorithms, offering improved trading strategies in signal-based systems.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

*Weide Liu,Xiaoyang Zhong,Lu Wang,Jingwen Hou,Yuemei Luo,Jiebin Yan,Yuming Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data by combining multi-scale feature extraction and uncertainty estimation mechanisms. The approach improves generalization and robustness across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The common problem of distribution shifts in time series data between training and testing domains necessitates better generalization methods for unlabeled test data.

Method: The authors propose a multi-scale mixed input architecture to capture diverse features, coupled with an uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning, imposing a Dirichlet prior on labels to enhance domain adaptation.

Result: The approach yielded state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, significantly improved target domain prediction, and demonstrated lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE), indicating more reliable prediction confidence.

Conclusion: The combined model offers a robust solution for unsupervised domain adaptation in time series data, effectively handling domain shifts and setting new benchmarks in performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

### [226] [STRATA-TS: Selective Knowledge Transfer for Urban Time Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Guided Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18635)
*Yue Jiang,Chenxi Liu,Yile Chen,Qin Chao,Shuai Liu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STRATA-TS, a framework enhancing urban forecasting for cities with limited historical data. It uses a selective data retrieval and reasoning process to guide predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The severe data imbalance faced by urban forecasting models makes direct data transfer unreliable, necessitating a method to mitigate the risk of noise and negative transfer.

Method: STRATA-TS applies a patch-based temporal encoder to retrieve relevant sequences from data-rich cities and utilizes an LLM for reasoning over retrieved support and target inputs.

Result: Experiments on parking availability data from three cities show STRATA-TS outperforming existing forecasting methods, offering robust predictions and interpretability.

Conclusion: STRATA-TS proves effective in scarce data scenarios, showing consistent improvement in forecasting accuracy through selective and interpretable predictions.

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

*Ifrah Tariq,Ernest Fraenkel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Biologically Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a model that integrates multi-omics data for predicting responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and understanding resistance mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current immune checkpoint inhibitors exhibit variable patient responses, and the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Existing predictive models lack interpretability and fail to utilize the biological structure in multi-omics data.

Method: BDVAE integrates transcriptomic and genomic data using modality- and pathway-specific encoders with a modular architecture and variational inference to extract latent biological features.

Result: Applied to a pan-cancer cohort, BDVAE achieved a high prediction accuracy (AUC-ROC=0.94) on unseen data, identified nuanced resistance mechanisms, and correlated latent features with survival outcomes and clinical subtypes.

Conclusion: BDVAE provides interpretable, biologically structured insights into resistance mechanisms, emphasizing its utility for developing precision immunotherapy approaches.

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multimodal framework integrating textual sentiment and executive vocal dynamics for financial risk prediction, emphasizing insights from emotions during earnings calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge posed by information asymmetry and its amplification through corporate narratives in financial markets.

Method: Developed a Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM) to analyze emotional signals from teleconferences while integrating textual and acoustic features into an interpretable emotional state space.

Result: Multimodal features do not predict stock returns directionally but explain up to 43.8% of 30-day realized volatility. Emotional dynamics during executive transitions are key drivers.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach strengthens market interpretability and provides enhanced tools for detecting hidden corporate uncertainty, outperforming financials-only methods.

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FFT MoE, a novel framework for Federated Fine-Tuning, using sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters to address challenges in heterogeneous FL environments and outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations in current Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT) approaches, such as LoRA, which are unable to adapt efficiently in FL environments with heterogeneous client configurations and non-IID data distributions.

Method: The authors replace LoRA adapters with sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters, leveraging a lightweight gating network on each client for personalized expert selection and introduce an auxiliary loss to balance expert utilization amidst heterogeneity.

Result: FFT MoE achieves superior generalization performance and training efficiency compared to existing FFT methods across experiments in both IID and non-IID settings.

Conclusion: FFT MoE successfully addresses heterogeneity in Federated Learning environments, demonstrating promising improvements in performance and adaptability over baseline approaches.

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the privacy risks of retained data in approximate machine unlearning for differentially private models and introduces efficient auditing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address privacy concerns for retained samples after unlearning processes, especially for differentially private models.

Method: Proposing privacy criteria for both unlearned and retained samples and introducing an efficient membership inference attack (MIA) algorithm, A-LiRA, leveraging data augmentation.

Result: Experimental findings show that existing methods compromise retained samples' privacy under differential privacy.

Conclusion: New differentially private unlearning algorithms are necessary, as current ones inadvertently violate the privacy of retained samples in DP models.

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

*Taishi Nakamura,Satoki Ishikawa,Masaki Kawamura,Takumi Okamoto,Daisuke Nohara,Jun Suzuki,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of sparsity in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on memorization and reasoning capabilities, revealing different scaling behaviors based on sparsity parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the influence of sparsity introduced by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on performance, especially in memorization and reasoning tasks, as scaling laws in large language models evolve.

Method: The study systematically trains MoE Transformers varying parameters, sparsity levels, and routing strategies under fixed compute budgets, recording performance metrics including loss and accuracy for various benchmarks.

Result: Memorization tasks consistently benefit from increased total parameters, while reasoning tasks exhibit saturation or regression despite larger models and lower training losses. Adjustments in sparsity levels and routing strategies reveal limitations in overly sparse configurations.

Conclusion: Sparsity impacts reasoning negatively despite gains in model parameters or loss reduction, and traditional hyperparameter adjustments modulate sparsity-driven effects. The results emphasize careful tuning of sparsity dimensions to balance capabilities.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LRTab, a prompting-based approach for tabular understanding and reasoning by leveraging training data insights for enhanced model accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tabular reasoning is critical for data scientists, but current methods either compromise generalizability or fail to fully utilize training data.

Method: Proposes LRTab, which combines chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with a mechanism to learn from training data by predicting Prompt Conditions to correct reasoning errors.

Result: Experimental validation on WikiTQ and Tabfact datasets shows LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and outperforms prior methods in tabular reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LRTab effectively combines the strengths of dataset-specific finetuning and generalizable prompting methods to enhance accuracy in tabular reasoning, while maintaining efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Motivation: The timely detection of sepsis in ICU settings is critical, yet traditional machine learning methods struggle with challenges like incomplete time-series data and manual feature engineering.

Method: The approach integrates an autoencoder for feature extraction and a multilayer perceptron for sepsis risk prediction, coupled with a downsampling strategy and dynamic sliding window for real-time inference.

Result: The model is validated on three ICU cohorts, achieving accuracies of 74.6%, 80.6%, and 93.5%, surpassing traditional machine learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates superior robustness and clinical utility for early sepsis detection in diverse ICU environments.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

*V. S. Usatyuk,D. A. Sapoznikov,S. I. Egorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology to improve multi-class image classification efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant feature compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of efficient multi-class image classification by leveraging insights from physics and topology, focusing on compressing high-dimensional features while preserving classification accuracy.

Method: High-dimensional feature vectors are treated as spins on an LDPC graph-based Random-Bond Ising Model operated at Nishimori temperature. They use topological invariants to guide trapping set suppression and design specialized MET-QC-LDPC graphs for feature compression and improved classification.

Result: Features from ImageNet-10 and ImageNet-100 subsets are compressed 40x fewer parameters (32 or 64 dimensions) using topology-guided graphs, achieving 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100 despite massive dimension reduction.

Conclusion: The novel incorporation of physics and topology into graph-based feature representation leads to highly efficient embeddings with state-of-the-art classification performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for image classification.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

*Yi Liu,Hongji Zhang,Yiwen Wang,Dimitris Tsaras,Lei Chen,Mingxuan Yuan,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents StructRTL, a framework leveraging structural graph learning and knowledge distillation for improved RTL design quality estimation, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for RTL design quality estimation inadequately consider structural semantics, leading to less accurate predictions.

Method: The framework uses self-supervised learning on CDFGs combined with knowledge distillation from post-mapping netlists for quality estimation.

Result: StructRTL achieved state-of-the-art performance in various RTL design quality estimation tasks, surpassing previous methodologies.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural insights with cross-stage supervision enhances representation learning and quality estimation in RTL designs.

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

### [236] [FLAegis: A Two-Layer Defense Framework for Federated Learning Against Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18737)
*Enrique Mármol Campos,Aurora González Vidal,José Luis Hernández Ramos,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents FLAegis, a two-stage defense framework for identifying and mitigating Byzantine clients in Federated Learning (FL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the vulnerability of Federated Learning systems to Byzantine clients, which can disrupt the model training process via poisoning attacks.

Method: FLAegis uses symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify distinctions between benign and malicious updates, integrates spectral clustering for adversary detection, and employs an FFT-based aggregation function to mitigate remaining malicious effects.

Result: FLAegis exhibits superior performance in both detecting Byzantine behaviors and maintaining high model accuracy compared to existing methods, even against advanced poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that FLAegis effectively enhances the robustness and resilience of decentralized FL systems against adversarial manipulations.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

### [237] [Stability and Generalization for Bellman Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18741)
*Enoch H. Kang,Kyoungseok Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the statistical understanding of Bellman residual minimization (BRM) in the offline reinforcement learning setting, achieving new stability and risk bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the enforcement of Bellman consistency in offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning, as current methods face challenges despite recent advancements like SGDA-based BRM.

Method: The paper introduces a Lyapunov potential to analyze SGDA on neighboring datasets, establishing an O(1/n) stability and risk bound without additional variance reductions or regularization.

Result: The analysis achieves a doubling of the best known sample-complexity exponent for convex-concave saddle problems, stable under neural network parameterizations and minibatch SGD.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into the statistical performance of BRM in offline settings, contributing to its practical utility by ensuring a strong stability and excess risk guarantee.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

*Jiajun Li,Ran Hou,Yu Ding,Yixuan Li,Shisi Guan,Jiahui Duan,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Vincent Chau,Weiwei Wu,Wanyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method that reduces the complexity of solving large-scale MILP problems by focusing on constraints rather than variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research arises from the need to solve large-scale MILP problems faster, acknowledging that constraint reduction, as opposed to variable reduction, has been underexplored.

Method: The approach identifies critical inequality constraints that can be transformed into equalities to simplify MILP. It uses a labeling process for "tight" constraints and a multi-modal representation technique for prediction.

Result: Experimental outcomes reveal that the proposed method improves solution quality by over 50% and decreases computation time by 17.47% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that focusing on critical constraints effectively accelerates the MILP solving process while maintaining solution feasibility.

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraMemV2 presents a redesigned memory-layer architecture achieving performance parity with 8-expert Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, while reducing memory access costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models achieve efficiency by activating subsets of parameters but suffer from high memory access costs during inference. An improved memory-layer architecture can be a more efficient computational alternative.

Method: Five key innovations: integrating memory layers into every transformer block, simplifying value expansion with linear projections, leveraging FFN-based value processing, principled parameter initialization, and balancing computation ratios.

Result: UltraMemV2 matches the performance of 8-expert MoE models under the same computation and parameters, and surpasses them on memory-intensive tasks (+1.6 to +7.9 points in specific evaluations).

Conclusion: UltraMemV2 closes the performance gap between memory-layer architectures and high-performing MoE models, providing a highly efficient sparse computation alternative.

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

*Helen Pervez,Suyash Gaurav,Jukka Heikkonen,Jatin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS), a modular enforcement system for regulating AI agents at runtime without modifying their internals, demonstrating its reliability in blocking risky behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI ecosystems lack scalable and proactive governance mechanisms, posing risks in asynchronous multi-agent coordination.

Method: GaaS introduces runtime enforcement using declarative rules and a Trust Factor mechanism to score agent compliance and evaluate actions in simulations with diverse AI models.

Result: Results from simulations show GaaS effectively blocks high-risk behaviors and penalizes untrustworthy components, while maintaining system throughput.

Conclusion: GaaS offers infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable AI agent ecosystems, framing governance as a service without requiring agent cooperation or internal modifications.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWiFT is a debiasing framework that improves ML model fairness while maintaining performance using minimal resources, demonstrating superior results across multiple real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in ML models which poses significant ethical and social challenges, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Method: SWiFT identifies contributions of model parameters to bias and prediction and employs a two-step fine-tuning process using minimal data and computing resources.

Result: SWiFT consistently reduces bias, maintains or improves accuracy, and enhances model performance on out-of-distribution datasets.

Conclusion: The SWiFT framework provides an efficient and effective debiasing method that balances fairness and discriminative power without extensive retraining.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

TL;DR: This paper develops and evaluates a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for malware detection that optimizes both detection performance and rejection for manual labeling, showing improved resilience to concept drift in Android malware datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional classifiers struggle with concept drift in dynamic malware environments and cannot optimize when to reject samples for manual labeling. Current pipelines use active learning (AL) and rejection but lack integrated optimization.

Method: The paper formulates malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and trains a DRL agent to optimize classification performance and rejection of high-risk samples for manual labeling, tested on multi-year Android malware datasets.

Result: The DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent improved performance measured by Area Under Time (AUT), outperforming traditional classifiers by achieving average AUT improvements across different settings: 5.18, 14.49, and 10.06 units.

Conclusion: DRL provides an effective solution for malware detection that adapts to concept drift, improving detection resilience and long-term performance in dynamic malware environments.

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

*Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Jalal Etesami,Pouria Fatemi,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new bandit model for adaptive recommender systems where users compare items after consumption, leading to better performance and reduced regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in modeling user behavior in recommender systems by considering more reliable feedback from users after they consume items.

Method: A new bandit model is introduced where users consume an item and then compare it with another item from their history, combining theoretical guarantees with simulation analysis.

Result: The model achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees, and simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons outperforms simultaneous comparisons.

Conclusion: The model improves recommendation systems by leveraging historical items for reliable user feedback, showing theoretical and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-Flat, a method to promote flatter loss landscapes in continual learning, enhancing stability and memory retention across tasks. It also proposes C-Flat++ for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge in continual learning of balancing sensitivity to new tasks with stability in retaining past knowledge, overcoming limitations in sharpness-aware approaches.

Method: C-Flat promotes flatter loss landscapes tailored for continual learning and integrates easily within existing CL paradigms. C-Flat++ further improves efficiency with selective flatness-driven updates.

Result: Experiments show C-Flat enhances performance across diverse CL methods and datasets, while C-Flat++ significantly reduces update costs while maintaining effectiveness.

Conclusion: C-Flat and C-Flat++ offer effective and efficient solutions for continual learning, improving robustness and efficiency in handling sequential tasks.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

*Yunyang Cao,Juekai Lin,Wenhao Li,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOCHA, a framework for discovering dynamic, multi-order causal dependencies in temporal point processes, outperforming other methods in prediction and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes is vital for real-world event modeling. Traditional methods often miss multi-order and time-varying causal relationships.

Method: MOCHA uses a latent time-evolving graph modeled as a time-varying directed acyclic graph with learnable weights, enforcing acyclicity and sparsity constraints. The framework is end-to-end differentiable.

Result: Experiments show MOCHA's superior performance in event prediction and its ability to uncover meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Conclusion: MOCHA effectively combines causal discovery with temporal event dynamics, advancing prediction accuracy and interpretability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Motivation: Existing methods like DPO and GRPO limit exploration on tasks with long decision trajectories, creating the need for an approach that better balances exploration and stability.

Method: The proposed method, HAEPO, uses a cumulative logarithmic likelihood across trajectories combined with Plackett-Luce softmax for normalized weighting. It includes entropy regularization and a soft KL penalty to stabilize updates.

Result: Empirically, HAEPO demonstrates faster convergence, thorough exploration, alignment with rewards, and robust learning behavior, exceeding or matching the performance of baseline methods across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: HAEPO establishes a stable and interpretable framework that leverages full-trajectory history while effectively balancing exploration and stability in reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time
series research and applications.

### [249] [Distance-informed Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18903)
*Aishwarya Venkataramanan,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a variant of Neural Processes, that enhances uncertainty estimation using both global and local latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Neural Processes struggle with uncertainty calibration and fail to fully capture local data dependencies due to reliance only on global latent variables.

Method: DNP incorporates a global latent variable for task-level variation and a local latent variable for input similarity, using bi-Lipschitz regularization for preserving distance relationships in the latent space.

Result: Empirical tests show that DNP yields superior predictive performance and better uncertainty calibration for regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: DNP effectively addresses the limitations of standard Neural Processes and provides stronger, well-calibrated predictive capabilities for diverse tasks.

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

*Madhusudan Verma,Manoj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends generalization error bounds for neural ODEs by studying nonlinear dynamics functions under Lipschitz continuous constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work mainly focused on linear dynamics or restricted scenarios (like sampling intervals in Neural Controlled ODEs), leaving a gap in understanding for broader nonlinear cases.

Method: The authors derive generalization bounds using a Lipschitz condition on nonlinear dynamics, considering both time-dependent and time-independent functions.

Result: Solutions to neural ODEs under Lipschitz dynamics are shown to have bounded variations. Generalization bounds are established, revealing impacts of overparameterization and domain constraints.

Conclusion: This is the first derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear dynamics, broadening theoretical understanding.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across
multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose
HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention

superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

*Wenyin Zhou,Christopher Iliffe Sprague,Vsevolod Viliuga,Matteo Tadiello,Arne Elofsson,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an energy-based flow matching approach to enhance molecular structure generation, outperforming existing methods in protein docking and backbone generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in generative modeling have progressed molecular structure generation, but there is scope for improvement in training and inference methods, particularly using flow matching.

Method: The authors adopt an energy-based perspective to create a deep network mapping function for iterative transformation of source distributions to target molecular structures.

Result: The proposed method is shown to be theoretically sound and empirically effective, outperforming recent flow matching and diffusion models in benchmark tasks like protein docking and backbone generation.

Conclusion: This energy-based flow matching approach offers a conceptually simple, stable, and efficient solution for molecular structure generation, demonstrating strong potential for biological applications.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

### [254] [Estimating Conditional Covariance between labels for Multilabel Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18951)
*Laurence A. F. Park,Jesse Read*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, and Staged Logit) to evaluate how well they measure conditional label covariance in multilabel data. Multivariate Probit performs best with the lowest error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of measuring label dependence for multilabel data while accounting for the effects of covariates.

Method: The study examines three statistical models—Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, and Staged Logit—through experiments to compare their ability to estimate conditional covariance.

Result: All models measured constant and dependent covariance effectively based on covariance strength, but they falsely detected dependent covariance in cases of constant covariance. Multivariate Probit showed the lowest error rate.

Conclusion: Multivariate Probit is the most reliable model among the ones tested, though none are flawless in detecting the type of covariance in multilabel data.

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

*Kyriakos Hjikakou,Juan Diego Cardenas Cartagena,Matthia Sabatelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the use of Koopman-based embeddings for chaotic dynamical systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in prediction and control tasks using a novel methodology with the Lorenz system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to evaluate the generalizability and transferability of Koopman-based embeddings, especially in chaotic systems, to enhance performance for both prediction and control tasks.

Method: A three-stage pipeline was proposed: 1) learning Koopman embeddings using autoencoding, 2) pre-training a transformer for next-state prediction, and 3) fine-tuning the model for safety-critical control tasks.

Result: Koopman embeddings outperformed conventional methods like standard and physics-informed PCA in achieving accurate and data-efficient results. Additionally, fixing pre-trained transformer weights during fine-tuning did not degrade performance, highlighting the dynamical structure captured by the embeddings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Koopman embeddings are highly suitable for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning, offering reusable and general representations for chaotic systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

*Tim Kreuzer,Jelena Zdravkovic,Panagiotis Papapetrou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors introduce PAX-TS, a model-agnostic algorithm for explaining time series forecasting models and their predictions, focusing on multivariate channels and multi-granular insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forecasting models are advanced but opaque, offering little explanation for their predictions. Existing post-hoc methods are inadequate for the forecasting context, necessitating a new explainability approach.

Method: PAX-TS uses localized input perturbations to generate multi-granular explanations, identifying cross-channel correlations for multivariate forecasts and categorizing prediction patterns.

Result: The algorithm was tested on 7 models and 10 datasets, compared against other explanation methods, and identified 6 recurring pattern classes. It demonstrated effective differentiation in model behavior and correlated performance indicators.

Conclusion: PAX-TS provides detailed insights into forecasting models, revealing mechanisms and answering practical queries. It highlights key performance-related patterns and the role of cross-channel correlations.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

*Gary Simethy,Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo,Petar Durdevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDiff redefines missing value imputation in industrial time series, focusing on dynamic state evolution using a conditional denoising diffusion model, achieving superior results compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of imputation in industrial systems where dynamics are non-stationary, highly-dependent on control actions, and characterized by long data gaps.

Method: STDiff employs a conditional denoising diffusion model with causal bias, imputing missing values step-by-step based on recent known states and control or environmental inputs.

Result: STDiff outperforms window-based models both on a wastewater dataset (with the lowest errors, especially for larger gaps) and on an industrial dataset (dynamically plausible trajectories).

Conclusion: Dynamics-aware and explicitly conditioned imputation approaches, such as STDiff, offer robust solutions for industrial time series, with further potential across diverse domains.

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

*Luis Mantilla Calderón,Alán Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a physical dynamical system made of springs and sticks that is capable of approximating continuous functions and learning via energy dissipation, yielding comparable results to multi-layer perceptrons in regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the desire to understand learning systems from a physical perspective and explore how physical processes can approximate continuous functions and encode learning objectives.

Method: The system uses sticks for piecewise-linear function approximation, springs to encode mean squared error as potential energy, and converges to minimal energy configurations through dissipation.

Result: The proposed system demonstrates comparable performance to multi-layer perceptrons in regression tasks and reveals a thermodynamic learning barrier caused by environmental fluctuations limiting learning.

Conclusion: This novel model bridges the gap between physical systems and computational learning, providing insights into the thermodynamics of learning processes and advancing understanding of the interplay between physics and learning.

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

*Kelly Kurowski,Xixi Lu,Hajo A Reijers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores resource-centric next-activity prediction in Predictive Process Monitoring, finding that certain models and encodings outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing PPM research focuses on control-flow perspectives, ignoring resource-centric benefits like workload balancing and capacity forecasting. This paper aims to fill this gap.

Method: The study evaluates four prediction models (including LightGBM, Transformer, and Random Forest) and three encoding strategies using four real-life datasets, focusing on resource-centric process analysis.

Result: LightGBM and Transformer models perform best with a 2-gram activity transition encoding, while Random Forest benefits from an encoding that adds activity repetition features. The combined encoding achieves the highest accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of resource-centric next-activity prediction in enabling smarter resource management and workforce planning, paving the way for future research in the field.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

*Arash Jamshidi,Lauri Seppäläinen,Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich,Hoang Phuc Hau Luu,Anton Björklund,Kai Puolamäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GradStop, a gradient-based stochastic early stopping method for machine learning to overcome data wastage and overfitting associated with validation-set-based criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in machine learning models during training often leads to poor generalization on unseen data, and existing solutions like early stopping using a validation set reduce training data availability.

Method: GradStop leverages gradient information, which is already produced by gradient descent, to approximate a Bayesian posterior and define early stopping as a sampling problem from this posterior. This eliminates the need for a dedicated validation set.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GradStop achieves competitive test losses while allowing the entire dataset to be used for training, making it particularly useful in data-constrained scenarios like transfer learning.

Conclusion: GradStop offers a computationally efficient and effective alternative to traditional early stopping by fully utilizing the training data, providing benefits in scenarios with limited data availability.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

*Destiny Okpekpe,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares modern recurrent deep learning models, like state-space models (SSMs), with transformers on associative recall tasks, focusing on learning rate and scaling differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore performance, scaling effects, and optimization stability of recurrent and transformer-based models on associative recall tasks.

Method: Examines the role of learning rates, compares scaling in depth vs. width for recurrent and attention-based models, and performs architectural ablations of transformers and Mamba models.

Result: Shows learning rate critically affects recurrent model training, transformers struggle with shallow networks, and single-layer transformers exhibit induction head-like training dynamics.

Conclusion: Recurrent and transformer models have contrasting scaling behaviors and issues with training, highlighting areas for further research and stabilization.

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

*Vemula Sreenath,Filippo Gatti,Pierre Jehel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a machine learning architecture for ground motion modeling, focusing on enhancing interpretability and handling data imbalances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make ML-based ground motion models transparent and effectively handle imbalances in earthquake data.

Method: The authors developed a transparent ML architecture with a HazBinLoss function, which processes inputs separately and assigns weighted importance during training.

Result: The proposed model incorporates known seismological principles, resolves data imbalance issues, and performs comparably to established GMMs.

Conclusion: This transparent ML approach can improve decision-making for seismic risk and disaster planning initiatives.

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

*Paul Garnier,Jonathan Viquerat,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as tools to autonomously generate numerical schemes for solving physical systems, showcasing their ability to rediscover and extrapolate finite volume schemes across different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in evaluating whether GNNs can go beyond their traditional role in approximating solutions and contribute to deriving numerical methods for physical simulations, especially their ability to extrapolate beyond their training domain.

Method: The paper employs GNNs trained on specific datasets, leveraging symbolic regression and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to autonomously rediscover or discover finite volume schemes for differential equations like the heat equation.

Result: The study demonstrates that GNNs can extrapolate learned numerical schemes to out-of-distribution cases, rediscover standard first-order schemes, and autonomously identify higher-order corrections or midpoint schemes using unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: GNNs are not limited to functioning as approximators but have significant potential in developing novel numerical methods, supporting a growing paradigm in scientific computing where machine learning models contribute methodologically beyond established frameworks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

*Antonio Balordi,Lorenzo Manini,Fabio Stella,Alessio Merlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient method for Federated Unlearning by selectively updating sensitive model parameters instead of full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring privacy by erasing data from deep learning models, especially in the Federated Learning setting, is challenging because data is localized on clients, making traditional retraining approaches infeasible.

Method: The method utilizes second-order Hessian information to detect sensitive parameters, selectively resets them, and employs minimal federated retraining to achieve unlearning.

Result: The framework achieves strong privacy (near random Membership Inference Attack success) and high accuracy (Normalized Accuracy ≈ 0.9 compared to retrained benchmarks), while neutralizing backdoor attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively supports categorical and client data unlearning in Federated Learning, maintaining high model integrity and performance without requiring client data access during unlearning.

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance limitations of GNNs caused by graph topology issues like oversquashing and oversmoothing.

Method: Proposes TRIGON, which rewires graphs by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views, optimizing for better structural properties and classification performance.

Result: TRIGON produces rewired graphs with improved structural metrics like reduced diameter and increased spectral gap, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on node classification tasks.

Conclusion: TRIGON demonstrates the potential of triangulation-based graph rewiring to mitigate topology-induced GNN weaknesses, offering a significant step forward for both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

*Shaobo Ma,Chao Fang,Haikuo Shao,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces APT-LLM, a framework that accelerates large language model inference at arbitrary precision via innovations in data formats, matrix operations, memory management, and kernel mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational inefficiencies and barriers that limit real-time deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the context of ultra-low-bit quantization and GPU support.

Method: The authors propose a scheme involving a new data format called bipolar-INT, a novel matrix multiplication method for arbitrary precision, an efficient memory management system leveraging shared memory, and a kernel mapping method for dynamic optimization.

Result: In benchmarks, APT-LLM achieves up to 3.99× speedup compared to FP16 baselines and 2.16× over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On newer GPUs like RTX 4090 and H800, it achieves up to 2.44× and 1.65× speedups, respectively.

Conclusion: APT-LLM demonstrates significant computational efficiency improvements for LLM inference, making it a promising solution for broader and faster deployment of AI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

*Jonathan Erskine,Taku Yamagata,Raúl Santos-Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for improving preference-based reinforcement learning by integrating multi-annotator feedback modeling and active learning techniques to address noisy input and prioritize informative actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in preference-based reinforcement learning by reducing dependence on costly and scarce expert input, particularly in environments where human feedback errors are common or feedback availability is limited.

Method: Combines probabilistic crowd modeling to deal with noisy multi-annotator feedback and active learning for entropy-based feedback prioritization. It extends the Advise algorithm to incorporate multiple trainers, estimate annotator reliability dynamically, and query the most informative actions.

Result: Demonstrated in synthetic and real-world-inspired tasks (e.g., Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake, Type 1 Diabetes control in the UVA/Padova simulator). Agents trained with uncertain trajectory feedback show faster learning, and the approach outperforms baselines in the diabetes control task.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves learning efficiency and effectiveness in preference-based reinforcement learning tasks, particularly in complex, real-world settings like blood glucose control.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

*Robin Thériault,Daniele Tantari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes dense associative memory (DAM) with a focus on stability, interpretability, and efficiency of training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore DAM models due to their robustness to adversarial examples and their relation to advanced machine learning paradigms, such as attention mechanisms and generative diffusion models.

Method: Using a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts units, the study performs statistical mechanics analysis to derive saddle-point equations, proposes a regularization scheme for stable training, and develops a network-growing algorithm for reducing training costs.

Result: The study offers interpretable solutions for classification problems and finds a hierarchy of weights corresponding to saddle points. The proposed regularization and network-growing method significantly stabilize and accelerate training.

Conclusion: Dense associative memory networks can be optimized for better stability, reduced computational costs, and interpretability by leveraging theoretical insights and a hierarchical training approach.

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses robustness challenges in deep learning for safety-critical applications by proposing 'tower robustness,' a novel metric for pre-deployment assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing robustness in safety-critical neural models face a trade-off between precision and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors perform a comparative analysis of existing robustness definitions and propose 'tower robustness,' a hypothesis-testing-based metric for probabilistic robustness.

Result: The paper demonstrates that 'tower robustness' is both rigorous and efficient, showing its advantages and applicability in pre-deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed metric advances the assessment methodologies for neural models, leading to improved understanding and safety in critical applications.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

*Jingyao Wu,Matthew Barthet,David Melhart,Georgios N. Yannakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for recognizing emotions by focusing on ambiguity and dynamic changes in emotional annotations. It outperforms conventional models in certain evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to continuous emotion recognition fail to address the inherent ambiguity or treat ambiguity as static, ignoring temporal dynamics.

Method: Introduced an ambiguity-aware ordinal framework that models emotion ambiguity through its rate of change, evaluated on corpora RECOLA and GameVibe using metrics like CCC and SDA.

Result: Ordinal representations outperformed conventional models, achieving superior CCC and SDA scores for unbounded labels and excelling in SDA for bounded traces.

Conclusion: Ordinal emotion representations are highly effective in capturing temporal dynamics and relative changes in annotated emotion traces, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Token Order Prediction (TOP) as a more effective auxiliary objective for language model training than the existing Multi-Token Prediction (MTP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving language model training by addressing the shortcomings of Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), which struggles with accuracy and benchmark performance.

Method: Developed the Token Order Prediction (TOP) approach using a learning-to-rank loss instead of exact token prediction in MTP.

Result: TOP outperformed NTP and MTP across eight NLP benchmarks using models of different parameter sizes (340M, 1.8B, 7B).

Conclusion: Token Order Prediction (TOP) is a superior auxiliary training objective for improving language models, requiring fewer computational resources than MTP and delivering better benchmark performance.

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is

TL;DR: The paper refines the concept of Persistent Stochastic Non-Interference (PSNI) for stochastic systems by introducing Exact PSNI (EPSNI), which is based on weak-exact equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the PSNI framework for better control over quantitative properties and to accommodate performance-oriented perspectives in stochastic systems.

Method: The authors develop weak-exact equivalence by relaxing internal actions and utilize it to define Exact PSNI (EPSNI), while demonstrating its compositional properties and equivalence with traditional PSNI.

Result: EPSNI is shown to maintain the same characterizations and compositionality properties as PSNI, confirming its robustness for reasoning about non-interference.

Conclusion: Weak-exact equivalence provides a refined foundation for analyzing non-interference in stochastic systems, offering improved precision and flexibility.

Abstract: Persistent Stochastic Non-Interference (PSNI) was introduced to capture a
quantitative security property in stochastic process algebras, ensuring that a
high-level process does not influence the observable behaviour of a low-level
component, as formalised via lumpable bisimulation. In this work, we revisit
PSNI from a performance-oriented perspective and propose a new characterisation
based on a refined behavioural relation. We introduce \emph{weak-exact
equivalence}, which extends exact equivalence with a relaxed treatment of
internal (\(\tau\)) actions, enabling precise control over quantitative
observables while accommodating unobservable transitions. Based on this, we
define \emph{Exact PSNI} (EPSNI), a variant of PSNI characterised via
weak-exact equivalence. We show that EPSNI admits the same bisimulation-based
and unwinding-style characterisations as PSNI, and enjoys analogous
compositionality properties. These results confirm weak-exact equivalence as a
robust foundation for reasoning about non-interference in stochastic systems.

Motivation: To understand how well large language models can assist in proof automation using proof assistants, addressing their capabilities and limitations.

Method: The authors conducted a case study on two mature Rocq projects (hs-to-coq and Verdi), evaluating LLM-generated proofs through both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: The study revealed that context and external dependencies aid proof generation, LLMs excel at smaller proofs but also handle large proofs, their performance differs across verification projects, and they can produce both smart and flawed proofs.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential but exhibit varied performance in automated proof generation, excelling in certain areas while occasionally making mistakes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can potentially help with verification using
proof assistants by automating proofs. However, it is unclear how effective
LLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two
mature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative
analysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the
same source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform
great on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform
differently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate
concise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but
can also make odd mistakes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper enhances offline reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicle planning by addressing data imbalance through smarter data curation strategies, achieving significant safety improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of extreme data imbalance in real-world driving logs for autonomous vehicles, which leads to unsafe and unreliable policies when using uniform data sampling.

Method: Six distinct data curation strategies are evaluated, categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based. These methods are applied at both timestep and scenario levels and tested using Conservative Q-Learning agents in the Waymax simulator.

Result: All data curation methods outperformed the baseline, with model uncertainty-based curation achieving the best safety improvements, reducing collision rates from 16.0% to 5.5%.

Conclusion: Smarter, non-uniform data sampling is essential for safe autonomous vehicle policies, with different strategies excelling at either reactive safety or long-horizon planning.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

TL;DR: The paper presents NRTrans, a framework enhancing LLM-generated robot control programs through error verification and feedback mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inconsistency and high error rates in LLM-generated robot control programs motivated the development of solutions to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Method: The framework introduces a Robot Skill Language (RSL) for abstraction, coupled with a compiler and debugger to verify and refine programs by providing feedback for fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments validate NRTrans as superior to existing methods across various LLMs and tasks, achieving high success rates especially for light-weight models.

Conclusion: NRTrans proves effective in improving accuracy and reliability for LLM-based robotic applications, offering correctness guarantees before deployment.

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range
of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: The study successfully presents a framework suited for maintenance task automation using autonomous robots, providing insights into combining offline and online data and optimizing computational techniques.

Abstract: The research and development of intelligent automation solutions is a
ground-breaking point for the factory of the future. A promising and
challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in
the field of maintenance. For this purpose, the robot system must be able to
plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths.
Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational

this work, an approach is presented, which is especially suited to solve the
problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose, offline data from CAD is
combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic
filter, to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the
different tasks, a method is explained, which use a symbolic description,
founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For
path planning we use global state-of-the art algorithms with a method that
allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning
time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of AI systems like high power consumption and poor adaptability in resource-constrained applications, especially planetary exploration.

Method: The study emulates rodent-inspired associative learning and spatial cognition (including place and grid cells) in neuromorphic robots tested in maze environments for real-time learning.

Result: The integration of biological spatial cognition models enables neuromorphic robots to learn associative tasks online and adapt effectively in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: This work bridges biological spatial learning concepts with robotic systems, advancing autonomous navigation and real-time learning in constrained applications.

Abstract: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable
prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However,
the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as
highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in
SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these
issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots
by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning
enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events.
By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic
environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance.
This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using
neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights
from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models,
we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time

*Nicky Zimmerman,Joel Loo,Ayush Agrawal,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SignLoc is a localization method for robots that uses navigation signs to determine position on publicly available maps like floor plans and OpenStreetMap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigation signs and maps are common aids for human way-finding, but their potential for robot localization is underutilized. This paper seeks to fill this gap.

Method: The paper proposes the SignLoc framework, which extracts navigation graphs from maps and matches sign data to these graphs using a probabilistic model within a Monte Carlo framework.

Result: SignLoc was tested in various large-scale environments, and successfully localized robots using data from only one or two detected signs.

Conclusion: SignLoc demonstrates a robust and efficient approach to robot localization using navigation signs and publicly available maps, without requiring prior sensor-based mapping.

Abstract: Navigation signs and maps, such as floor plans and street maps, are widely
available and serve as ubiquitous aids for way-finding in human environments.
Yet, they are rarely used by robot systems. This paper presents SignLoc, a
global localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the
robot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap
(OSM) graphs -- without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a
navigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic
observation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected
signs to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte
Carlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part
of a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental
results show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one
to two signs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP), a tri-level framework enabling robots to perform multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated motion, addressing articulated objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in dynamic environments, existing methods that separate navigation and manipulation are limited.

Method: They propose an Augmented Configuration Space (A-Space) that unifies task constraints for navigation and manipulation. The SMMP framework integrates task planning, motion optimization, and intermediate goal refinement.

Result: Simulation studies show an 84.6% higher task success rate versus baselines. Real-world validation involves manipulation of rigid and articulated objects in diverse setups, with tasks spanning up to 14 sequential steps.

Conclusion: Modeling scene kinematics in planning enhances scalability and generalizability for robotic manipulation, surpassing traditional task-specific constraint methods.

Abstract: We present a Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP) framework that
can solve long-horizon multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated
whole-body motion, even when interacting with articulated objects. By
abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them
with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace
(A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation
and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot
base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient
planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action
sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion
planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired
configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan
refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our
simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6\%
higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real
robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven
types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii)
long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the
significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than
encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable
approach to complex robotic manipulation.

capabilities of DTs, ranging from computer-aided remote control to cloud-based
fleet coordination. Developing such services starts with the software
architecture. However, the scarcity of DT architectural guidelines poses a
challenge for engineering automotive DTs. Currently, the only DT architectural
standard is the one defined in ISO 23247. Though not developed for automotive
systems, it is one of the few feasible starting points for automotive DTs. In
this work, we investigate the suitability of the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for developing automotive DTs. Through the case study of
developing an Adaptive Cruise Control DT for a 1/10\textsuperscript{th}-scale
autonomous vehicle, we identify some strengths and limitations of the reference
architecture and begin distilling future directions for researchers,
practitioners, and standard developers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning technique where robots learn policies by imitating predictive models of human motion, using human interaction data zero-shot on robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As robots become more human-like, leveraging large datasets of human-environment interactions for training robots offers a novel learning opportunity.

Method: The paper proposes training robot sensorimotor policies by tracking predictions from human motion models directly, bypassing traditional gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior performance across robots and tasks compared to baselines, reducing the need for dense reward design or extensive curricula in manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: This method efficiently leverages human motion data to train robots, opening up scalable and diverse applications using modern human-scene interaction datasets.

Abstract: As the embodiment gap between a robot and a human narrows, new opportunities
arise to leverage datasets of humans interacting with their surroundings for
robot learning. We propose a novel technique for training sensorimotor policies
with reinforcement learning by imitating predictive models of human motions.
Our key insight is that the motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot
end-effectors closely mirrors the motion of corresponding human body keypoints.
This enables us to use a model trained to predict future motion on human data
\emph{zero-shot} on robot data. We train sensorimotor policies to track the
predictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states,
while optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely
bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which
limit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern
human-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can
work across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large
margin. In addition, we find that tracking a human motion model can substitute
for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks. Code,

TL;DR: Current precision agriculture datasets are often collected under controlled environments, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. This paper introduces AgriChrono, a robotic platform for collecting diverse, synchronized agricultural data under dynamic field conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing agricultural datasets are limited by their controlled environments, lacking sensor diversity and not addressing real-world dynamic challenges like crop variation and illumination changes.

Method: AgriChrono integrates RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU sensors for synchronized long-term data collection in agricultural fields, enabling dynamic and varied data acquisition.

Result: Benchmarks of 3D reconstruction models on the AgriChrono dataset demonstrate challenges in real-world farming conditions, emphasizing its utility for generalization research.

Conclusion: AgriChrono serves as a tool to enhance the robustness and generalization of models for precision agriculture, capturing essential dynamic field conditions.

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often
with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions
fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination
changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models
trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to
real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel
robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture
the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform
integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition
of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable
long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.
We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the
AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world
field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for
advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions. The code and dataset

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a video-based robotic failure detection method leveraging spatio-temporal information about robot actions and task-relevant objects, achieving performance improvements through data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems often fail at detecting task execution failures robustly in diverse real-world scenarios, necessitating a reliable and adaptive failure detection framework.

Method: The method integrates spatio-temporal knowledge from robot actions and task-relevant objects in video data while introducing data augmentation techniques with variable frame rates and test-time augmentations to enhance performance.

Result: On the ARMBench dataset, the proposed method improved the F1 score from 77.9 to 80.0 with data augmentation, and further to 81.4 with test-time augmentation, without additional computational expense.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal information is critical for effective failure detection in robotics, and the findings suggest further exploration of related heuristics could lead to better implementations.

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code

*Li Sun,Jiefeng Wu,Feng Chen,Ruizhe Liu,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Current robotic manipulation suffers from ineffective policy learning due to task-agnostic scene representations. HyperTASR introduces dynamic, task-specific representations via a hypernetwork framework, boosting performance in simulated and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in robotic manipulation, particularly the inability of existing systems to adapt visual representations dynamically to task-specific needs, a capability seen in human cognition.

Method: HyperTASR employs a hypernetwork framework to modulate scene representations dynamically based on task objectives and phases of execution. The architecture creates transformation parameters conditioned on the task and state.

Result: HyperTASR showed significant performance improvements in robotic manipulation benchmarks. Ablation studies and attention visualizations validate its effectiveness in focusing on task-relevant scene information.

Conclusion: HyperTASR enhances robotic manipulation by dynamically adapting representations, achieving human-like selective perception, compatibility with existing frameworks, and substantial gains in learning efficiency.

Abstract: Effective policy learning for robotic manipulation requires scene
representations that selectively capture task-relevant environmental features.
Current approaches typically employ task-agnostic representation extraction,
failing to emulate the dynamic perceptual adaptation observed in human
cognition. We present HyperTASR, a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates
scene representations based on both task objectives and the execution phase.
Our architecture dynamically generates representation transformation parameters
conditioned on task specifications and progression state, enabling
representations to evolve contextually throughout task execution. This approach
maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy learning frameworks
while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed. Unlike
methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic
representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between
task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning
efficiency and representational quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate substantial performance
improvements across different representation paradigms. Through ablation
studies and attention visualization, we confirm that our approach selectively
prioritizes task-relevant scene information, closely mirroring human adaptive
perception during manipulation tasks. The project website is at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to improve preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) for agile drone control, demonstrating better performance and human alignment both in simulation and real environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of crafting reward functions for inherently subjective and complex tasks like acrobatic drone flight, where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion.

Method: The authors extend Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO) by proposing Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), enhancing preference modeling and learning stability.

Result: Their method achieves 88.4% shaped reward performance compared to 55.2% by standard Preference PPO, and successfully transfers simulation-trained policies to real drones for acrobatic maneuvers.

Conclusion: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) is effective in capturing nuanced, human-centered objectives, outperforming manually designed rewards and proving applicable across physical and simulated tasks.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement
with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in
capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated
domains.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances system feature support, improves runtime scalability, and successfully identifies system issues, providing advancements over existing tools.

Abstract: Designing robotic systems to act autonomously in unforeseen environments is a
challenging task. This work presents a novel approach to use formal
verification, specifically Statistical Model Checking (SMC), to verify system
properties of autonomous robots at design-time. We introduce an extension of
the SCXML format, designed to model system components including both Robot
Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and Behavior Tree (BT) features. Further, we
contribute Autonomous Systems to Formal Models (AS2FM), a tool to translate the
full system model into JANI. The use of JANI, a standard format for
quantitative model checking, enables verification of system properties with
off-the-shelf SMC tools. We demonstrate the practical usability of AS2FM both
in terms of applicability to real-world autonomous robotic control systems, and
in terms of verification runtime scaling. We provide a case study, where we
successfully identify problems in a ROS 2-based robotic manipulation use case
that is verifiable in less than one second using consumer hardware.
Additionally, we compare to the state of the art and demonstrate that our
method is more comprehensive in system feature support, and that the
verification runtime scales linearly with the size of the model, instead of
exponentially.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance surgical safety and visual experience in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) by overcoming limitations of existing Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) approaches, such as reduced visibility under uncertainties and disturbances.

Method: A robust framework, VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), was developed. This utilizes Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for quantifying uncertainties and employs an uncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) along with chance constraints for safety-aware trajectory optimization.

Result: The proposed method was validated through simulations and experiments on a commercial robotic platform, demonstrating remarkable target visibility (>99.9%) and reduced unnecessary camera motion compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The VisionSafeEnhanced VPC framework effectively addresses uncertainty-related challenges in autonomous laparoscope control, ensuring safety and maintaining high surgical visual quality during MIS procedures.

Abstract: Autonomous control of the laparoscope in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive
Surgery (MIS) has received considerable research interest due to its potential
to improve surgical safety. Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual
Servoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the
existence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement
noise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual
experience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and
uncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that
guarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic +
stochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual
model uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based
on uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization
framework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a
uncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given
based on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously
formulated based on probabilistic approximation. This uncertainty aware
formulation enables adaptive control effort allocation, minimizing unnecessary
camera motion while maintaining robustness. The proposed method is validated
through comparative simulations and experiments on a commercial surgical robot
platform (MicroPort MedBot Toumai) performing a sequential multi-target lymph
node dissection. Compared with baseline methods, the framework maintains
near-perfect target visibility (>99.9%), reduces tracking e

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the TIG algorithm produces shorter paths with fewer turns and faster computation times compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, and other algorithms. It also excels in real-time collision avoidance in dynamic and partially known environments.

Conclusion: The TIG algorithm is efficient, producing smooth paths quickly while outperforming existing static and dynamic path planning methods, making it valuable for UAV navigation in diverse operational scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF

Conclusion: HuBE establishes a strong foundation for human-like transferable behavior execution in humanoid robots.

Abstract: Achieving both behavioral similarity and appropriateness in human-like motion

the lack of cross-embodiment adaptability. To address this problem, we propose
HuBE, a bi-level closed-loop framework that integrates robot state, goal poses,

heterogeneous humanoid robots. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple commercial
platforms demonstrate that HuBE significantly improves motion similarity,
behavioral appropriateness, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art
baselines, establishing a solid foundation for transferable and human-like

Motivation: To achieve scalable and efficient coordination for item pickup and delivery tasks in real-world scenarios through multi-robot systems using natural language instructions.

Method: The paper integrates natural language processing, spatial decomposition using Voronoi tessellation, relay planning, and motion execution. Commands are interpreted by LLaMA3 to define delivery tasks, while a finite-state machine ensures robust robot operation.

Result: DELIVER reduces per-agent workloads by 55% and effectively scales across different team sizes without increasing mission cost. Active relay agents remain low as team sizes grow, confirming system efficiency.

Conclusion: DELIVER demonstrates modularity, scalability, and efficient coordination in multi-robot systems, offering advancements in cyber-physical system integration.

Abstract: We present DELIVER (Directed Execution of Language-instructed Item Via
Engineered Relay), a fully integrated framework for cooperative multi-robot
pickup and delivery driven by natural language commands. DELIVER unifies
natural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and
motion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world
settings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of
LLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The
environment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define
robot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points
along shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs
each robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the
MultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo
simulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results
show that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes
while reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent
system. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team
size increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent
utilization. These findings underscore DELIVER's modular and extensible

Motivation: Traditional methods for creating terrain traversability datasets expose robots to unsafe conditions, creating risks to equipment and safety.

Method: ZeST uses LLM-based visual reasoning to generate real-time traversability maps in a zero-shot fashion, avoiding risky, real-world data collection.

Result: The proposed method shows practical success by providing safer navigation and consistently reaching targets in both indoor and outdoor settings.

Conclusion: ZeST represents a cost-effective, scalable, and safer alternative for advancing autonomous navigation systems.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art
methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

*Juan Carlos Saborío,Marc Vinci,Oscar Lima,Sebastian Stock,Lennart Niecksch,Martin Günther,Alexander Sung,Joachim Hertzberg,Martin Atzmüller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for robotic assistants that integrates real-time sensor data and planners to address uncertainty and perception errors in human intention recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current robotic systems which either lack autonomy due to reliance on explicit prompts or oversimplify human intention recognition by assuming near-perfect information.

Method: The authors use an intention-recognition Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to make robots resilient to sensor noise and uncertainties. The framework merges real-time sensor data with cooperative planning mechanisms.

Result: The framework has been tested on a physical robot, demonstrating its viability and yielding promising results.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves the robot's autonomy and capacity for cooperative behavior under uncertainty, marking progress in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of
multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced
to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to
uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a
combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuadKAN, a vision-guided quadruped locomotion control framework combining proprioceptive and visual inputs using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and spline parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quadruped motion control, especially for robustness on varied terrains using proprioception and vision inputs.

Method: QuadKAN employs spline-encoded proprioception and a fusion mechanism for visual-proprioceptive data, trained using PPO and leveraging MMDR.

Result: QuadKAN surpasses existing baselines in performance across dynamic terrains, achieving higher returns, longer distances, and fewer collisions.

Conclusion: Spline-parameterized functions present a simple and effective approach for vision-guided quadruped locomotion, demonstrating robust performance and interpretability.

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the validation of spacecraft attitude control algorithms using real-world hardware setups and fault simulation.

Method: The authors designed a HIL system using brushless DC motors, CAN bus communication, embedded computers, and simulated sensor data to test adaptive control laws under reaction wheel failure conditions.

Result: The paper introduces fault induction methods and shares the challenges encountered in validating the control systems.

Conclusion: This work enhances the testing framework for satellite control systems, emphasizing the importance of hardware-based validation and failure simulation techniques.

Abstract: We propose the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test of an adaptive satellite

Previous simulations and Software-in-the-Loop testing have prompted further
experiments to explore the validity of the controller with real momentum
exchange devices in the loop. This work is a step toward a comprehensive
testing framework for validation of spacecraft attitude control algorithms. The
proposed HIL testbed includes brushless DC motors and drivers that communicate
using a CAN bus, an embedded computer that executes control and adaptation
laws, and a satellite simulator that produces simulated sensor data, estimated
attitude states, and responds to actions of the external actuators. We propose
methods to artificially induce failures on the reaction wheels, and present
related issues and lessons learned.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a path planning algorithm optimized for faster convergence compared to similar methods, demonstrated in both simulated and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Path planning is critical in robotics and automation, yet balancing accuracy and computational efficiency in heuristics remains an unsolved challenge.

Method: The method involves defining edges as generalized vectors, utilizing similarity indexes for directional filtering, and estimating heuristic direction costs during edge evaluation. This enables goal-biased exploration.

Result: DIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners, achieving faster convergence in tested scenarios (R^4 to R^16) and real-world environments.

Conclusion: DIT* efficiently combines direction-based filtering and heuristic evaluation, offering significant improvements in path planning performance across multiple planning scenarios.

Abstract: Optimal path planning requires finding a series of feasible states from the
starting point to the goal to optimize objectives. Popular path planning
algorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to
guide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally
efficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting
nature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based
planner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge,
resulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized
vectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that
selects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated
direction cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows
the exploration to share directional information efficiently. DIT* convergence
faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on tested problems
in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments with
various planning tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces URSA, a method for autonomous skill discovery in robots without human supervision, and demonstrates its effectiveness in diverse locomotion tasks and damage adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations of existing skill discovery methods, such as the need for manually defined skill spaces and inefficient heuristics, and to enable robots to autonomously learn diverse skills directly in the real world.

Method: The authors extend the Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC) framework to create URSA, which allows for the autonomous discovery of diverse, high-performing robotic skills in both simulation and real-world environments.

Result: The proposed URSA method successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot and outperforms baselines in most real-world damage adaptation scenarios.

Conclusion: URSA represents a significant advancement in autonomous robotic learning by enabling continuous skill discovery and adaptability with limited human supervision, paving the way for more autonomous and capable robots.

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

*Christopher Chandler,Bernd Porr,Giulia Lafratta,Alice Miller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a real-time model checking-based planning method for autonomous robots, enabling multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance without pre-computed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve autonomous robot planning and obstacle avoidance by utilizing real-time strategies inspired by biological agents.

Method: A specialized model checking algorithm generates real-time plans on low-powered devices. 2D LiDAR data discretization handles environmental variations, and forward depth-first search is used for multi-step planning.

Result: The approach successfully navigates cul-de-sac and playground scenarios, outperforming reactive agents by efficiently creating multi-step plans for obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: Model checking can enhance autonomous vehicle planning by making it safer, more reliable, and explainable, serving as a key instructional study in the field.

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoRing, an imitation learning framework to autonomously perform precise intraocular foreign body ring manipulation under uncertain kinematic conditions and uncalibrated microscopy setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic systems for intraocular surgeries rely on manual teleoperation, which has steep learning curves and difficulty handling kinematic uncertainties.

Method: The study proposes AutoRing, which utilizes dynamic RCM calibration and a novel RCM-ACT architecture combining action-chunking transformers with kinematic realignment, trained on stereo visual data and expert demonstrations.

Result: AutoRing achieves autonomy in intraocular manipulation tasks like ring grasping and positioning without depth sensing and performs reliably under uncalibrated microscopy conditions.

Conclusion: The research offers a framework for intelligent surgical systems capable of performing complex intraocular procedures autonomously, reducing reliance on manual operations.

Abstract: Intraocular foreign body removal demands millimeter-level precision in
confined intraocular spaces, yet existing robotic systems predominantly rely on
manual teleoperation with steep learning curves. To address the challenges of
autonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable
motion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we
propose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular
foreign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration
to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument
variation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines
action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained
solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert
demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring
grasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental
validation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy
conditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent
eye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures.

*Alex LaGrassa,Zixuan Huang,Dmitry Berenson,Oliver Kroemer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to efficiently plan in high-dimensional spaces by generating adaptive dynamics models tailored to specific tasks, doubling planning speed with minimal performance compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional planning tasks, like deformable object manipulation, require dynamics models that balance computational efficiency and detail to effectively meet task requirements.

Method: A diffusion-based model predicts resolutions for different object regions using planning query specifications. Data collection involves a two-stage process optimizing resolution via predictive dynamics and closed-loop task performance.

Result: On a tree-manipulation task, the method achieved twice the planning speed compared to full-resolution models while maintaining task performance within acceptable limits.

Conclusion: This approach suggests a pathway to use prior planning data for creating computationally efficient, adaptive dynamics models applicable to new tasks.

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

*Hao Shi,Bin Xie,Yingfei Liu,Lin Sun,Fengrong Liu,Tiancai Wang,Erjin Zhou,Haoqiang Fan,Xiangyu Zhang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MemoryVLA is a framework inspired by human memory systems for enhancing long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks require temporal context, which mainstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models struggle with. Inspired by human memory systems, the paper addresses the need for integrating working and long-term memory mechanisms to improve task performance.

Method: The MemoryVLA framework uses a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to encode observations into tokens forming working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores episodic details and semantic information. The memory system dynamically retrieves, updates, and fuses information to inform a temporally-aware action generation system.

Result: MemoryVLA achieves high success rates across simulation and real-world robotic tasks, outperforming baselines like CogACT and pi-0 by significant margins (+14.6% in Bridge suite and +26% in real-world long-horizon tasks).

Conclusion: MemoryVLA effectively incorporates memory systems for improved decision-making in robotic manipulation, demonstrating superior performance in complex tasks compared to existing models.

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scalable and generalizable execution-grounded runtime environments for training LLMs are limited, restricting the advancement of ML agents.

Method: CTF-Dojo was developed as a runtime comprising containerized CTF-style challenges and integrated with CTF-Forge, an automated pipeline to rapidly configure execution environments for LLM training.

Result: Training LLM agents on execution-verified data from CTF-Dojo yielded performance gains of up to 11.6% on established benchmarks and set a new state-of-the-art with a model score of 31.9% Pass@1.

Conclusion: Execution-grounded training via CTF-Dojo is effective and critical for advancing ML agent capabilities, offering a scalable alternative to proprietary platforms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study compares human and large language model (LLM) comprehension of clean and confusing code, finding that both exhibit similar confusion indicators, and proposes a data-driven method to detect confusing code segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether humans and large language models (LLMs) experience confusion in the same code segments, which can improve LLM integration into software engineering workflows and guide further LLM development.

Method: The researchers analyzed LLM perplexity and human neurophysiological responses (EEG-based fixation-related potentials) to code comprehension, comparing clean and confusing code.

Result: Results showed that LLM perplexity spikes correlate with human physiological indicators of confusion both in terms of location and magnitude.

Conclusion: Humans and LLMs are similarly confused by certain code segments, and this insight can inform better LLM-based tools to identify and mitigate confusing code regions.

Abstract: Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language
models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks. Clearly, a
misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to
misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.
  A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the
same kind of code. This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in
software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of
LLMs.
  To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human
programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. We operationalized
comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers
using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related
potentials).
  We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and
amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This
result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.
Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to
identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human
programmers.

### [308] [LaQual: A Novel Framework for Automated Evaluation of LLM App Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18636)
*Yan Wang,Xinyi Hou,Yanjie Zhao,Weiguo Lin,Haoyu Wang,Junjun Si*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces LaQual, a framework for evaluating and recommending high-quality LLM apps in app stores by employing a combination of static and dynamic metrics. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in aligning with human judgment and improving user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM app stores lack efficient systems for ranking and recommending apps, relying mostly on static metrics that do not help users identify high-quality apps.

Method: The authors present LaQual, a framework that evaluates app quality in three stages: hierarchical app classification, filtering via static indicators, and scenario-adaptive dynamic evaluation leveraging LLM-generated metrics and scoring.

Result: LaQual's performance correlates well with human judgment (rho=0.62 for legal consulting, rho=0.60 for travel planning) and reduces candidate app pools by up to 81.3%. It also improves user decision confidence and evaluation efficiency in user studies.

Conclusion: LaQual provides a scalable, user-centered, and objective solution to improve app discovery in LLM app stores, outperforming baseline systems in multiple assessment areas.

Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of
intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content
creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for
ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics
like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently
find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an
automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of
three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'ReDeFo,' a multi-agent framework that integrates formal methods and LLM-enhanced agents to enable high-quality, reliable, and requirement-aligned code generation by addressing gaps in current LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing LLM-based code generation methods, which often lack systematic requirement development and modeling, and fail to achieve reliable, high-quality code that meets practical needs.

Method: The authors propose the ReDeFo framework, which uses three agents augmented with formal methods to transform natural language requirements into formal specifications and quality-assured executable code. The framework leverages formal methods to enable meticulous validation and reasoning.

Result: ReDeFo strengthens quality assurance in the code generation process, facilitating deeper correctness validation, bug detection, and enforcement of critical properties using formal specifications.

Conclusion: The proposed ReDeFo framework marks a step forward in creating reliable and auto-generated software by combining multi-agent systems, formal methods, and LLM advancements, thereby addressing ambiguities and improving requirement alignment.

Abstract: Automated code generation has long been considered the holy grail of software
engineering. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a
revolutionary breakthrough in this area. However, existing methods that only
rely on LLMs remain inadequate in the quality of generated code, offering no
guarantees of satisfying practical requirements. They lack a systematic
strategy for requirements development and modeling. Recently, LLM-based agents
typically possess powerful abilities and play an essential role in facilitating
the alignment of LLM outputs with user requirements. In this paper, we envision
the first multi-agent framework for reliable code generation based on
\textsc{re}quirements \textsc{de}velopment and \textsc{fo}rmalization, named
\textsc{ReDeFo}. This framework incorporates three agents, highlighting their
augmentation with knowledge and techniques of formal methods, into the
requirements-to-code generation pipeline to strengthen quality assurance. The
core of \textsc{ReDeFo} is the use of formal specifications to bridge the gap
between potentially ambiguous natural language requirements and precise
executable code. \textsc{ReDeFo} enables rigorous reasoning about correctness,
uncovering hidden bugs, and enforcing critical properties throughout the
development process. In general, our framework aims to take a promising step
toward realizing the long-standing vision of reliable, auto-generated software.

### [310] [LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721)
*Yunrui Pei,Hongshu Wang,Wenjie Zhang,Yun Lin,Weiyu Kong,Jin song Dong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RecovSlicing is a debugging tool that uses partial instrumentation and LLMs to determine dynamic data dependencies in software, achieving higher accuracy and recall than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why a variable holds a specific value (dynamic data dependency) is crucial for debugging, yet traditional methods involve high execution or instrumentation costs, especially in cases of non-deterministic programs or library-defined variables.

Method: RecovSlicing employs partial instrumentation and leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer program behavior and recover missing execution details, aligning variables with recorded memory to determine their definitions.

Result: The method achieves accuracy rates of 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3%—surpassing existing tools while also improving recall metrics. When applied to a regression bug localizer, RecovSlicing identifies 16% more regressions.

Conclusion: RecovSlicing provides an efficient alternative for computing dynamic data dependencies, eliminating the need for exhaustive instrumentation or re-execution, and proving its utility in enhancing debugging tools.

Abstract: Dynamic data dependency, answering "why a variable has this value?", is
critical for debugging. Given a program step `s` reading a variable `v`,
finding the dynamic definition of `v` is challenging. Traditional methods
require either (1) exhaustive instrumentation of all possible definitions of
`v` in one run or (2) replicating the run to re-examine reads/writes - both
costly. If `v` is defined in a library, instrumentation becomes expensive; for
non-deterministic programs, replication is infeasible.
  We propose RecovSlicing, which computes dynamic data dependency in a single
run with partial instrumentation. We leverage LLMs to infer program behavior
from a partially recorded trace and code context. Given a trace and a slicing
criterion (step `s` and variable `v`), RecovSlicing estimates the runtime
definition of `v` by recovering the missing execution.It also supports implicit
variables, such as those in `list.get(i)`. Technically, RecovSlicing tackles:
(1) recovering runtime values and structures, and (2) aligning recovered
variables with recorded memory to analyze definitions.
  We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8,300 data dependencies across three slicing
benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution
Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves accuracy of 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3%,
outperforming the best baseline (39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%), and also leads in recall
(91.1%, 91.1%, 98.3% vs. 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a regression bug
localizer, it enables finding 16% more regressions.

*Kexin Sun,Hongyu Kuang,Sebastian Baltes,Xin Zhou,He Zhang,Xiaoxing Ma,Guoping Rong,Dong Shao,Christoph Treude*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper assesses the adoption, effectiveness, and influencing factors of AI-based code review tools on GitHub repositories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the impact and effectiveness of AI-based tools in improving code quality through comments on pull requests.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical analysis on review comments from 16 AI-based code review tools, using a two-stage LLM-assisted framework and interpretable machine learning.

Result: While adoption of these tools is growing, the effectiveness is highly variable, with concise comments and those containing code snippets being more likely to provoke code changes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for better tool design and provides insights on improving AI-based code review systems through targeted strategies.

Abstract: AI-based code review tools automatically review and comment on pull requests
to improve code quality. Despite their growing presence, little is known about
their actual impact. We present a large-scale empirical study of 16 popular
AI-based code review actions for GitHub workflows, analyzing more than 22,000
review comments in 178 repositories. We investigate (1) how these tools are
adopted and configured, (2) whether their comments lead to code changes, and
(3) which factors influence their effectiveness. We develop a two-stage
LLM-assisted framework to determine whether review comments are addressed, and
use interpretable machine learning to identify influencing factors. Our
findings show that, while adoption is growing, effectiveness varies widely.
Comments that are concise, contain code snippets, and are manually triggered,
particularly those from hunk-level review tools, are more likely to result in
code changes. These results highlight the importance of careful tool design and
suggest directions for improving AI-based code review systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper investigates how GitHub projects use SonarQube Cloud to enforce code quality and customization practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to uncover how open-source projects utilize and customize SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud, given their widespread adoption in ensuring code quality.

Method: A mining study was conducted on GitHub repositories integrated with SonarQube Cloud via GitHub Actions.

Result: Findings include that 81% of SonarQube Cloud projects are correctly linked to GitHub repositories, 75% use the default quality gate, and 45% customize their quality conditions according to specific goals.

Conclusion: Most projects rely on default configurations, but many also customize them for specific needs. The paper suggests further research into the link between quality gate setups and software outcomes for tailored recommendations.

Abstract: Background: Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools are widely adopted to enforce
code quality standards. However, little is known about how open-source projects
use and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub
projects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method:
We conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub
Actions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using
SonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud
projects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among
265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default
quality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to
pass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate
provided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with
different conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with
SonarQube Cloud's "Clean as You Code" principle and enforce security,
maintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or
modified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined
configurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to
meet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a
future research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software
outcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable
evidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud
in various contexts.

### [313] [Interleaving Large Language Models for Compiler Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18955)
*Yunbo Ni,Shaohua Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes LegoFuzz, a compiler testing framework that uses AI-generated code pieces to efficiently test compilers, finding 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for compiler testing using AI models fail to generate sufficiently complex test programs and are computationally expensive.

Method: The framework divides the testing into offline and online phases; the offline phase generates feature-rich code pieces using LLMs, while the online phase combines these pieces to create complex test programs.

Result: Implemented LegoFuzz identified 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, with nearly half being serious miscompilation bugs.

Conclusion: LegoFuzz demonstrates an efficient way to enhance software testing using AI, showing potential applications beyond C compilers.

Abstract: Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs),
has shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key
problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple,
and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this
paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing
process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the
offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich
code pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically
combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then
used to test compilers.
  We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The
results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C
compilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious
and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We
believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in
software testing beyond just C compilers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GitTaskBench is introduced to evaluate code agents on real-world tasks using repositories. Tests reveal current systems struggle, achieving only 48.15% success on average. Key issues are environment setup and workflow management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in benchmarks for evaluating code agents in real-world, workflow-driven tasks using repositories like GitHub.

Method: A new benchmark, GitTaskBench, evaluates 54 tasks spanning 7 modalities and domains. It introduces economic performance metrics (alpha-value) and uses real repositories with human-curated success criteria.

Result: GitTaskBench reveals that even leading systems, such as OpenHands+Claude 3.7, can only complete 48.15% of tasks, with many failures stemming from fundamental issues.

Conclusion: GitTaskBench demonstrates the difficulty of repository-aware task execution by code agents. It highlights the need for better workflow and environment management to improve real-world utility.

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at
https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.

### [315] [A Slice-Based Change Impact Analysis for Regression Test Case Prioritization of Object-Oriented Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19056)
*S. Panda,D. Munjal,D. P. Mohapatra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study proposes a static method for optimizing the execution order of regression test cases by utilizing the concept of affected component coupling (ACC) in object-oriented programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To save time and cost in retesting by prioritizing test cases that detect faults earlier, especially in fault-prone components of software.

Method: Static analysis is used to compute the ACC values of affected program parts represented as nodes in an affected slice graph (ASG), prioritizing test cases that cover nodes with higher ACC.

Result: Mutation fault analyses and seven case studies showed that the proposed method reveals faults earlier and performs comparably to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed ACC-based static prioritization approach is feasible and performs acceptably while improving early fault detection.

Abstract: Test case prioritization focuses on finding a suitable order of execution of
the test cases in a test suite to meet some performance goals like detecting
faults early. It is likely that some test cases execute the program parts that
are more prone to errors and will detect more errors if executed early during
the testing process. Finding an optimal order of execution for the selected
regression test cases saves time and cost of retesting. This paper presents a
static approach to prioritizing the test cases by computing the affected
component coupling (ACC) of the affected parts of object-oriented programs. We
construct a graph named affected slice graph (ASG) to represent these affected
program parts.We determine the fault-proneness of the nodes of ASG by computing
their respective ACC values. We assign higher priority to those test cases that
cover the nodes with higher ACC values. Our analysis with mutation faults shows
that the test cases executing the fault-prone program parts have a higher
chance to reveal faults earlier than other test cases in the test suite. The
result obtained from seven case studies justifies that our approach is feasible
and gives acceptable performance in comparison to some existing techniques.

*Alex Szorkovszky,Rujeena Mathema,Pedro Lencastre,Pedro Lind,Anis Yazidi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper identifies a memory-dependent phenomenon, "self-crossing avoidance," during visual search in "Where's Waldo?" that impacts saccade behavior and varies between individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the underlying mechanisms of scan path history and its effect on visual exploration.

Method: The authors used the step-selection framework and compared participant data to synthetic data generated with a memoryless model. They employed mixed-effect regressions and parametric probabilistic modeling.

Result: Self-crossing avoidance was observed; it depended on scan path history (last ~7 seconds) and varied across individuals. Strategic differences were consistent and correlated with shorter saccade lengths and fixation durations.

Conclusion: Self-crossing avoidance enhances visual exploration by complementing inhibition of return, indicating a locally focused orienting strategy.

Abstract: Although visual search appears largely random, several oculomotor biases
exist such that the likelihoods of saccade directions and lengths depend on the
previous scan path. Compared to the most recent fixations, the impact of the
longer path history is more difficult to quantify. Using the step-selection
framework commonly used in movement ecology, and analyzing data from 45-second
viewings of "Where's Waldo"?, we report a new memory-dependent effect that also
varies significantly between individuals, which we term self-crossing
avoidance. This is a tendency for saccades to avoid crossing those earlier in
the scan path, and is most evident when both have small amplitudes. We show
this by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless
approximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model
with a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time). Maximum likelihood
fitting indicates that this effect is strongest when including the last
$\approx 7$ seconds of a scan path. The effect size is comparable to well-known
forms of history dependence such as inhibition of return. A parametric
probabilistic model including a self-crossing penalty term was able to
reproduce joint statistics of saccade lengths and self-crossings. We also
quantified individual strategic differences, and their consistency over the six
images viewed per participant, using mixed-effect regressions. Participants
with a higher tendency to avoid crossings displayed smaller saccade lengths and
shorter fixation durations on average, but did not display more horizontal,
vertical, forward or reverse saccades. Together, these results indicate that
the avoidance of crossings is a local orienting strategy that facilitates and
complements inhibition of return, and hence exploration of visual scenes.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new, cost-effective, large-scale EEG dataset with over 1.6 million visual trials, highlighting its feasibility for brain-computer interface research using consumer-grade hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the accessibility of large-scale EEG datasets and examine the practicality of affordable systems in brain-computer interface and visual cognition research.

Method: The dataset was collected using a 32-channel consumer-grade EEG system, with analyses demonstrating semantic decoding, EEG-to-Image reconstruction, and log-linear performance scaling with data volume.

Result: The research shows that EEG analysis and semantic decoding are feasible using affordable equipment, maintaining effective performance even with lower signal-to-noise ratios.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential for democratizing EEG research using accessible equipment, promoting cost-effective exploration of deep neural models in visual cognition.

Abstract: We present a new large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) dataset as part of
the THINGS initiative, comprising over 1.6 million visual stimulus trials
collected from 20 participants, and totaling more than twice the size of the
most popular current benchmark dataset, THINGS-EEG2. Crucially, our data was
recorded using a 32-channel consumer-grade wet electrode system costing ~$2.2k,
around 27x cheaper than research-grade EEG systems typically used in cognitive
neuroscience labs. Our work is one of the first open-source, large-scale EEG
resource designed to closely reflect the quality of hardware that is practical
to deploy in real-world, downstream applications of brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs). We aim to explore the specific question of whether deep neural
network-based BCI research and semantic decoding methods can be effectively
conducted with such affordable systems, filling an important gap in current
literature that is extremely relevant for future research. In our analysis, we
not only demonstrate that decoding of high-level semantic information from EEG
of visualized images is possible at consumer-grade hardware, but also that our
data can facilitate effective EEG-to-Image reconstruction even despite
significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to traditional
benchmarks, we also conduct analyses of EEG-to-Image models that demonstrate
log-linear decoding performance with increasing data volume on our data, and
discuss the trade-offs between hardware cost, signal fidelity, and the scale of
data collection efforts in increasing the size and utility of currently
available datasets. Our contributions aim to pave the way for large-scale,
cost-effective EEG research with widely accessible equipment, and position our
dataset as a unique resource for the democratization and development of
effective deep neural models of visual cognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining Transfer Entropy (TE) and directed Persistent Homology (PH) to study information flow in spiking neural systems with high-dimensional topological insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper understanding of information flow and topological complexity in spiking neural systems by analyzing dynamics and connectivity patterns beyond simple pairwise interactions.

Method: The authors integrate Transfer Entropy to measure directional neuron influence and Persistent Homology to assess topological structures in weighted, directed graphs generated based on dynamics. The pipeline is tested on various datasets including synthetic networks, image-classification networks, and mouse cortical recordings.

Result: The framework successfully distinguishes task complexities, input structures, and behavioral dynamics through topological signatures. Complex or noisy conditions emphasize higher-dimensional features representing intricate interaction patterns.

Conclusion: This generalizable and interpretable approach provides a principled way to explore global organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems, especially suitable for time-resolved binary spiking data.

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Deterministic Uniform-Weight Trimming (ADUWT) for deterministic coreset construction in empirical risk minimization, achieving $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative-error approximations with thorough analysis and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of a rigorous framework for deterministic coreset construction in empirical risk minimization (ERM), which is crucial for efficient and accurate computation over large datasets.

Method: They introduce the ADUWT algorithm, utilizing sensitivity bounds to trim data points and applying a uniform weight for coreset creation. Detailed analysis is performed using sensitivity heterogeneity metrics and minimax characterizations.

Result: The approach demonstrates instance-specific size optimization, tractable sensitivity oracles for various regression and classification models, and empirical results that confirm theoretical findings. Precise pseudocode is provided for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The research establishes deterministic coresets as a viable solution for efficient ERM computation, raises questions on optimal oracles, streaming solutions, and fairness constraints.

Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for deterministic coreset construction in
empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our central contribution is the Adaptive
Deterministic Uniform-Weight Trimming (ADUWT) algorithm, which constructs a
coreset by excising points with the lowest sensitivity bounds and applying a
data-dependent uniform weight to the remainder. The method yields a uniform
$(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative-error approximation for the ERM objective over the
entire hypothesis space. We provide complete analysis, including (i) a minimax
characterization proving the optimality of the adaptive weight, (ii) an
instance-dependent size analysis in terms of a \emph{Sensitivity Heterogeneity
Index}, and (iii) tractable sensitivity oracles for kernel ridge regression,
regularized logistic regression, and linear SVM. Reproducibility is supported
by precise pseudocode for the algorithm, sensitivity oracles, and evaluation
pipeline. Empirical results align with the theory. We conclude with open
problems on instance-optimal oracles, deterministic streaming, and
fairness-constrained ERM.

*Jongyeong Lee,Junya Honda,Shinji Ito,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policies using asymmetric unbounded perturbations, extending previous works and presenting challenges in multi-armed bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend analytical foundations of FTPL, which lag behind FTRL in achieving BOBW results, and to explore the nuances of specific perturbation types in both two-armed and general multi-armed bandit settings.

Method: The study leverages unbounded asymmetric Fréchet-type perturbations, including hybrid types, to analyze BOBW results, and also investigates the connection between Tsallis entropy and Fréchet-type perturbations.

Result: The paper provides BOBW guarantees for symmetric unbounded perturbations in two-armed bandits but highlights challenges and limitations when extending this to general multi-armed bandits.

Conclusion: New insights are offered into FTPL policy design, but the challenges in broad application underline the need for further research to fully understand FTPL behavior.

Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policies have achieved
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results in various settings through hybrid
regularizers, whereas analogous results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)
remain limited due to inherent analytical challenges. To advance the analytical
foundations of FTPL, we revisit classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded
perturbations and establish BOBW results for FTPL under a broad family of
asymmetric unbounded Fr\'echet-type perturbations, including hybrid
perturbations combining Gumbel-type and Fr\'echet-type tails. These results not
only extend the BOBW results of FTPL but also offer new insights into designing
alternative FTPL policies competitive with hybrid regularization approaches.
Motivated by earlier observations in two-armed bandits, we further investigate
the connection between the $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and a Fr\'echet-type
perturbation. Our numerical observations suggest that it corresponds to a
symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbation, and based on this, we establish the
first BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in the two-armed
setting. In contrast, in general multi-armed bandits, we find an instance in
which symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbations violate the key condition for
standard BOBW analysis, which is a problem not observed with asymmetric or
nonnegative Fr\'echet-type perturbations. Although this example does not rule
out alternative analyses achieving BOBW results, it suggests the limitations of
directly applying the relationship observed in two-armed cases to the general
case and thus emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand
the behavior of FTPL in broader settings.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents the first algorithm for contextual combinatorial semi-bandits with best-of-both-worlds regret bounds in adversarial and corrupted stochastic environments, while also speeding up computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current algorithms which fail to provide optimized performance across both adversarial and corrupted stochastic settings, and to improve practical runtime efficiency for large-scale implementations.

Method: The authors use an FTRL framework with a Shannon entropy regularizer, coupled with a novel transformation of high-dimensional projection problems into single-variable root-finding problems for computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed algorithm delivers $
abla{T}$ regret bounds in adversarial settings and $
abla{ln T}$ in stochastic ones while demonstrating improved computational speed during empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: The algorithm achieves theoretical guarantees in regret minimization across different regimes and demonstrates practical scalability, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for contextual
combinatorial semi-bandits that simultaneously guarantees
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial regime and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\ln T)$ regret in the corrupted stochastic regime. Our
approach builds on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework equipped
with a Shannon entropy regularizer, yielding a flexible method that admits
efficient implementations. Beyond regret bounds, we tackle the practical
bottleneck in FTRL (or, equivalently, Online Stochastic Mirror Descent) arising
from the high-dimensional projection step encountered in each round of
interaction. By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we transform the
$K$-dimensional convex projection problem into a single-variable root-finding
problem, dramatically accelerating each round. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that this combined strategy not only attains the attractive regret
bounds of best-of-both-worlds algorithms but also delivers substantial
per-round speed-ups, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-time
applications.

*Peter Naylor,Benjamin Poignard,Héctor Climente-González,Makoto Yamada*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces SmRMR, a feature screening method combining feature-feature and feature-target relationships, using penalized mRMR and a knockoff filter for accurate inactive feature identification and FDR control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature screening by integrating feature-feature and feature-target relationships while ensuring inactive feature recovery and FDR control.

Method: A penalized mRMR procedure with a non-convex regularizer is combined with a multi-stage knockoff filter approach.

Result: SmRMR effectively identifies inactive features, controls FDR, and performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO, requiring only an FDR threshold.

Conclusion: SmRMR is efficient and conservative in feature selection, illustrated through simulations and real datasets, with code available online.

Abstract: We propose a feature screening method that integrates both feature-feature
and feature-target relationships. Inactive features are identified via a
penalized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, which is the
continuous version of the classic mRMR penalized by a non-convex regularizer,
and where the parameters estimated as zero coefficients represent the set of
inactive features. We establish the conditions under which zero coefficients
are correctly identified to guarantee accurate recovery of inactive features.
We introduce a multi-stage procedure based on the knockoff filter enabling the
penalized mRMR to discard inactive features while controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR). Our method performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO but is more
conservative in the number of selected features. It only requires setting an
FDR threshold, rather than specifying the number of features to retain. The
effectiveness of the method is illustrated through simulations and real-world
datasets. The code to reproduce this work is available on the following GitHub:

*Juan-Pablo Ortega,Florian Rossmannek*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper seeks to unify different concepts of memory in RNNs, clarify their interrelations, and derive new implications to enhance understanding of temporal data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory in RNNs is fundamental to their temporal data processing capabilities, but existing concepts like fading memory, echo states, and input forgetting are often used interchangeably without clear connections.

Method: The study uses a theoretical approach to establish a common framework, derive new implications, and provide alternative proofs for existing notions of memory in RNNs.

Result: The research unifies various notions of memory in RNNs, establishes equivalences and implications between them, and offers enriched theoretical insights.

Conclusion: By consolidating the notions of memory in RNNs, the study enhances the understanding of their ability to handle temporal information and provides a solid theoretical foundation for further exploration.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in
information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A
fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output
responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the
information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize
the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state
forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are
often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This
work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications
and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing
results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research
contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information
processing capabilities.

### [324] [Controllable Single-shot Animation Blending with Temporal Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18525)
*Eleni Tselepi,Spyridon Thermos,Gerasimos Potamianos*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for seamlessly blending two or more skeletal motions in a single generative pass using temporal conditioning and skeleton-aware normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-shot generative models lack explicit mechanisms to controllably blend motions during generation, which is important for animators seeking efficiency and realism.

Method: The proposed method applies skeleton-aware normalization and temporal conditioning to ensure smooth transitions and controllability between blended motions.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the approach delivers plausible, smooth, and controllable motion blends across various animation styles and kinematic skeletons.

Conclusion: The framework successfully creates seamless, efficient, and controllable motion blending, filling a gap in single-shot generative modeling for animation.

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

*Xiaohao Sun,Divyam Goel,Angle X. Chang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemLayoutDiff, a model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor scenes conditioned on room layouts and architectural constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create a 3D indoor scene synthesis model that respects architectural constraints, ensuring realistic designs.

Method: SemLayoutDiff uses a categorical diffusion model to generate semantic maps and employs a cross-attention network to place furniture based on these layouts.

Result: The method produces realistic and varied room designs that respect architectural constraints, outperforming prior techniques on the 3D-FRONT dataset.

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff is a significant improvement in 3D scene synthesis, ensuring spatial coherence and practicality in generated designs.

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

### [326] [PanoHair: Detailed Hair Strand Synthesis on Volumetric Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18944)
*Shashikant Verma,Shanmuganathan Raman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PanoHair is a novel model for generating realistic digital hair strands efficiently, avoiding the need for complex multi-view image setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the inefficiencies in current methods of high-fidelity hair strand synthesis for digital humans, which rely on complex setups and slow processing times.

Method: The method involves using PanoHair to estimate head geometry via signed distance fields and a generative model, enabling latent space manipulation for diverse hairstyles and rapid 3D hair strand synthesis.

Result: PanoHair achieves realistic hair strand generation in under 5 seconds, creating clean manifold meshes and outperforming existing methods in terms of efficiency and visual results.

Conclusion: PanoHair provides an efficient generative approach that simplifies high-fidelity hair synthesis, making it suitable for real-world applications without requiring intricate studio setups.

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

*Florian Hahlbohm,Linus Franke,Leon Overkämping,Paula Wespe,Susana Castillo,Martin Eisemann,Marcus Magnor*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces optimizations to the Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) framework to enhance training and rendering speed, reduce VRAM usage, and improve image quality slightly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the slow rendering and training limitations of INPC, a hybrid representation that achieves high-quality novel view synthesis but is inefficient for practical use.

Method: The authors implemented an improved rasterizer, better sampling techniques, pre-training for hole-filling CNN, and used Gaussian modeling for points during inference to enhance performance and visual quality.

Result: The optimized pipeline achieves up to 25% faster training, twice the rendering speed, 20% reduction in VRAM usage, and slight improvements in image quality.

Conclusion: These optimizations significantly boost practicality and efficiency without compromising the visual fidelity of INPC, and the approaches are applicable beyond this framework.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hotword customization system using a new module (H-PRM) to improve recognition accuracy through acoustic similarity and integration with traditional models and Audio LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of reduced recognition accuracy for large-scale hotwords in ASR systems, especially in the context of domain-specific terms.

Method: The system uses a hotword pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to measure acoustic similarity between hotwords and speech segments for identifying relevant candidates, integrating with traditional ASR models and Audio LLMs.

Result: H-PRM enhances post-recall rate (PRR) in traditional models and successfully supports hotword customization in Audio LLMs. Testing demonstrates that it outperforms existing techniques.

Conclusion: H-PRM shows potential as an effective plug-and-play module for hotword customization in ASR, opening new avenues for improving domain-specific recognition tasks.

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate
(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a
prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

*Lars Nieradzik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SwiftF0 is a compact and efficient neural model for monophonic pitch estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in noisy conditions and delivering robust results across acoustic domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of real-time and accurate pitch estimation in noisy environments, particularly on devices with limited computational resources.

Method: SwiftF0 is trained using diverse datasets, extensive data augmentation, and makes use of synthetic speech data (SpeechSynth) for robust training. A unified metric for pitch evaluation is also proposed.

Result: SwiftF0 achieves superior performance (91.80% harmonic mean at 10 dB SNR), outperforms benchmarks like CREPE, and delivers efficiency with just 95,842 parameters and 42x faster CPU execution.

Conclusion: SwiftF0 pushes the boundaries of pitch estimation with a highly efficient model design, a robust benchmark framework, and synthetic data for precise performance evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in
audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model
that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through
training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data
augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains
while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic
mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12
percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0
requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on
CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the
critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which
typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce
\emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level
TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more
robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric,
combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable
pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo
of SwiftF0 is available at https://swift-f0.github.io/, the source code at

*Qing Xiao,Yingshan Peng,PeiPei Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates multi-speaker fine-tuning for dysarthric speech recognition, demonstrating improvements in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of recognizing dysarthric speech caused by variability and differences from normal speech.

Method: The research explores using multi-speaker fine-tuning on ASR models instead of individual tuning for each patient.

Result: Multi-speaker fine-tuning showed improved recognition accuracy (up to 13.15% lower WER) and reduced data dependency.

Conclusion: Training on multiple speakers enhances model generalization, mitigates overfitting, and benefits dysarthric speech recognition.

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and
disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually
fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent
feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker
fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves
recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances
generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates
speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves
target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus
single-speaker fine-tuning.

*Ridwan Arefeen,Xiaoxiao Miao,Rong Tong,Aik Beng Ng,Simon See*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces SegReConcat, a method that enhances attackers' ability to de-anonymize speakers in anonymized speech data by rearranging and combining word-level speech segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks in anonymized voice, where residual speaker traits persist, potentially exposing speaker identities.

Method: SegReConcat involves segmenting anonymized speech at the word level, rearranging these segments, and mixing them into the original utterance to disrupt long-term contextual cues.

Result: SegReConcat was tested in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024, showing improved de-anonymization capabilities in five out of seven anonymization systems.

Conclusion: SegReConcat highlights vulnerabilities in current anonymization systems and provides a new method to study and strengthen speaker privacy techniques.

Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while
maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often
persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation
method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems.
SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments
using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual
cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker
to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method
has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across
seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out
of seven systems.

### [332] [Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665)
*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Min-Chun Chen,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines privacy concerns in LLM-based recommender systems and proposes four membership inference attacks (MIAs) to assess potential threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and address the potential privacy risks in LLM-based recommender systems, particularly through in-context learning that uses sensitive user interaction data.

Method: Designed and evaluated four novel MIAs: direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks, leveraging unique properties of LLMs. Tests were conducted on three LLMs and two RecSys benchmark datasets.

Result: Findings demonstrate that MIAs pose a realistic threat to LLM-based RecSys, with direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing strong attack advantages. Various factors, such as shot count and victim position in prompts, significantly affect the attacks.

Conclusion: LLM RecSys presents new privacy risks; therefore, robust defense mechanisms are essential to mitigate realistic threats highlighted in this study.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

*Jan Malte Lichtenberg,Antonio De Candia,Matteo Ruffini*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DenseRec is introduced as a dual-path embedding approach that alleviates the item cold-start problem in transformer-based sequential recommenders by projecting dense content embeddings into ID spaces, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitations of traditional item ID embedding methods in sequential recommendation systems, especially for dynamic item catalogs and unseen items.

Method: DenseRec employs a dual-path embedding architecture with a linear projection of dense embeddings into ID embedding spaces during training, facilitating adaptation to unseen items without additional infrastructure.

Result: DenseRec showed superior performance compared to ID-only SASRec in experiments across three real-world datasets, achieving better sequence representation for unseen items.

Conclusion: DenseRec offers a practical and effective solution to the item cold-start problem, enhancing sequence representation and outperforming traditional approaches without the need for complex modifications.

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec,
typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to
the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item
catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer
potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has
consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this
integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that
introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection
from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,
enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring
specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three
real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only
SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using
compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise
from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,
positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start
sequential recommendation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a two-stage training strategy for ID-based embeddings in recommendation systems to address overfitting challenges, showing improved online generalization and engagement gains in live deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the 'one-epoch problem' caused by overfitting in ID-based embeddings, especially due to long-tail data distributions in recommendation systems.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage training strategy: (1) a pre-training phase using a minimal model with contrastive loss to achieve broader data coverage, and (2) fine-tuning embeddings for downstream tasks.

Result: Offline experiments reveal that multi-epoch pre-training mitigates overfitting, while online tests at Pinterest confirm significant engagement improvements.

Conclusion: The two-stage training system enhances ID-based embedding performance in complex recommendation tasks without overfitting, with validated results from live deployment.

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation
systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the
long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single
epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven
research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing
convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel
two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a
minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the
embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training
during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting
embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex
downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live
traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a game-theoretic method to compress latent spaces for transformer-based vector search, improving efficiency and semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vector similarity search is challenged by high-dimensional embeddings, necessitating methods to balance scalability and semantic utility.

Method: A zero-sum game framework is modeled to optimize latent-space compression between retrieval accuracy and storage efficiency, deriving transformations that retain semantic similarity.

Result: Achieved higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873 vs. 0.5194) compared to FAISS, with a small trade-off in query time.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic latent compression enhances semantic accuracy and efficiency, making it compatible with existing LLM pipelines for better search performance.

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval
systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the
scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high
dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel
game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance
both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the
compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage
efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic
similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a
widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a
significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873
vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off
highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in
high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be
seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically
accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges and a preliminary approach to personalizing yoga based on an individual's unique needs, using multidisciplinary computing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulties of tailoring yoga practices to individual needs, abilities, objectives, and changing health conditions.

Method: The method involves sketching a preliminary approach for yoga personalization, incorporating pose sensing, recommendation systems, and decision support tools illustrated with a Surya Namaskar case study.

Result: The paper identifies decision support challenges in yoga personalization and proposes a framework leveraging computing techniques.

Conclusion: This is a pioneering effort to tackle yoga personalization using multidisciplinary computing, emphasizing decision-support systems and individual adaptability.

Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and
meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced
worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are
a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or
breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits
of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover
their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies,
(b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities
and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items
based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this
vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem.
Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an
outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques
from a multidisciplinary computing perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first paper that comprehensively examines decision support issues
around Yoga personalization, from pose sensing to recommendation of corrections
for a complete regimen, and illustrates with a case study of Surya Namaskar --
a set of 12 choreographed poses.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of calibration and behavioral economics-inspired corrections on trust and human decision alignment with machine learning predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how calibration of ML models impacts trust and decision-making by users, particularly non-expert humans.

Method: Conducted HCI experiments to analyze trust levels and decision-prediction correlations, and introduced prospect theory-based corrections to calibrated scores.

Result: Calibration alone is insufficient; prospect theory adjustments are essential for improving alignment between user decisions and model predictions.

Conclusion: Prospect theory corrections play a crucial role in better aligning human decisions with model predictions, but do not inherently change perceived trust levels.

Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and
adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this
proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made
by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a
Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of
calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between
decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported
calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from
behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and
decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the
prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between
human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation
suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model
more?" are unaffected by the method used.

### [339] [Impact of Target and Tool Visualization on Depth Perception and Usability in Optical See-Through AR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18481)
*Yue Yang,Xue Xie,Xinkai Wang,Hui Zhang,Chiming Yu,Xiaoxian Xiong,Lifeng Zhu,Yuanyi Zheng,Jue Cen,Bruce Daniel,Fred Baik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper explores ways to improve depth perception and usability in optical see-through augmented reality systems like HoloLens 2 through experiments involving target transparency and tool visualization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in depth perception and the occlusion of real instruments in optical see-through augmented reality systems, which are vital for tasks like surgical guidance.

Method: Two experiments were conducted with 10 participants using HoloLens 2. Experiment 1 focused on comparing high and low target transparencies in a depth matching task. Experiment 2 examined the impact of six visualization conditions (two transparencies and three tool visualization modes) on a simulated surgical pinpoint task.

Result: The study found that opaque targets significantly reduced depth estimation errors, and visualizing the real tool improved accuracy, usability, and reduced workload compared to tool holograms or no tool tracking.

Conclusion: Correct occlusion cues and rendering virtual content opaque while showing real tools are essential for improving depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers should focus on robust tool tracking and carefully use transparency to balance depth perception and tool visibility.

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

### [340] [Beyond prior knowledge: The predictive role of knowledge-building in Tutor Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18545)
*Tasmia Shahriar,Mia Ameen,Aditi Mallavarapu,Shiyan Jiang,Noboru Matsuda*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Students learning through teaching tend to favor superficial knowledge-telling. This study finds that engaging in knowledge-building, facilitated by teachable agents with persistent questions, fosters effective learning and bridges gaps between low prior knowledge and higher learning gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how knowledge-building activities impact the bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning in students adopting teaching roles.

Method: The study analyzed student engagement in teaching scenarios, emphasizing the interaction of procedural and conceptual learning when coupled with teachable agents.

Result: Findings showed that engaging in knowledge-building activities led to higher post-test scores, regardless of initial procedural and conceptual knowledge levels.

Conclusion: Knowledge-building activities are essential for bridging the learning gap and fostering stronger gains in both procedural and conceptual knowledge.

Abstract: When adopting the role of a teacher in learning-by-teaching environments,
students often struggle to engage in knowledge-building activities, such as
providing explanations and addressing misconceptions. Instead, they frequently
default to knowledge-telling behaviors, where they simply dictate what they
already know or what to do without deeper reflection, thereby limiting
learning. Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent
follow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift
from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor
learning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and
procedural knowledge. Research has established a bidirectional relationship
between these knowledge types, where improvements in one reinforce the other.
This study investigates the role of knowledge-building in mediating the
bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning. Our
findings revealed a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and
conceptual knowledge, with higher post-test scores observed among students who
engaged in knowledge-building, regardless of their procedural and conceptual
pre-test performance. This suggests that knowledge-building serves as a crucial
mechanism bridging the gap between students with low prior knowledge and higher
conceptual and procedural learning gain.

### [341] [Long-Term Variability in Physiological-Arousal Relationships for Robust Emotion Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18782)
*Hiroto Sakimura,Takayuki Nagaya,Tomoki Nishi,Tetsuo Kurahashi,Katsunori Kohda,Nobuhiko Muramoto*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores the stability of physiological-emotion relationships over several months using physiological data and self-reports, revealing variations over time and emphasizing the need for periodic updates in emotion estimation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the largely unexamined assumption that the relationship between physiological features and subjective affect remains stable over long-term periods.

Method: The researchers collected physiological signals (e.g., EDA, heart rate) and self-reported emotional states from 24 participants in natural working environments over two three-month periods. They used Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) for interpretability and analyzed temporal changes in these relationships.

Result: A 5% accuracy drop was observed when models trained on first-period data were used to predict second-period data. Heart rate proved relatively stable, but EDA signals showed significant variability over time.

Conclusion: Physiological-emotion relationships exhibit temporal variability, suggesting the need for periodic model updates (e.g., every five months) to maintain accuracy in emotion estimation systems.

Abstract: Estimating emotional states from physiological signals is a central topic in
affective computing and psychophysiology. While many emotion estimation systems
implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and
subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes.
This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across
several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and
constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals --
including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature,
and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24
participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic
working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between
physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined
how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable
Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on
1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period
data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations.
EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a
relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level
fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited,
these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in
physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models
should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed
shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.

TL;DR: This paper discusses innovative user interface concepts for Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing more flexible and user-focused designs based on insights from a design workshop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of rigid and linear user interfaces of LLMs, which hinder their full potential in providing versatile user interactions.

Method: The paper employs insights from a design thinking workshop with participants identifying use cases, evaluating current interface limitations, and creating new interaction concepts. This process is supplemented by a human-centered design methodology.

Result: The workshop generated ideas like flexible context management, dynamic conversation branching, and better user control mechanisms, contributing to the development of an improved whiteboard-based UI.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating for user-centered design principles to shape future LLM interface improvements, emphasizing ongoing iteration and user feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models have become widely adopted tools due to their versatile
capabilities, yet their user interfaces remain limited, often following rigid,
linear interaction paradigms. In this paper, we present insights from a design
thinking workshop held at the deRSE25 conference aiming at collaboratively
developing innovative user interface concepts for LLMs. During the workshop,
participants identified common use cases, evaluated the strengths and
shortcomings of current LLM interfaces, and created visualizations of new
interaction concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic
conversation branching, and enhanced mechanisms for user control. We describe
how these participant-generated ideas advanced our own whiteboard-based UI
approach. The ongoing development of this interface is guided by the
human-centered design process - an iterative, user-focused methodology that
emphasizes continuous refinement through user feedback. Broader implications
for future LLM interface development are discussed, advocating for increased
attention to UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles.

*Yusi Wei,Hande Y. Benson,Muge Capan*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper examines anonymization methods to balance privacy and utility in sharing healthcare data for machine learning tasks and identifies vulnerable sub-populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address privacy concerns while preserving the utility of healthcare data for secondary use, benefiting research and clinical innovation.

Method: Three anonymization methods ($k$-anonymity, methods by Zheng et al., and MO-OBAM) are evaluated on their ability to reduce re-identification risks while maintaining machine learning model performance using a dataset of hospitalized adult patients.

Result: MO-OBAM offers the best balance, showing only a 2% change in ML precision and recall, while $k$-anonymity provides limited protection, and Zheng et al.'s methods have stronger safeguards.

Conclusion: MO-OBAM is recommended for anonymizing healthcare data to safeguard vulnerable populations without significantly sacrificing data utility for machine learning models.

Abstract: The secondary use of healthcare data is vital for research and clinical
innovation, but it raises concerns about patient privacy. This study
investigates how to balance privacy preservation and data utility in healthcare
data sharing, considering the perspectives of both data providers and data
users. Using a dataset of adult patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2015, we
predict whether sepsis was present at admission or developed during the
hospital stay. We identify sub-populations, such as older adults, frequently
hospitalized patients, and racial minorities, that are especially vulnerable to
privacy attacks due to their unique combinations of demographic and healthcare
utilization attributes. These groups are also critical for machine learning
(ML) model performance. We evaluate three anonymization methods-$k$-anonymity,
the technique by Zheng et al., and the MO-OBAM model-based on their ability to
reduce re-identification risk while maintaining ML utility. Results show that
$k$-anonymity offers limited protection. The methods of Zheng et al. and
MO-OBAM provide stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding the best
utility outcomes: only a 2% change in precision and recall compared to the
original dataset. This work provides actionable insights for healthcare
organizations on how to share data responsibly. It highlights the need for
anonymization methods that protect vulnerable populations without sacrificing
the performance of data-driven models.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper improves quasi-steady aerodynamic models using a data-driven approach, reducing prediction errors in insect flight simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to analyze unsteady aerodynamic forces in insect flight face a trade-off between accuracy and explanatory power.

Method: The authors identify and incorporate three critical mechanisms into quasi-steady aerodynamic models using a selection from 5,000 kinematic functions.

Result: Incorporating new mechanisms significantly reduced prediction errors in simulations of hawkmoth and fruit fly flight.

Conclusion: The data-driven quasi-steady model offers an efficient tool for studying insect flight and developing bio-inspired robots.

Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate
complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology,
physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs:
high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and
lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady
assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these
limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models,
we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of
previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000
candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three
key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise
kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been
qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these
mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model
using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in
hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at
low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid
aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding
evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying
robots.

*Lorenzo Beretta,Vincent Cohen-Addad,Rajesh Jayaram,Erik Waingarten*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper presents a reduction from Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to Closest Pair (CP), enhancing approximation algorithms for high-dimensional EMD problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for the paper is to improve the computational efficiency of approximation algorithms for Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which is widely used in high-dimensional data matching and analysis.

Method: The method involves a reduction from $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate EMD to $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate CP, along with a sublinear implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update framework to optimize computations.

Result: The paper achieves a new approximation algorithm for high-dimensional EMD with a faster runtime of $n^{2-\tilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^{1/3})}$, surpassing the prior runtime of $n^{2-\Omega(\varepsilon^2)}$.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that EMD problems can be effectively reduced to CP, offering improved algorithms with faster computation and showcasing the utility of geometric structure exploitation in optimization frameworks.

Abstract: We give a reduction from $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) to $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Closest Pair (CP). As a consequence, we
improve the fastest known approximation algorithm for high-dimensional EMD.
Here, given $p\in [1, 2]$ and two sets of $n$ points $X,Y \subseteq (\mathbb
R^d,\ell_p)$, their EMD is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between $X$
and $Y$, where the cost of matching two vectors is their $\ell_p$ distance.
Further, CP is the basic problem of finding a pair of points realizing $\min_{x
\in X, y\in Y} ||x-y||_p$. Our contribution is twofold: we show that if a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate CP can be computed in time $n^{2-\phi}$, then a
$1+O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to EMD can be computed in time
$n^{2-\Omega(\phi)}$; plugging in the fastest known algorithm for CP [Alman,
Chan, Williams FOCS'16], we obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for EMD running in time $n^{2-\tilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^{1/3})}$ for
high-dimensional point sets, which improves over the prior fastest running time
of $n^{2-\Omega(\varepsilon^2)}$ [Andoni, Zhang FOCS'23]. Our main technical
contribution is a sublinear implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update
framework for EMD. Specifically, we demonstrate that the updates can be
executed without ever explicitly computing or storing the weights; instead, we
exploit the underlying geometric structure to perform the updates implicitly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how 5GL can improve interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in imaging system design, especially where concurrent R&D workflows are prevalent.

Method: The paper uses the 96-Eyes project as a case study and provides real-world code examples to showcase how problem formulation in 5GL aligns diverse stakeholder needs.

Result: The use of 5GL enhances transparency, design traceability, and reduces misalignment across interdisciplinary teams, but faces practical barriers in adoption within environments dominated by 3GL.

Conclusion: 5GL offers significant benefits for complex system design but requires reshaping programming paradigms and workflows to overcome adoption challenges.

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,
5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system
design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a resource estimation framework for distributed quantum computing systems, showing feasibility despite increased resource demands compared to monolithic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum computing architectures struggle with scaling limitations, requiring an advanced approach to enable practical systems with hundreds to thousands of logical qubits.

Method: A novel resource estimation framework models distributed execution stacks, analyzing quantum algorithms under diverse configurations of qubit speeds, entanglement rates, and distillation protocols.

Result: Distributed architectures need approximately 1.4X more physical qubits and 4X higher execution time but offer promising implementation prospects under realistic hardware conditions.

Conclusion: Distributed systems provide a scalable solution for quantum computing despite additional resource demands, and the insights can guide future system designs in architecture and hardware.

Abstract: To enable practically useful quantum computing, we require hundreds to
thousands of logical qubits (collections of physical qubits with error
correction). Current monolithic device architectures have scaling limits beyond
few tens of logical qubits. To scale up, we require architectures that
orchestrate several monolithic devices into a distributed quantum computing
system. Currently, resource estimation, which is crucial for determining
hardware needs and bottlenecks, focuses exclusively on monolithic systems. Our
work fills this gap and answers key architectural design questions about
distributed systems, including the impact of distribution on application
resource needs, the organization of qubits across nodes and the requirements of
entanglement distillation (quantum network). To answer these questions, we
develop a novel resource estimation framework that models the key components of
the distributed execution stack. We analyse the performance of practical
quantum algorithms on various hardware configurations, spanning different qubit
speeds, entanglement generation rates and distillation protocols. We show that
distributed architectures have practically feasible resource requirements; for
a node size of 45K qubits, distributed systems need on average 1.4X higher
number of physical qubits and 4X higher execution time compared to monolithic
architectures, but with more favourable hardware implementation prospects. Our
insights on entanglement generation rates, node sizes and architecture have the
potential to inform system designs in the coming years.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Quantum Transformers face challenges due to deep parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) being vulnerable to quantum processing unit (QPU) noise.

Method: The VQT uses quantum approximation simulations, a vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, shot-efficient training, and gradient-free quantum circuit simulations.

Result: Competitive NLP task performances were demonstrated using IBM’s high-fidelity QPU and an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ platforms.

Conclusion: The VQT offers a noise-resistant quantum-friendly architecture suitable for efficient machine learning in quantum computing.

Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into

Motivation: To investigate whether quantum computing can be applied to generate fractal Julia sets with unique patterns, leveraging quantum principles like superposition, randomness, and entanglement.

Method: The study involves utilizing a quantum circuit-based approach to generate Julia set fractals. Quantum principles are integrated to manipulate the dataset's patterns.

Result: The paper demonstrates the successful generation of a Julia set dataset guided by quantum circuit principles, showcasing unique and complex fractal patterns.

Conclusion: Using quantum circuits for fractal generation opens a promising path for quantum generative arts, with applications spanning various artistic and ecological ecosystems.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the unresolved theoretical question of whether analog quantum simulators with global control fields can achieve universal quantum dynamics.

Method: The study provides a theoretical framework proving universality, develops optimal control techniques to engineer effective Hamiltonians, and implements experimental demonstrations using Rydberg atom arrays.

Result: The authors experimentally engineered multimode interactions, demonstrated topological dynamics, and overcame practical hurdles like hardware constraints and atom position fluctuations.

Conclusion: The research establishes a pathway for using globally-controlled analog platforms to expand quantum simulation capabilities and engineer effective multi-body interactions.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful
platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such
as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential
for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental
theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems
realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only
global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators
is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and
bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical
superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with
experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment
- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex
effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware
constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body
interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics
on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key
experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position
fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration
pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal
dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming
both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new
avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the
engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of
quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework drawing parallels between DNNs and quantum electrodynamics (QED), focusing on gauge symmetries and introducing a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work aims to explore the fundamental connection between the behavior of wide DNNs and quantum electrodynamics, offering a unifying perspective.

Method: The authors construct an analogy between neural activations and QED fields, using stochastic field theory. They propose a gauge-invariant neural network leveraging magnitude-phase parameterization of weights.

Result: Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the paper validates the mapping between DNNs and QED behaviors. It also demonstrates stability thresholds and Lyapunov exponent unification.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a connection between wide DNNs and QED, providing new theoretical contributions while proposing a practical gauge-invariant model for better neural network stability and insights.

Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps
deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1)
symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by
fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling
covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel
design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent
amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections
in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through
numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel,
propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using
magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica
approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in
stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper introduces scI2CL, a single-cell multi-omics fusion framework using contrastive learning, excelling in tasks like cell clustering, subtyping, and developmental trajectory reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of modeling and inferring cell interaction patterns from single-cell multi-omics data, which captures dynamic and continuous cellular differentiation processes.

Method: The proposed method, scI2CL, utilizes intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning to fuse complementary multi-omics data for creating comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show scI2CL outperforms existing methods in various tasks, including distinguishing subpopulations, trajectory construction, and resolving misclassification issues in single-cell data analysis.

Conclusion: scI2CL effectively characterizes cross-omics relationships, providing a robust solution for accurate multi-omics data fusion and downstream cellular analysis.

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and
analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity,
diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \&
development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to
computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell
multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics
fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn
comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary
multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over
existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight
state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell
subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell
subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously,
scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental
trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In
addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two
subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely
distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize
cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data
and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various
downstream analysis tasks.

### [354] [Huracan: A skillful end-to-end data-driven system for ensemble data assimilation and weather prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18486)
*Zekun Ni,Jonathan Weyn,Hang Zhang,Yanfei Xiang,Jiang Bian,Weixin Jin,Kit Thambiratnam,Qi Zhang,Haiyu Dong,Hongyu Sun*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: Huracan, a data-driven weather forecasting system, achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models using only observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning weather prediction models depend on numerical weather prediction (NWP) initial conditions, limiting their ability. End-to-end systems have been introduced but haven't matched the performance of NWP models.

Method: Huracan integrates an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model, relying solely on observational inputs for generating highly accurate weather forecasts.

Result: Huracan delivers end-to-end ensemble weather forecasts matching or outperforming ECMWF ENS in 75.4% of variable and lead time combinations using fewer observation data.

Conclusion: Huracan advances end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, suggesting potential improvements for operational weather prediction systems.

Abstract: Over the past few years, machine learning-based data-driven weather
prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing
more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared
to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still
rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast
abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet
to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work,
we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which
combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce
highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is
not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end
ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an
accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP
competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data.
Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of
ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a
major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up
opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather
forecasting.

### [355] [The Quasi-Creature and the Uncanny Valley of Agency: A Synthesis of Theory and Evidence on User Interaction with Inconsistent Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18563)
*Mauricio Manhaes,Christine Miller,Nicholas Schroeder*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper explores user frustrations with generative AI, introducing the "Quasi-Creature" and "Uncanny Valley of Agency" frameworks to explain discomfort arising from AI's erratic reliability despite high fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the paradoxical user experience with large-scale generative AI, specifically the frustration caused by its highly fluent yet inconsistent behavior.

Method: The authors synthesized insights from HCI, cognitive science, and philosophy to create conceptual frameworks, complemented by a mixed-methods study involving 37 participants engaging in a collaborative creative task.

Result: The study found a strong negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user frustration, highlighting the cognitive dissonance users experience when generative AI fails despite appearing very agentic.

Conclusion: This paper presents frameworks that elucidate user frustration with generative AI, proposing significant considerations for its design, ethical handling, and societal integration.

Abstract: The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman
fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper
argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem,
stemming from the "Quasi-Creature"-an entity simulating intelligence without
embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates
the "Uncanny Valley of Agency," a framework where user comfort drops when
highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as
cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI,
cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the
Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative
mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals
a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user
frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly
explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications
for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien
technologies.

*Gohar Irfan Chaudhry,Esha Choukse,Haoran Qiu,Íñigo Goiri,Rodrigo Fonseca,Adam Belay,Ricardo Bianchini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Murakkab optimizes resource usage for agentic workflows by decoupling specifications from execution and dynamically configuring models and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks are inefficient for serving agentic workflows due to fragmentation and tight coupling of various components, leading to resource wastage.

Method: Murakkab uses a declarative abstraction and combines a profile-guided optimizer with an adaptive runtime to orchestrate workflows, map them to resources, and dynamically adjust execution.

Result: Murakkab reduces GPU usage by up to 2.8x, energy consumption by 3.7x, and cost by 4.3x without compromising service-level objectives.

Conclusion: Murakkab achieves resource efficiency with significant cost and energy savings by exposing workflows' internal structure for cross-layer optimization beyond current frameworks.

Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex
control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI
applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's
frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences
of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware
choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different
entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,
latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded
service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic
workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples
workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer
and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow
components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring
execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of
agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing
frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage
by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by
4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.

### [357] [Consensus Is All You Need: Gossip-Based Reasoning Among Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18292)
*Saksham Arora*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a "gossip-based consensus" strategy for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to collaboratively exchange and refine answers, mimicking human consensus-building.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have distinct strengths and weaknesses, and no single model excels universally. This paper aims to improve performance by fostering collaboration between models.

Method: The method involves treating each large language model as a node in a peer-to-peer network, where models share answers and reasoning iteratively to achieve a consensus-based, collective decision.

Result: The gossip-based consensus method enhances robustness, resilience, and accuracy in multi-agent AI reasoning by mitigating individual model weaknesses and leveraging collective strengths.

Conclusion: The approach not only improves the performance of LLMs but also makes them appear more collaborative and trustworthy, aligning AI behavior closer to human consensus-building systems.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in
every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one
model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,
where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.
In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared
solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses
and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that
this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate
multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models
and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how
humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy
instead of just a black-box program.

*Ryan Hare,Ying Tang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents a multi-agent neuro-symbolic framework for improving learner-centered digital learning environments using an RL-based 'tutor' agent and an LLM-powered 'peer' agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of empowering students to take ownership of their learning through learner-centered methodologies in digital environments.

Method: Using a multi-agent neuro-symbolic framework where distinct agents have dedicated roles—'tutor' agent using reinforcement learning for scaffolding, and 'peer' agent using large language models for collaborative learning.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the framework's adaptability across college-level and middle school settings through case studies.

Conclusion: The framework resolves key challenges in learner-centered education and shows promise for future development in AI-driven learning environments.

Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future
directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: FairSkillMARL framework and MARLHospital environment address fairness in task allocation in MARL, focusing on both workload balance and skill-task alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle fairness issues in MARL by addressing workload balance and expertise alignment, which are critical in real-world domains like healthcare to prevent burnout and inefficiency.

Method: The authors developed FairSkillMARL framework targeting fairness as dual objectives (workload balance and skill alignment). They also introduced MARLHospital as a simulator to model team dynamics and test scheduling effects.

Result: Experiments show that fairness based on equal workload distribution causes task-skill mismatches. The paper highlights the importance to evolve fairness metrics for multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Fairness in MARL systems must consider both workload balance and expertise alignment, laying groundwork for future studies and metrics in heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort
with expertise is critical.

TL;DR: This review analyzes fairness and bias in ASR and language tech for diverse communities, proposing a governance-centered ASR framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the marginalization of African American English (AAE) speakers and linguistically diverse communities in speech AI.

Method: Conducted a scoping review of 44 peer-reviewed papers across HCI, ML/NLP, and Sociolinguistics, focusing on fairness, equity, and inclusion in ASR systems.

Result: Identified key research themes: ASR harms, inclusive data practices, linguistic inclusion, and equitable system design, while highlighting gaps in governance-centered approaches.

Conclusion: Proposes a governance-centered ASR lifecycle framework to foster community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory accountability in speech AI systems.

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are
conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and
adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English
(AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44
peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine
Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we
identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand
ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation,
annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches
to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations
for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing,
our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that
foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory
accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent
interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer
implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to
address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

*Haijie Yang,Zhenyu Zhang,Hao Tang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EAI-Avatar is a novel method for creating emotion-aware talking head generation with seamless transitions, utilizing large language models for dyadic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for talking head generation are typically one-way and lack emotion-adaptive capabilities, limiting their use in conversational interactions.

Method: The authors developed a framework combining a Transformer-based head mask generator for temporally consistent motion features and an interactive talking tree structure for guiding dialogue state transitions and emotional synthesis.

Result: EAI-Avatar demonstrates superior performance in generating lifelike, emotionally expressive talking avatars during experiments.

Conclusion: This framework enables realistic and emotionally adaptive talking head generation suitable for dynamic, bidirectional conversational uses.

Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head
generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely
on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional
conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities,
significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic
interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language
models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual
avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between
speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head
mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent
mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask
sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive
talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree
node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current
character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract
rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and
effectiveness of our method.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: INSIDE is a novel data augmentation method that creates synthetic speaker identities by interpolating embeddings, improving model training for speaker verification and gender classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of limited speaker identity data for speaker verification due to cost, difficulty in collection, and privacy concerns.

Method: INSIDE generates new speaker identities by interpolating between embeddings in a pretrained speaker space using spherical linear interpolation, followed by synthesis of corresponding speech waveforms via a text-to-speech system.

Result: Experiments demonstrate 3.06% to 5.24% relative improvements in speaker verification and 13.44% relative improvement in gender classification using INSIDE-expanded data.

Conclusion: INSIDE provides a scalable and flexible augmentation technique that enhances training pipelines for speaker-related tasks and complements other methods.

Abstract: The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely
attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However,
collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often
limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE
(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion
method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between
existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker
embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate
embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings
are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech
waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train
downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded
data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\%
relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker
verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,
where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible
with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable
addition to existing training pipelines.

### [364] [Federative ischemic stroke segmentation as alternative to overcome domain-shift multi-institution challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18296)
*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a federated learning framework to enhance ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in DWI sequences across institutions, demonstrating improved generalization and accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke lesion analysis via imaging is currently inconsistent due to variations in patient data, scanner types, and expert annotations, creating the need for a robust and generalized computational segmentation approach.

Method: The authors developed a collaborative federated learning framework using deep center-independent representations, trained over data from 14 simulated healthcare centers.

Result: The proposed FedAvg model achieved notable segmentation metrics (DSC of 0.71, AVD of 5.29, and LF1 of 0.70) and displayed strong generalization across lesion types and out-of-distribution centers without retraining.

Conclusion: The federated framework offers an effective, generalizable solution for stroke lesion segmentation, outperforming centralized methods and demonstrating consistent results across varied datasets.

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Result: SalUn achieved performance comparable to full retraining, demonstrating its efficiency in medical applications.

Conclusion: The study presents SalUn as a practical and robust solution for machine unlearning in medical image classification, with potential for preserving sensitive data privacy.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove private or sensitive data from a

advances, this technique has not been explored in medical image classification.
This work evaluates the SalUn unlearning model by conducting experiments on the

TL;DR: This paper proposes improvements for macular edema segmentation using a weakly-supervised approach by leveraging retinal layer information and test-time-adaptation strategies, closing the gap with fully-supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Macular edema analysis typically requires expensive expert-annotated datasets, and weakly-supervised anomaly-detection methods, while cheaper, underperform compared to fully-supervised approaches.

Method: The approach includes combining retinal layer information in SD-OCT images to refine edema area predictions with post-processing and introducing a test-time-adaptation strategy to address discrepancies between training and test data.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets showed improved accuracy and robustness in segmentation performance using the proposed techniques.

Conclusion: Incorporating retinal layer information and test-time-adaptation reduces the performance gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised macular edema segmentation models.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Motivation: MRI acquisition is time-consuming; segmentation of undersampled MRI without perfect reconstruction could address this concern.

Method: Authors created a unified benchmark and compared seven segmentation methods across two datasets while focusing on one-stage versus two-stage approaches.

Result: Two-stage methods that emphasize data-consistency deliver better segmentation scores than specialized one-stage methods.

Conclusion: Optimal strategies for MRI segmentation prioritize simple, data-consistent two-stage methods over complex one-stage approaches.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

### [369] [RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154)
*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM leverages sensor RAW data for photo restoration, surpassing limitations of sRGB diffusion by introducing novel components and achieving higher fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlighting the limitations of sRGB-domain diffusion methods due to lossy and sub-optimal input handling, and exploring RAW image's potential for improved fidelity.

Method: RDDM introduces a RAW-domain VAE for latent representations, a Post Tone Processing module for joint optimization, scalable RAW degradation pipeline, and a configurable multi-bayer module.

Result: RDDM exhibited superior fidelity and fewer artifacts compared to state-of-the-art sRGB methods through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Directly restoring RAW domain data enables bypassing traditional pipelines and leads to enhanced photo-realistic image restoration.

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

*Aneesh Rangnekar,Harini Veeraraghavan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents RF-Deep, a random forest classifier leveraging deep features to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) CT scans and improve cancer segmentation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the degradation of performance in transformer-based models for cancer segmentation when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) CT datasets.

Method: The method involves a Swin Transformer encoder pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled CT scans, connected to a convolution decoder for segmentation and augmented with RF-Deep for OOD detection.

Result: RF-Deep outperformed established OOD methods, achieving FPR95 rates of 18.26%, 27.66%, and <0.1% on pulmonary embolism (PE), COVID-19, and abdominal CT datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: RF-Deep is a simple yet effective approach to improve segmentation reliability in in-distribution (ID) and OOD CT data scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

*Soumen Ghosh,Christine Jestin Hannan,Rajat Vashistha,Parveen Kundu,Sandra Brosda,Lauren G. Aoude,James Lonie,Andrew Nathanson,Jessica Ng,Andrew P. Barbour,Viktor Vegh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study evaluates nnU-Net on PET-CT for tumor segmentation across diverse cohorts. It emphasizes dataset diversity over model complexity for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving robust generalization in tumor segmentation for PET-CT workflows across varied anatomical sites, scanners, and patient populations.

Method: Developed and tested 3D nnU-Net models on two new expert-annotated datasets from Australian and Indian cohorts, using different training paradigms: target-only, public-only, and combined training.

Result: Target-only model overfitted to its domain, public-only model generalized better but underperformed in specific cohorts, and the combined model achieved a better balance of performance across all cohorts.

Conclusion: Dataset diversity (multi-demographic, multi-center, and multi-cancer) is more crucial than architectural novelty for achieving robust and generalized tumor segmentation on PET-CT scans.

Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor
segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners,
and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer
evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated
whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort)
and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public
AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain
performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms.
Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For
the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain
accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC
less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model
generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung
cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).
The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung
(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and
improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that
dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi
cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust
generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep
learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than
model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

*Eichi Takaya,Ryusei Inamori*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pretraining method using modality and anatomy metadata to improve representation learning in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation scarcity in medical imaging limits supervised pretraining, prompting exploration of metadata as an alternative.

Method: They encode image metadata as multi-hot vectors and use a ResNet-18 with Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss.

Result: Fine-tuning showed superior AUC results compared to baselines, with notable performance on specific medical classification tasks.

Conclusion: Using metadata in pretraining offers scalable and effective representations for fine-tuning, though traditional methods may still outperform in frozen-encoder scenarios.

Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised
pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical
region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and
anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that
leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.
  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector.
A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN,
16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss,
and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary
classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast
ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).
  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL
(0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked
second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the
encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon
representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear
separability.
  Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as
multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that
improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a
strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas
SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

### [374] [A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439)
*Anders Mølmen Høst,Pierre Lison,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Vulnerability databases like NVD lack details about practical exploitation tactics (TTPs). This paper presents TRIAGE, an automated method using Large Language Models to map CVEs to ATT&CK techniques, combining rule-based reasoning and data-driven inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vulnerability databases do not provide sufficient information on real-world impact, necessitating automated solutions for linking CVEs to adversary tactics due to high volume and complexity.

Method: The paper introduces TRIAGE, which combines two LLM-based strategies: a rule-based approach aligned with MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology and in-context learning techniques to derive relevant mappings.

Result: Evaluation demonstrates TRIAGE's hybrid approach achieves superior recall for exploitation mapping, with GPT-4o-mini outperforming Llama3.3-70B in task accuracy.

Conclusion: The research shows that LLMs can be effectively utilized for predicting the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, making CVE-to-ATT&CK mapping faster and more efficient.

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but
often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the
vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a
challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities
published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK
knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE
Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then
combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context
learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach
strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our
evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping
methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We
also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.
Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the
impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping
CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.
  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language
models, automated mapping.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a lightweight blockchain framework utilizing virtualization and clustering for IoT, alongside an optimized Weight-Based-Selection (WBS) PoA consensus algorithm to address scalability, energy, and latency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges of centralized IoT systems, including issues with system scalability, energy consumption, and latency in traditional blockchain-based PoA consensus algorithms like Turn-Based Selection (TBS).

Method: The authors developed a decentralized IoT architecture using a lightweight blockchain enhanced with virtualization and clustering. They replaced the traditional PoA algorithm (TBS) with a novel Weight-Based-Selection (WBS) method to optimize validator selection.

Result: The proposed WBS method outperformed TBS in simulations, showing reduced energy consumption and response time, alongside enhanced throughput for IoT systems.

Conclusion: By introducing the WBS-based PoA algorithm and a lightweight, decentralized blockchain framework, this study successfully enhances IoT scalability, reliability, and efficiency, confirming its potential in large-scale implementations.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is applied in various fields, and the number of
physical devices connected to the IoT is increasingly growing. There are
significant challenges to the IoT's growth and development, mainly due to the
centralized nature and large-scale IoT networks. The emphasis on the
decentralization of IoT's architecture can overcome challenges to IoT's
capabilities. A promising decentralized platform for IoT is blockchain. Owing
to IoT devices' limited resources, traditional consensus algorithms such as PoW
and PoS in the blockchain are computationally expensive. Therefore, the PoA
consensus algorithm is proposed in the blockchain consensus network for IoT.
The PoA selects the validator as Turn-based selection (TBS) that needs
optimization and faces system reliability, energy consumption, latency, and low
scalability. We propose an efficient, lightweight blockchain for decentralizing
IoT architecture by using virtualization and clustering to increase
productivity and scalability to address these issues. We also introduce a novel
PoA based on the Weight-Based-Selection (WBS) method for validators to validate
transactions and add them to the blockchain. By simulation, we evaluated the
performance of our proposed WBS method as opposed to TBS. The results show
reduced energy consumption, and response time, and increased throughput.

### [377] [UniC-RAG: Universal Knowledge Corruption Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18652)
*Runpeng Geng,Yanting Wang,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UniC-RAG introduces a universal attack on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, capable of corrupting diverse queries with minimal adversarial inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in RAG systems, which are susceptible to knowledge corruption attacks that can alter their outputs to fulfill malicious objectives.

Method: UniC-RAG formulates knowledge corruption attacks as an optimization problem. It employs a clustering-based approach to optimize a small subset of adversarial texts, making them effective across diverse user queries.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 90% attack success rate using only 100 adversarial texts in a database with millions of entries. Existing defenses fail to adequately protect against such attacks.

Conclusion: UniC-RAG demonstrates the critical need for improved defense mechanisms to safeguard RAG systems against universal knowledge corruption threats.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in
real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to
knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts
into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate
attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific
queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose
UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike
prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that
can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics
and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such
as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,
or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an
optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,
including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's
effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly
effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could
achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a
knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set
of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and
show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the
need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

TL;DR: The paper discusses FALCON, an autonomous system using Large Language Models to generate and evaluate IDS rules in real-time, achieving 95% accuracy and high analyst agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of frequent rule updates in signature-based IDS systems caused by evolving cyber threats, which delay deployment and weaken security readiness.

Method: FALCON leverages Large Language Models to autonomously generate deployable IDS rules from CTI data and validate them through multi-phased internal evaluation. It targets both network and host-based IDS mediums.

Result: FALCON demonstrated 95% accuracy in automatic rule generation with 84% inter-rater agreement among cybersecurity analysts during evaluation.

Conclusion: The system showcases the feasibility and effectiveness of LLMs in enabling real-time IDS rule generation, enhancing cyber threat mitigation.

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities
by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are
derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack
signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual
threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into
actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and
prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates
frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security
readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with
internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that
generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them
using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target
both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a
comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our
evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an
average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%
inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.
These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data
mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

### [379] [The Double-edged Sword of LLM-based Data Reconstruction: Understanding and Mitigating Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Differential Privacy Text Sanitization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18976)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Alexandra Klymenko,Andreea-Elena Bodea,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit or improve differentially private text sanitization, highlighting both risks (privacy vulnerabilities) and benefits (quality enhancements).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address contextual vulnerability in DP text sanitization, where randomization can leave contextual clues susceptible to adversarial inference, especially given the rising capabilities of LLMs.

Method: The authors test LLMs against DP-sanitized texts to identify privacy vulnerabilities and explore how LLMs can reconstruct or improve these texts across different sanitization mechanisms and privacy settings.

Result: Experiments reveal that LLMs can infer original semantics, occasionally compromising privacy protections, but they also enhance the utility and quality of DP-sanitized texts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by recommending LLM-based data reconstruction as an adversarial post-processing step to boost privacy safeguards while retaining text quality.

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how SOC specialists integrate and use LLMs in live cybersecurity settings.

Method: Analyzed 10 months of SOC GPT-4 usage via BERTopic and a novel topic modeling workflow.

Result: SOC operators used the LLM primarily to understand complex text strings (~40% of usage).

Conclusion: LLMs can significantly support SOC workflows, suggesting design opportunities for collaborative tools tailored to SOC environments.

Abstract: Objective: This work describes the topic modelling of Security Operations
Centre (SOC) use of a large language model (LLM), during live security
operations. The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily
use this tool.
  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but
transformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC
personnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live
security operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the
LLM into their work.
  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing
GPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two
topic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model
(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.
  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed
that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of
complex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM
usage.
  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands
and similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support
this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by
designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.
  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security
Operations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows
supporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for
executing a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.

### [381] [Hidden Tail: Adversarial Image Causing Stealthy Resource Consumption in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18805)
*Rui Zhang,Zihan Wang,Tianli Yang,Hongwei Li,Wenbo Jiang,Qingchuan Zhao,Yang Liu,Guowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Hidden Tail,' a stealthy attack method on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to exploit their computational costs by inducing maximum-length outputs without compromising attack concealment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attacks on VLMs compromise stealthiness by generating extended outputs with irrelevant contents, making them detectable. There is a demand for a more covert approach to resource consumption attacks.

Method: The proposed 'Hidden Tail' method crafts adversarial images containing invisible special tokens, balancing semantic preservation, inducing repetitive tokens, and suppressing the EOS via a composite loss function with dynamic weighting.

Result: The method significantly enhances effectiveness, achieving up to 19.2x longer outputs compared to prior attacks while maintaining stealth, by avoiding noticeable aberrations in generated content.

Conclusion: 'Hidden Tail' demonstrates the vulnerability of VLMs to efficiency-oriented attacks, signaling a need for improved robustness in these models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for vision-language models either harm utility or fail to detect complex threats, creating a critical need for an effective safety solution.

Method: PRISM combines a structured reasoning dataset (PRISM-CoT) with a refinement method (PRISM-DPO) that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: PRISM achieves low attack success rates, significant robustness against adaptive attacks, generalizes well across challenges, and maintains/enhances utility in several cases.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a robust and utility-preserving approach to safeguard vision-language models, making it a significant advancement in the field of AI safety.

Abstract: Safeguarding vision-language models (VLMs) is a critical challenge, as
existing methods often suffer from over-defense, which harms utility, or rely
on shallow alignment, failing to detect complex threats that require deep
reasoning. To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated
Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by
embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists
of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware
chain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference
Optimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack
success rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90%
improvement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also
exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing
computational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on
the challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is
achieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility. To
promote reproducibility, we have made our code, data, and model weights
available at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/PRISM.

### [383] [Attackers Strike Back? Not Anymore -- An Ensemble of RL Defenders Awakens for APT Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19072)
*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining deep learning, reinforcement learning, and active learning to enhance the detection of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APTs pose significant risks to digital infrastructures due to their stealthy and adaptive nature, exposing the limitations of static, signature-based detection systems.

Method: The framework integrates auto-encoders for encoding behaviors and multiple reinforcement learning agents trained to classify malicious vs. benign activities. An active learning loop refines boundaries through simulated expert insights, and ensemble voting balances agent output.

Result: The architecture improves adaptability to evolving attack strategies by using latent behavioral encoding, multi-agent analysis, and an active learning feedback mechanism.

Conclusion: The proposed system addresses the static challenges in existing solutions, offering a more dynamic and robust mechanism for identifying and mitigating APT threats.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern
digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,
adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.
This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep
learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,
adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent
behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each
trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We
identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static
nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our
architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial
defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When
any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active
learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.
An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures
robust final predictions.

*Joshua Lee,Ali Arastehfard,Weiran Liu,Xuegang Ban,Yuan Hong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SecureV2X, a multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences in V2X applications, which significantly outperforms existing secure systems in performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of V2X and autonomous driving technologies has raised privacy concerns due to the machine learning processes involved, particularly with sensitive data such as location or medical information.

Method: The researchers developed SecureV2X, a scalable and multi-agent system designed to facilitate secure neural network inferences between a server and vehicles, studying two applications: secure drowsiness detection and secure red-light violation detection.

Result: The proposed system demonstrated strong performance, being 9.4 times faster, requiring 143 times fewer computational rounds, and involving 16.6 times less communication for secure drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems. It also achieved runtime nearly 100 times faster in object detection tasks for red-light violation detection.

Conclusion: SecureV2X effectively addresses privacy concerns in V2X machine learning applications while maintaining efficiency and scalability, showcasing significant improvements over existing secure systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving and V2X technologies have developed rapidly in the past
decade, leading to improved safety and efficiency in modern transportation.
These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside
infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning
capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems
raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly
concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can
implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as
EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable,
multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the
server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X
applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation
detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and
scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions
simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires
$143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less
communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems.
Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art
benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.

### [385] [Facilitating Matches on Allocation Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18325)
*Yohai Trabelsi,Abhijin Adiga,Yonatan Aumann,Sarit Kraus,S. S. Ravi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores how an allocation facilitator can optimize goods allocation by encouraging agents to relax restrictions while adhering to constraints and fairness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and social welfare in goods allocation platforms by relaxing agents' restrictions without negatively impacting their outcomes.

Method: The authors formalize the problem with participation guarantees, design polynomial algorithms for solving it under different settings, and validate their approach through experiments on real-world datasets.

Result: They present efficient algorithms for the facilitator's optimization problem and show positive social-good outcomes, with varying results based on constraints and participation guarantees.

Conclusion: Facilitating relaxed restrictions under well-defined constraints enhances social utility, with polynomial solutions applicable in practical scenarios.

Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an
allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator''
aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by
encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the
same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.
Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.
`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to
relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an
optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned
constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal
definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the
facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees
and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial
algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization
problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We
demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the
implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive
experimentation on three real-world datasets.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EMind is a foundational model for electromagnetic signals, addressing challenges like heterogeneity, noise, and lack of datasets by introducing a unified large dataset and efficient learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges encountered in electromagnetic signal analysis, such as heterogeneity, noise, complex structures, lack of cross-task generalization, and the scarcity of standardized datasets.

Method: The study introduces EMind, leveraging the first large-scale electromagnetic signal dataset, along with a length-adaptive multi-signal packing method and hardware-aware training strategy.

Result: EMind demonstrated strong and generalized performance across diverse electromagnetic signal-related tasks, outperforming task-specific models.

Conclusion: EMind bridges the gap between large-scale pretraining and electromagnetic signal processing, offering a unified framework suitable for diverse tasks by leveraging physical signal properties and advanced training methods.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework combining blockchain and Federated Learning for enhancing security in UAV-based Non-Terrestrial Networks through adaptive trust scoring and an energy-aware consensus mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV-based NTNs are highly susceptible to security attacks caused by their distributed and dynamic nature, leading to vulnerabilities like rogue nodes.

Method: The framework integrates Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with Federated Learning to enable privacy-preserving trust evaluations. It dynamically updates trust scores based on past trust, current behavior, and energy contributions, and uses an energy-aware consensus mechanism for resource efficiency.

Result: The proposed mechanism achieves 94% trust score prediction accuracy, 96% rogue UAV detection rate, and outperforms baseline methods in privacy, energy efficiency, and reliability.

Conclusion: The framework meets 6G requirements for distributed intelligence and sustainability while providing a scalable, energy-efficient solution for securing UAV-based NTNs.

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as
base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their
distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In
this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware
Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The
proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with
Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust
ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust,
present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to
changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes
UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use
of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with
trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model.
Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score
prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming
centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy
efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of
distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and
scalable solution to secure NTNs.

*Wenshuai Liu,Yiming Dong,Ziming Wang,Lijing Shao*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper proposes using a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, providing more efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for compact data storage and rapid processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational-wave data analysis requires rapid and efficient methods for analyzing compact binary coalescences and constructing GW event catalogs. Current approaches can be computationally expensive and less interpretable, highlighting the need for improved techniques.

Method: The authors employ the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) with learnable spline activation functions, offering greater interpretability, accuracy, and parameter efficiency. They create a neural density estimator that compresses GW posterior samples into small model weights and distills further into even smaller analytic expressions.

Result: The proposed KAN-based approach compresses megabyte-scale GW posterior samples into tens of kilobytes while maintaining high fidelity. These smaller models or analytic expressions enable rapid posterior sample regeneration, supporting efficient GW data analysis.

Conclusion: This lightweight and efficient approach enhances data storage, transmission, and subsequent analyses of GW events, aiding next-generation gravitational-wave detector workflows.

Abstract: Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the
gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter
estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for
subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the
application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient
and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior
construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions
with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher
accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks.
Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which
ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model
weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only
several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights
with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with
fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic
expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction
strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission,
paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the
next-generation GW detectors.

*Yipeng Zhang,Chen Wang,Yuzhe Zhang,Jacky Jiang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that converts natural language queries into query plans to overcome SQL limitations and perform advanced data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of efficient querying and analyzing large datasets, especially for non-programmers without SQL expertise, necessitates a more accessible and versatile solution.

Method: A framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively interpret natural language queries, construct operation sequences, and execute these directly on the data for complex analytical tasks.

Result: The framework performs effectively on standard databases and large scientific tables, handling both extensive datasets and advanced analytical functions like anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses SQL's shortcomings, providing a flexible and extensible approach to querying and analyzing large, complex datasets through natural language.

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

TL;DR: SISO is a semantic caching system designed for efficient large language model (LLM) serving, outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art caching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies of traditional and state-of-the-art caching strategies in serving LLMs that struggle to meet Service Level Objectives under computational and memory limitations.

Method: SISO employs centroid-based caching, locality-aware replacement, and dynamic thresholding to optimize query semantics, memory use, and achieve balance between accuracy and latency.

Result: SISO achieves up to 1.71 times higher cache hit ratios and better adherence to Service Level Objectives compared to current leading systems.

Conclusion: SISO redefines efficiency with innovative caching strategies, presenting a significant improvement in LLM serving under constrained workloads.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints.
Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and
prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches
remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual
departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that
redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to
maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve
high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency
under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to
1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment
compared to state-of-the-art systems.

*Shanyan Lai*

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: The paper applies various pretrained RNN attention mechanisms, including self-attention and sparse-attention, to asset pricing for large-cap US stocks during different market conditions, focusing on overcoming traditional ML limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional machine learning approaches in asset pricing, such as short memory and errors in capturing temporal dependencies.

Method: Pretrained RNN attention models with additive attention, Luong's mechanisms, global self-attention, and sliding window sparse-attention are tested across three market conditions. Causal masks are enforced to avoid future data leakage.

Result: Self-attention and sparse-attention models showed strong performance in optimizing returns and mitigating risks during stressed market conditions, achieving high annualized Sortino ratios and stable outcomes.

Conclusion: Attention-based RNN models can enhance asset pricing methodologies, offering both improved returns and stability amidst varying market conditions, and provide insights for economic research.

Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the
mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three
attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse
attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420
large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale
state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing
context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML)
based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short
memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address
the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based
models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also
consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and
mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model
structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research.
All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild
uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year
post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the
stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that
in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att
exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging
downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80
respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more
stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns
with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.

*Jakub Michańków*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The study investigates the use of deep learning (CNN and LSTM) models to forecast probability distributions of financial returns, comparing their performance with traditional GARCH models. LSTM paired with skewed Student's t distribution showed the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate and robust forecasting methods for financial risk assessment and portfolio management, as traditional econometric models like GARCH exhibit limitations in capturing complexities like heavy tails and asymmetry in financial data.

Method: The paper used deep neural network architectures (1D CNN and LSTM) to directly optimize distribution parameters for Normal, Student’s t, and skewed Student’s t distributions through custom negative log-likelihood loss functions. The models were evaluated using metrics like Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT).

Result: Deep learning models produced accurate distributional forecasts, with the LSTM model using skewed Student's t distribution showing superior performance in capturing heavy tails and asymmetry. They were competitive with GARCH models in estimating Value-at-Risk.

Conclusion: Deep neural networks, particularly LSTM architectures, are promising alternatives to traditional econometric models for financial forecasting, improving risk assessment and portfolio management capabilities.

Abstract: This study evaluates deep neural networks for forecasting probability
distributions of financial returns. 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures are used to forecast parameters of
three probability distributions: Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t.
Using custom negative log-likelihood loss functions, distribution parameters
are optimized directly. The models are tested on six major equity indices (S\&P
500, BOVESPA, DAX, WIG, Nikkei 225, and KOSPI) using probabilistic evaluation
metrics including Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability
Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT). Results show that deep
learning models provide accurate distributional forecasts and perform
competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. The
LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performs best across multiple
evaluation criteria, capturing both heavy tails and asymmetry in financial
returns. This work shows that deep neural networks are viable alternatives to
traditional econometric models for financial risk assessment and portfolio
management.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a neural network designed to model complex, temperature-dependent plastic deformation behaviors efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neural network models for plasticity, like GRUs and LSTMs, struggle with high training times, poor extrapolation, and dependence on time resolution, while existing surrogates only handle simpler material behaviors.

Method: The authors developed TRNO, a time-resolution-independent neural architecture, and applied it to simulate the temperature-dependent plastic response of complex materials like polycrystalline magnesium.

Result: TRNO achieved high predictive accuracy, generalization across various conditions, outperforming GRU and LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. It also enabled faster multiscale simulations, with a speedup of over three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: TRNO proves to be an effective and efficient alternative for modeling complex plastic deformation in computational mechanics, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational
mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often
rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from
long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate
poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity
handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a
time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the
temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which
shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high
predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases,
temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and
LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we
demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at
least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for improving robust control barrier functions (R-CBFs) to address issues like infeasibility and high control effort in safety-critical applications. Experimental results show improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate state estimation is crucial for safety in control applications. Current R-CBFs often lead to conservativeness and operational issues like infeasibility and high control effort.

Method: The authors introduce an optimization-based online parameter adaptation scheme to reduce R-CBF conservativeness, merge safety constraints using Poisson's equation, and tackle dual relative degree issues in vehicle tracking.

Result: Experimental trials showcase that the proposed approach outperforms existing R-CBF formulations, demonstrating improved safety and control effort management.

Conclusion: The study proposes a systematic improvement to R-CBF frameworks, enhancing their practical application and reducing conservativeness while maintaining safety guarantees.

Abstract: Measurements and state estimates are often imperfect in control practice,
posing challenges for safety-critical applications, where safety guarantees
rely on accurate state information. In the presence of estimation errors,
several prior robust control barrier function (R-CBF) formulations have imposed
strict conditions on the input. These methods can be overly conservative and
can introduce issues such as infeasibility, high control effort, etc. This work
proposes a systematic method to improve R-CBFs, and demonstrates its advantages
on a tracked vehicle that navigates among multiple obstacles. A primary
contribution is a new optimization-based online parameter adaptation scheme
that reduces the conservativeness of existing R-CBFs. In order to reduce the
complexity of the parameter optimization, we merge several safety constraints
into one unified numerical CBF via Poisson's equation. We further address the
dual relative degree issue that typically causes difficulty in vehicle
tracking. Experimental trials demonstrate the overall performance improvement
of our approach over existing formulations.

*Shrenik Jadhav,Birva Sevak,Srijita Das,Akhtar Hussain,Wencong Su,Van-Hai Bui*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairMarket-RL, a fairness-aware reinforcement learning framework for peer-to-peer energy trading, leveraging large language model (LLM) guidance to ensure equitable and efficient market behavior in electricity distribution systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: P2P energy trading in modern distribution systems lacks real-time models ensuring fairness while balancing private profit and efficiency under uncertainty.

Method: FairMarket-RL combines multi-agent reinforcement learning with LLM-derived fairness scores (FTG, FBS, FPP), integrated into reward structures for participants within a simulated auction environment.

Result: FairMarket-RL improves fairness across participants, reduces consumer costs, sustains utility viability, and demonstrates robust performance in diverse scenarios, including real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework paves the way for scalable, decentralized electricity markets that ensure social equity, economic efficiency, and technical compatibility.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution
systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet
most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or
private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes
under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent
reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large
language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double
auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After
each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid
(FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are
integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that
fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The
environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard
constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability.
Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated
community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges
toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only
procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves
utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate
demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided
pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient,
socially equitable, and technically sound.
