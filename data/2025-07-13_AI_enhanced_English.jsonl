By operating on 0/1\nspikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate\noperations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for\nmore efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating\nand simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and\nSpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider\ncommunity. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve\nas a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many\nproposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN\ntopology.

A paradigmatic example are\nsynaptic dynamics: synaptic efficacy changes over time driven by different\nmechanisms. Beyond traditional node-driven short-term plasticity mechanisms,\nthe role of astrocyte modulation through higher-order interactions, in the\nso-called tripartite synapse, is increasingly recognized. However, the\ncompetition and interplay between node-driven and higher-order mechanisms have\nyet to be considered. Here, we introduce a simple higher-order model of the\ntripartite synapse accounting for astrocyte-synapse-neuron interactions in\nshort-term plasticity. In the model, astrocyte gliotransmission and\npre-synaptic intrinsic facilitation mechanisms jointly modulate the probability\nof neurotransmitter release at the synapse, generalizing previous short-term\nplasticity models. We investigate the implications of such mechanisms in a\nminimal recurrent motif -- a directed ring of three excitatory leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons -- where one neuron receives external stimulation\nthat propagates through the circuit. Due to its strong recurrence, the circuit\nis highly prone to self-sustained activity, which can make it insensitive to\nexternal input. By introducing higher-order interactions among different\nsynapses through astrocyte modulation, we show that higher-order modulation\nrobustly stabilizes circuit dynamics and expands the parameter space that\nsupports stimulus-driven activity. Our findings highlight a plausible mechanism\nby which astrocytes can reshape effective connectivity and enhance information\nprocessing through higher-order structural interactions -- even in the simplest\nrecurrent circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a model to explore higher-order interactions in the tripartite synapse and the role of astrocytes in modulating synaptic behavior to stabilize and expand stimulus-driven dynamics in simple neural circuits.", "motivation": "The paper aims to study the role of astrocytes in higher-order dynamics at synapses and reconcile their effects with traditional node-driven changes to better understand how circuits process information under the influence of different plasticity mechanisms.", "method": "The authors introduce a higher-order model of the tripartite synapse, combining astrocyte gliotransmission with pre-synaptic facilitation mechanisms, and simulate its effects on a recurrent motif of three excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons under external stimulation.", "result": "The study finds that higher-order astrocyte modulation enhances circuit stability and responsiveness to external input by expanding the range of parameters supporting stimulus-driven neural activity.", "conclusion": "Higher-order interactions involving astrocytes can effectively reshape connectivity and improve information processing in neural circuits, demonstrating their importance even in minimal models."}}

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines.

We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold.
