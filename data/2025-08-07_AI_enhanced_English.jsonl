A key\ndifficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs\ninstead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data.\nType systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism\nthat refines the type environment along individual control paths based on\ndominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express\nrefinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since\nset-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for\ntype narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and\nperformance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has\nbeen driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various\nlanguage communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and\nundesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly\nmore complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra\ncomplexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the\nproblems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type\nnarrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple\nprograms that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional\nperformance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to\nvalidate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems\nare not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided\nthey are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time\nperformance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,\nthe documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with\ntypechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical\ndimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set\nof topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should\ntypecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a\nbaseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides\ncriteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and\nnegative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the\npayoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can\nuse the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is\nworthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available\nonline. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:\nTypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight\nimportant differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among\nprogram variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.\n**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the\ntradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T\nclarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each\nlevel of complexity.

Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste.

In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by\ncompilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process\nstandardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such\ncomponents were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such\nas a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of\nsoftware evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs\nthey actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to\nreconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches\nalready produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is\navailable to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this\ncompleteness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during\nthe operation of the software systems is available.

By utilizing this mathematical formulation, we\nanalytically derive the conditions for glider patterns, which we term the\n``Glider Equation.'' We demonstrate that by using this equation as a loss\nfunction, gradient descent methods can successfully discover stable glider\nconfigurations. This approach enables the optimization of update rules to find\nnovel gliders with specific properties, such as faster-moving variants. We also\nderive a velocity-free equation that characterizes gliders of any speed,\nexpanding the search space for novel patterns. While many optimized patterns\nresult in transient gliders that eventually destabilize, our approach\neffectively identifies diverse pattern formations that would be difficult to\ndiscover through traditional methods.

This paper introduces \\textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal\nrepresentation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly\naccommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to\ndecouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared\nvanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled\nnormal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding\nof structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation\nreduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally\nembedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this\nparameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction\nalignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based\nbundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate\npose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter\ndimensionality and improving convergence stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes a 3D line representation, RiemanLine, optimizing camera localization and mapping, particularly in structured environments featuring parallel lines.", "motivation": "Existing 3D line representations overlook structural regularities such as parallel lines common in man-made environments, leading to inefficiencies in camera localization and mapping.", "method": "RiemanLine decouples line landmarks into global vanishing directions optimized on unit spheres and scaled normal vectors on orthogonal subspaces, reducing parameters and embedding parallelism naturally.
