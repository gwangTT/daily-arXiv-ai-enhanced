The machine learning community has been engaging this\nproblem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic\nsolutions for the detection of \"fake\", e.g. entirely generated or partially\nmanipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical\nsolutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too\nmuch on generative algorithms and \"fake\" data-samples, neglecting a clear\ndefinition and data collection of \"real\" images. The fundamental question \"what\nis a real image?\" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis\nshows that the development and evaluation of basically all current\n\"fake\"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution\ndatasets of \"real\" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the\nacquisition of \"real\" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over\nthe last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones\nwhich typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over\ntime) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation\nalgorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related\nto \"fake\"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to\nre-think the concept of \"real\" images. The purpose of this position paper is to\nraise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of\nresearch and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of \"fake\"\nimages is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear\ntechnical definition of \"real\" images and new benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper questions the current methods for detecting 'fake' images, emphasizing the need to redefine 'real' images and develop new benchmarks.", "motivation": "Concerns about the misuse of image generation technology have led to efforts in detecting 'fake' images, but the authors believe the definition of 'real' images is outdated and overlooked.", "method": "The paper analyzes the reliance on old, low-resolution datasets for 'real' images and critiques the evolution of modern photography techniques.", "result": "It highlights that 'real' images, often created by neural network-based algorithms in smartphones, blur the distinction between 'fake' and 'real.'", "conclusion": "The paper argues for updated benchmarks and a redefinition of 'real' images, and questions the validity of current 'fake' image detection objectives."}}
