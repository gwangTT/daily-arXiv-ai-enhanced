Methods: Pyk2's involvement in amyloid-$\\beta$\noligomer-induced hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity was investigated using\nwhole cell patch-clamp in hippocampal slices from WT and Pyk2 KO mice.

These probabilistic behaviors arise due to\nnatural noise in systems (e.g., from co-running processes), probabilistic side\nchannel attacks, and probabilistic obfuscation defenses. Second,\nmicroprocessors are extremely complex. Previous evaluation methods have relied\non abstract or simplified models, which are necessarily less detailed than real\nsystems or cycle-by-cycle simulators, and these models may miss important\nphenomena. Whereas a simple model may suffice for estimating performance,\nsecurity issues frequently manifest in the details.\n  We address this challenge by introducing Statistical Model Checking (SMC) to\nthe quantitative evaluation of microarchitectural side channels. SMC is a\nrigorous statistical technique that can process the results of probabilistic\nexperiments and provide statistical guarantees, and it has been used in\ncomputing applications that depend heavily on statistical guarantees (e.g.,\nmedical implants, vehicular computing). With SMC, we can treat processors as\nopaque boxes, and we do not have to abstract or simplify them. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of SMC through three case studies, in which we experimentally\nshow that SMC can evaluate existing security vulnerabilities and defenses and\nprovide qualitatively similar conclusions with greater statistical rigor, while\nmaking no simplifying assumptions or abstractions. We also show that SMC can\nenable a defender to quantify the amount of noise necessary to have a desired\nlevel of confidence that she has reduced an attacker's probability of success\nto less than a desired threshold, thus providing the defender with an\nactionable plan for obfuscation via noise injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Statistical Model Checking (SMC) for rigorously evaluating microarchitectural side channels, addressing challenges posed by the probabilistic behaviors and complexity of processors without requiring assumptions or simplifications.", "motivation": "Evaluating microarchitectural side channels is challenging due to natural noise, probabilistic attacks and defenses, and the complexity of real processors, which previous simplified models fail to accurately capture for security concerns.", "method": "The paper employs Statistical Model Checking (SMC), a statistically sound technique that does not require simplifying assumptions, to analyze processors as opaque systems and evaluate their vulnerabilities and defenses.", "result": "Through three case studies, SMC demonstrated its ability to rigorously assess security issues and provide actionable insights into noise injection for mitigating attacks, achieving results consistent with less rigorous previous methods.", "conclusion": "SMC provides a statistically rigorous, assumption-free method to evaluate microarchitectural side channels, paving the way for more precise and actionable security assessments in complex processor scenarios."}}

However, their\nperformance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time\nadaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during\ninference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive\nbackpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on\nlikelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our\nprior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for\nobject recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates\nadaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class\nAdaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both\nobject recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that\nadaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),\nand, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We\nformulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions\nare generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.\nThis cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood\n(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving\nclass distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with\nuncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic\nunderstanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method\nrequiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition\nand detection benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces BCA+, a training-free framework for test-time adaptation in vision-language models to enhance object recognition and detection performance.", "motivation": "To address performance degradation of vision-language models under real-world distribution shifts and improve efficiency during test-time adaptation.", "method": "BCA+ employs a cache-based approach for adaptive priors and likelihoods, incorporating Bayesian inference without backpropagation.", "result": "BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on recognition and detection benchmarks, with high efficiency due to its training-free design.", "conclusion": "BCA+ provides an efficient and unified framework for test-time adaptation that corrects both semantic and contextual shortcomings in vision-language models."}}

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces \"Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion\" (CCDD), a model that improves the expressivity and performance of continuous diffusion language models by jointly operating in both continuous and discrete spaces.", "motivation": "Continuous diffusion models struggle in comparison with discrete models due to difficulties decoding between continuous and discrete token spaces, despite their theoretical advantages in expressivity.", "method": "The proposed CCDD model uses a joint multimodal diffusion process in continuous and discrete spaces, combining the strengths of both while employing advanced architectures and training/sampling techniques.", "result": "CCDD achieved strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments, showing better trainability and sample quality.", "conclusion": "The model resolves the trainability limitations of continuous diffusion while preserving its expressivity, offering a promising step forward in diffusion-based language modeling."}}
