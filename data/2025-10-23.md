### [1] [Test-time Verification via Optimal Transport: Coverage, ROC, & Sub-optimality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18982)
*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the interplay between the generator's coverage, verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and sampling algorithm's sub-optimality in improving large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling with verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of the verifier and its imperfections during test-time scaling in LLMs, and develop a framework to quantify their interplay for improved model performance.

Method: The study frames test-time scaling with verification as a transport problem, analyzes interactions between coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, identifies a sub-optimality-coverage curve, and investigates sequential and batched sampling algorithms' trade-offs.

Result: The paper uncovers three regimes in the sub-optimality-coverage curve, analyzes the computational complexities of sampling algorithms, and provides empirical validations using Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models.

Conclusion: The proposed transport-based framework and algorithmic analysis provide insights into LLM performance optimization through test-time scaling and verification, emphasizing the verifier's role and the trade-offs in sampling approaches.

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

### [2] [Timely Clinical Diagnosis through Active Test Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18988)
*Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new diagnostic framework, ACTMED, combining Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) and large language models (LLMs) to optimize clinical test selection, improving accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency in resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosis in clinical settings is complex and prone to errors, particularly under high-pressure or resource-limited conditions. Existing machine learning methods often fail in real-life scenarios because they rely on static data and do not emulate the sequential reasoning clinicians use.

Method: ACTMED integrates Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) with large language models (LLMs) to dynamically select clinical tests that reduce diagnostic uncertainty. LLMs simulate patient state distributions, support updates, and do not require domain-specific training data. Clinicians remain engaged with reviewing and interpreting outputs.

Result: ACTMED optimizes test selection in real-world datasets to enhance diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and efficient usage of resources when compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ACTMED advances the development of transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems, reducing dependency on domain-specific data and improving real-world applicability.

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

### [3] [Rectifying Shortcut Behaviors in Preference-based Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19050)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper tackles the issue of reward hacking in preference-based reward models by introducing PRISM (Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation) to improve alignment and mitigate shortcut behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models in reinforcement learning often exploit spurious features like verbosity or agreeable tones, rather than genuinely aligning with human preferences, leading to problems in generalization and reward hacking.

Method: The authors present PRISM, an approach based on invariant theory and kernel perspective, which learns group-invariant kernels using a closed-form learning objective.

Result: Experiments show that PRISM consistently improves reward model accuracy on diverse out-of-distribution tasks, while reducing reliance on shortcuts in downstream policy models.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a robust framework for mitigating shortcut behaviors and enhancing alignment in preference-based reward models.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

### [4] [The MUSE Benchmark: Probing Music Perception and Auditory Relational Reasoning in Audio LLMS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19055)
*Brandon James Carone,Iran R. Roman,Pablo Ripollés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduced the MUSE Benchmark to evaluate multimodal LLMs in music perception, finding significant gaps compared to human experts and inconsistent results with CoT prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address weaknesses in relational reasoning of MLLMs by providing a benchmark for evaluating fundamental music perception capabilities.

Method: Designed the MUSE Benchmark with 10 music-related tasks and evaluated four SOTA models (Gemini Pro, Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, Audio-Flamingo 3) against 200 human participants.

Result: Results show wide variation in model performance, a notable gap between models and human experts, and inconsistent outcomes with Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Conclusion: The study highlights existing deficiencies in music understanding by multimodal LLMs and emphasizes the need for improved AI systems with invariant musical representations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

### [5] [A Multi-faceted Analysis of Cognitive Abilities: Evaluating Prompt Methods with Large Language Models on the CONSORT Checklist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19139)
*Sohyeon Jeon,Hyung-Chul Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Large Language Models' (LLMs) capability to analyze clinical trial reporting as per CONSORT standards, identifying their limitations and behavioral responses across different prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing integration of LLMs in healthcare, understanding their ability to assess clinical compliance in reporting is essential for automation and reliability.

Method: Two representative LLMs were systematically analyzed across three prompt scenarios using expert-validated data to examine their metacognitive and reasoning strategies.

Result: The study reveals distinct differences in how models address CONSORT items, including variations in reasoning style, uncertainty expression, and response patterns influenced by prompting.

Conclusion: Current limitations in LLMs hinder clinical compliance automation, emphasizing the need for better understanding of their cognitive and strategic adaptations to improve transparent and reliable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

### [6] [The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)
*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses computational inefficiency in reasoning models by proposing Mode Selection and Early Exit methods to optimize reasoning processes, highlighting challenges with Mode Selection solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to mitigate unnecessary computational overhead in reasoning models caused by extensive step-by-step processing, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

Method: Two methods are proposed: Mode Selection, which chooses between Long-CoT and Short-CoT modes before reasoning, and Early Exit, which determines when to stop reasoning during the process; both seek to reduce computational costs.

Result: Empirical studies show that prompt-based approaches often fail in Mode Selection due to limited classification capabilities, while internal information-based approaches have better performance but suffer from stability issues.

Conclusion: Current methods relying solely on model-provided information are inadequate for tackling Mode Selection effectively, especially in low-information scenarios, signaling the need for better approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

### [7] [WebGraphEval: Multi-Turn Trajectory Evaluation for Web Agents using Graph Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19205)
*Yaoyao Qian,Yuanli Wang,Jinda Zhang,Yun Zong,Meixu Chen,Hanhan Zhou,Jindan Huang,Yifan Zeng,Xinyu Hu,Chan Hee Song,Danqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces WebGraphEval, a framework for evaluating web agents using graph abstractions of agent actions, providing cross-model analysis and efficiency insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of web agents prioritize binary success or single trajectory conformity, ignoring structural dataset diversity.

Method: WebGraphEval abstracts agents' trajectories into a unified weighted action graph compatible with benchmarks and analyzes structural features, merging behaviors and analyzing reward propagation.

Result: Tests on trajectories from six web agents show the framework's ability to capture regularities, identify inefficiencies, and pinpoint critical decision stages.

Conclusion: WebGraphEval offers a general methodology for evaluating web agents in graph-structured, multi-path, and efficiency-aware scenarios.

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

### [8] [ChatGPT Unveils Its Limits: Principles of Law Deliver Checkmate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19261)
*Marianna Molinari,Ilaria Angela Amantea,Marinella Quaranta,Guido Governatori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ChatGPT's capability in the legal domain, comparing it with regex. It reveals shortcomings in reasoning and providing comprehensive results, emphasizing its limitations when extracting legal principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates whether ChatGPT can effectively perform tasks in the legal domain, such as extracting principles of law, which require advanced comprehension and reasoning.

Method: An experimental approach is taken, where the performance of ChatGPT is compared against a baseline method using regular expressions (Regex) for extracting legal principles.

Result: ChatGPT, despite having the necessary knowledge, fails to reason comprehensively to deliver an exhaustive output in extracting legal principles compared to Regex.

Conclusion: ChatGPT lacks the ability to fully emulate human intelligence when addressing complex legal tasks, highlighting inherent limitations in its use in this domain.

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

### [9] [An Argumentative Explanation Framework for Generalized Reason Model with Inconsistent Precedents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19263)
*Wachara Fungwacharakorn,Gauvain Bourgne,Ken Satoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an argumentative framework to explain reasoning with inconsistent precedents in AI and Law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of an argumentative explanation method for the generalized reasoning framework with inconsistent precedents.

Method: The authors examine an extension of the derivation state argumentation framework (DSA-framework).

Result: This approach facilitates reasoning and explanation using the generalized reason model for inconsistent precedents.

Conclusion: The paper advances case-based reasoning in AI and Law by supporting reasoning with inconsistent precedents through the extended DSA-framework.

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

### [10] [Learning to Make Friends: Coaching LLM Agents toward Emergent Social Ties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19299)
*Philipp J. Schneider,Lin Tian,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language model (LLM) agents can emulate human online social dynamics, focusing on mechanisms like homophily, reciprocity, and self-adaptation through coaching signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if LLM agents can replicate the social interactions and dynamics observed in human online behavior, and to identify the memory and learning mechanisms required for such dynamics.

Method: A multi-agent LLM simulation framework was developed where agents interact, adapt via a coaching signal, and follow behavioral reward functions that simulate human behaviors like information seeking, coordination, and emotional support.

Result: The agents achieved stable interaction patterns, formed emergent social ties, and produced network structures resembling real online communities.

Conclusion: The framework is effective in modeling human-like social dynamics in LLM agents and serves as a tool to study collective AI behavior and its alignment or divergence from human behaviors.

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

### [11] [Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19314)
*Jinwu Hu,Zihao Lian,Zhiquan Wen,Chenghao Li,Guohao Chen,Xutao Wen,Bin Xiao,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CKA-RL, a method to address challenges in Continual Reinforcement Learning by enabling efficient knowledge utilization and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world non-stationary environments require agents to adapt continuously, presenting issues like catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge transfer in traditional methods.

Method: CKA-RL uses a Continual Knowledge Adaptation strategy with a task-specific knowledge vector pool to utilize historical knowledge dynamically. An Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism combines similar vectors to reduce memory requirements.

Result: CKA-RL outperformed state-of-the-art methods in three benchmarks, showing a 4.20% increase in overall performance and 8.02% improvement in forward knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: CKA-RL provides a scalable solution to improve Continual Reinforcement Learning by efficiently utilizing historical knowledge, addressing key challenges in adaptation and scalability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at
https://github.com/Fhujinwu/CKA-RL.

### [12] [MSC-Bench: A Rigorous Benchmark for Multi-Server Tool Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19423)
*Jia-Kai Dong,I-Wei Huang,Chun-Tin Wu,Yi-Tien Tsai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench is a new large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate multi-hop, end-to-end tool orchestration capabilities of LLM agents in a hierarchical ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in existing evaluation benchmarks, which fail to assess challenges such as functional overlap, cross-server orchestration, and robust decision-making.

Method: The benchmark organizes evaluations into a five-level curriculum, systematically testing agent abilities across simple to complex orchestration tasks, while offering objective metrics (e.g., F1 score) rather than relying solely on LLM performance as a judge.

Result: Experiments with MSC-Bench show systemic weaknesses in current state-of-the-art agents' robustness and the negative efficiency impact of rigid hierarchies without co-designed strategies.

Conclusion: MSC-Bench is a valuable diagnostic framework for exposing agent limitations, providing insights to improve tool-using agent performance and efficiency. The benchmark is publicly available for research use.

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

### [13] [NeSyPr: Neurosymbolic Proceduralization For Efficient Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19429)
*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeSyPr, a framework for efficient reasoning in embodied environments using neurosymbolic proceduralization to enhance language models without relying heavily on external symbolic tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of language models in embodied tasks within dynamic environments constrained by latency, connectivity, and resource availability.

Method: The framework, NeSyPr, first generates task-specific plans using symbolic tools, then transforms these plans into procedural representations that are integrated into language models for streamlined and adaptive reasoning.

Result: NeSyPr demonstrates effective reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, outperforming large-scale models and symbolic planners while using smaller, more compact language models.

Conclusion: NeSyPr enables efficient, standalone reasoning within latency-sensitive and resource-constrained systems, advancing the deployment of language models for embodied tasks.

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

### [14] [SysMoBench: Evaluating AI on Formally Modeling Complex Real-World Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23130)
*Qian Cheng,Ruize Tang,Emilie Ma,Finn Hackett,Peiyang He,Yiming Su,Ivan Beschastnikh,Yu Huang,Xiaoxing Ma,Tianyin Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SysMoBench, a benchmark assessing AI's ability to generate formal models for large and complex systems, using TLA+ to evaluate correctness, conformance, and invariances of models from realistic system artifacts like Raft and Redis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the expensive nature of writing and maintaining formal models for verifying correctness in large and complex systems, combined with the potential of generative AI to generate such specifications.

Method: The authors developed SysMoBench, a benchmark focusing on concurrent and distributed systems. It uses TLA+ to measure AI performance in syntactic and runtime correctness, system code conformance, and invariant correctness, utilizing nine diverse system artifacts.

Result: The framework highlights the opportunities and limitations of current large language models (LLMs) and agents in modeling complex systems while providing an automated evaluation approach.

Conclusion: SysMoBench lays a foundation for evaluating AI-generated formal models, providing tools to better understand current AI capabilities and explore further advancements in generative AI for system specification.

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

*Runpeng Xie,Quanwei Wang,Hao Hu,Zherui Zhou,Ni Mu,Xiyun Li,Yiqin Yang,Shuang Xu,Qianchuan Zhao,Bo XU*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DAIL, a method improving interpretation and execution of natural language instructions through two components: distributional policy and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing ambiguity in linguistic instructions that hampers algorithmic performance for effective intelligent agents.

Method: The DAIL method combines a distributional policy for better task differentiation and a semantic alignment module to connect trajectories with linguistic instructions.

Result: Experiments reveal DAIL resolves instruction ambiguities and outperforms baseline methods across benchmarks.

Conclusion: DAIL offers an innovative solution to advance intelligent agents' capabilities in comprehending and following human instructions.

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

### [16] [HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631)
*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HSCodeComp, a benchmark for testing deep search agents' hierarchical rule application ability, revealing a significant gap in performance compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks fail to assess agents' ability to handle vague boundaries and implicit logic in complex hierarchical rules, critical for applications in areas like legal and trade sectors.

Method: The researchers developed HSCodeComp using real-world e-commerce data annotated by experts, consisting of 632 products requiring accurate application of Harmonized System Codes.

Result: Current state-of-the-art agents perform significantly worse than human experts (46.8% vs. 95.0% accuracy), highlighting the limitations of existing solutions and challenges in hierarchical rule application.

Conclusion: There is a need for enhanced methods to improve deep reasoning and hierarchical rule application, demonstrated by agents' underperformance on a benchmark promoting realistic, expert-level problem solving.

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

*Xusen Guo,Mingxing Peng,Xixuan Hao,Xingchen Zou,Qiongyan Wang,Sijie Ruan,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense is a framework integrating large language models into urban sensing, enhancing adaptability and transparency through multi-agent evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban sensing systems face challenges in generalization across diverse urban scenarios and lack of interpretability. AgentSense aims to address these issues.

Method: AgentSense combines classical planners with iterative refinements using multi-agent large language models, delivering adaptive task assignments and natural language explanations.

Result: Experiments on mobility datasets show AgentSense improves adaptivity, robustness, explainability, and performance compared to traditional and single-agent methods.

Conclusion: AgentSense advances web-based urban sensing with improved adaptability, transparency, and robustness, proving its efficacy in handling dynamic urban conditions.

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

*Matthew Keating,Michael Casey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a graph-based engine to assist guitar students with chord tone soloing, a fundamental practice in jazz improvisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning and practicing chord tone soloing, crucial for jazz guitar theory, is challenging for students.

Method: The method involves generating chord-tone arpeggios, creating a weighted graph with nodes representing arpeggios, calculating edge weights for transitions, and finding the shortest path to construct soloing lines.

Result: The result is a chord-tone soloing line optimized for transition tones, along with a user-friendly system for guitar students to practice.

Conclusion: The proposed system facilitates learning chord tone soloing, improving accessibility to advanced jazz guitar techniques.

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

*Silvia García-Méndez,Francisco de Arriba-Pérez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an explainable streaming win prediction solution for e-sports, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing popularity of e-sports and technological advancements in communication and cloud computing drive the need for robust e-sports analytics and explainable win prediction models.

Method: The method involves analyzing input data through sliding windows to capture game dynamics and integrating explainability into the win prediction classification model.

Result: The model achieved an accuracy exceeding 90%, outperforming competing solutions.

Conclusion: The system enhances decision-making for ranking and recommendations in e-sports while promoting trust through explainable predictions.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

### [20] [RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)
*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces RLIE, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with probabilistic modeling to improve rule-based reasoning. It emphasizes the reliability of applying probabilistically weighted rules over direct usage of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLMs can generate rules effectively, their interaction and coupling with robust probabilistic rule learning for inductive reasoning are underexplored.

Method: RLIE comprises four stages: rule generation using LLMs, logistic regression for probabilistic calibration, iterative refinement of rules, and evaluation through diverse inference strategies.

Result: Applying weighted rules directly outperforms methods that incorporate rules into LLM prompts, highlighting LLMs' strength in semantic generation but limitations in probabilistic integration.

Conclusion: Coupling LLMs with probabilistic methods enhances neuro-symbolic reasoning and helps understand both the strengths and limitations of LLMs for inductive reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

### [21] [Memo: Training Memory-Efficient Embodied Agents with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19732)
*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Memo, a transformer-based memory model for reinforcement learning tasks requiring long-term context retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents need effective memory mechanisms to operate in environments over extended periods, overcoming limitations of current models with visual inputs overwhelming transformers.

Method: Memo leverages summarization tokens interspersed with input data during training to create and retrieve compressed memories.

Result: Memo outperforms baseline models in tasks requiring extensive memory retention, demonstrating efficiency, better generalization, and robustness under inference constraints.

Conclusion: Memo provides a scalable and effective approach for integrating memory in transformer-based RL models for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PROBE, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents' proactivity in solving bottlenecks autonomously. State-of-the-art models show limitations, achieving only 40% success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the absence of effective evaluation systems for the proactivity of LLM-based agents, focusing on reasoning across sources and long-term problem-solving.

Method: The authors propose a structured benchmark named PROBE, which evaluates proactivity through a pipeline comprising: searching for unspecified issues, identifying bottlenecks, and resolving them.

Result: Leading LLMs and agent frameworks were tested with the PROBE benchmark, revealing the best end-to-end performance of only 40%, achieved by GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1.

Conclusion: Current LLM-based agents demonstrate significant limitations in autonomous proactivity, highlighting gaps and opportunities for research advancements.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: WorldTest introduces a new evaluation protocol for model-learning agents, focusing on generalized world-model utility rather than reward optimization. The protocol is implemented using AutumnBench with various tasks and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for model-learning agents focus heavily on next-frame prediction and reward maximization, limiting their utility in broader applications.

Method: WorldTest evaluates agents on reward-free exploration followed by scored tests in related environments using AutumnBench, which includes diverse tasks such as masked-frame prediction and planning.

Result: Humans outperformed models in the test, with scaling compute yielding inconsistent improvements across different environments. Significant room for improvement remains.

Conclusion: WorldTest demonstrates a generalized template for assessing world-model learning and highlights key challenges and areas for growth in agent performance.

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

TL;DR: The paper presents Res-DPU, a resource-efficient digital PIM module that achieves significant energy efficiency improvements and scalability for edge AI accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of state-of-the-art digital PIM structures, which suffer from low compute density due to bulky components, impacting scalability and energy efficiency in edge AI accelerators.

Method: The Res-DPU leverages a dual-port 5T SRAM latch, shared 2T AND compute logic, a Transistor-Reduced 2D Interspersed Adder Tree (TRAIT), and a Cycle-controlled Iterative Approximate-Accurate Multiplication (CIA2M) approach for efficient computation.

Result: Res-DPU demonstrates a 56% reduction in transistor count, a power consumption reduction of up to 21.35%, increased energy efficiency by 59%, and achieves 0.43 TOPS throughput with 87.22 TOPS/W energy efficiency in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology.

Conclusion: Res-DPU establishes itself as a highly scalable and energy-efficient digital PIM module for real-time edge AI applications, showcasing effective improvements in hardware design and computation for tasks like image recognition on CIFAR-10.

Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) has emerged as the go to solution for addressing
the von Neumann bottleneck in edge AI accelerators. However, state-of-the-art
(SoTA) digital PIM approaches suffer from low compute density, primarily due to
the use of bulky bit cells and transistor-heavy adder trees, which impose
limitations on macro scalability and energy efficiency. This work introduces
Res-DPU, a resource-shared digital PIM unit, with a dual-port 5T SRAM latch and
shared 2T AND compute logic. This reflects the per-bit multiplication cost to
just 5.25T and reduced the transistor count of the PIM array by up to 56% over
the SoTA works. Furthermore, a Transistor-Reduced 2D Interspersed Adder Tree
(TRAIT) with FA-7T and PG-FA-26T helps reduce the power consumption of the
adder tree by up to 21.35% and leads to improved energy efficiency by 59%
compared to conventional 28T RCA designs. We propose a Cycle-controlled
Iterative Approximate-Accurate Multiplication (CIA2M) approach, enabling
run-time accuracy-latency trade-offs without requiring error-correction
circuitry. The 16 KB REP-DPIM macro achieves 0.43 TOPS throughput and 87.22
TOPS/W energy efficiency in TSMC 65nm CMOS, with 96.85% QoR for ResNet-18 or
VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, including 30% pruning. The proposed results establish a
Res-DPU module for highly scalable and energy-efficient real-time edge AI
accelerators.

Conclusion: Gem5 Co-Pilot effectively automates the analysis and optimization of computer architecture design constraints, demonstrating the utility of LLMs in streamlining design space exploration tasks.

Abstract: Generative AI is increasing the productivity of software and hardware
development across many application domains. In this work, we utilize the power
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a co-pilot agent for assisting gem5
users with automating design space exploration. Computer architecture design
space exploration is complex and time-consuming, given that numerous parameter
settings and simulation statistics must be analyzed before improving the
current design. The emergence of LLMs has significantly accelerated the

in a successful design space exploration task. In this project, we first build
gem5 Co-Pilot, an AI agent assistant for gem5, which comes with a webpage-GUI
for smooth user interaction, agent automation, and result summarization. We
also implemented a language for design space exploration, as well as a Design

Motivation: To address inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of traditional two-step methods for entity linking by integrating both tasks into a single streamlined process.

Method: The paper proposes a fine-tuned model that combines entity recognition and disambiguation, utilizing large language models to enhance contextual understanding.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on out-of-domain benchmark datasets, and outperforms several baseline approaches.

Conclusion: This unified framework improves the efficiency and accuracy of entity linking processes, presenting significant advancements in handling entity linking tasks through large language model integration.

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework that uses MiniLMs, a small language model, for efficient and precise information retrieval from a curated geoscience literature corpus, demonstrating advantages over LLMs like ChatGPT-4. It focuses on computational efficiency, domain-specific semantic searches, and analyzing trends and conclusions in geoscience research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address concerns about biases and computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs) while exploring methods for effective and affordable information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature.

Method: The author constructed a corpus of 77 million curated sentences from 95 geoscience journals (2000–2024) and employed MiniLMs for semantic search and sentence-level indexing. Sentiment analysis and unsupervised clustering techniques are applied to analyze conclusions and research trends in the data.

Result: MiniLM demonstrates effectiveness in extracting domain-specific information, analyzing emotional tones, and identifying trends and contradictions in geoscience literature. The approach is computationally efficient and enhances precise information retrieval compared to generalized responses from LLMs.

Conclusion: MiniLM provides a robust and accessible approach for geoscience literature analysis. It supports fact retrieval, trend analysis, contradiction identification, and educational applications, showcasing significant potentials for researchers and educators in the geoscience domain.

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a streamlined evaluation framework using 20 prompts to diagnose instruction-following patterns in 256 Large Language Models, offering an efficient tool for assessing genuine capabilities while identifying consistent failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic evaluation of instruction-following capabilities in LLMs is challenging, especially as newer models may be trained on existing benchmarks, which can result in performance based on memorization rather than genuine capability.

Method: The authors designed a compact test suite of 20 prompts targeting various aspects of instruction-following, verified functionality of 256 LLMs from OpenRouter, and conducted comparative performance analyses across models from major and emerging providers.

Result: The evaluation uncovered consistent failure modes and identified specific instruction types posing particular challenges for the tested LLMs.

Conclusion: This work provides a streamlined diagnostic tool for assessing instruction-following capabilities and contributes one of the most comprehensive analyses of LLM performance in modern models.

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate

emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates Bengali-to-Sylheti translation using fine-tuned multilingual Transformer models and compares them to zero-shot LLMs, showcasing the effectiveness of fine-tuning for underexplored languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in machine translation for low-resource languages like Sylheti and improve inclusivity in language technologies.

Method: Fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models (mBART-50, MarianMT) and comparing them against zero-shot large language models (LLMs) for Bengali-to-Sylheti translations.

Result: Fine-tuned models significantly outperform large language models, with mBART-50 excelling in translation adequacy and MarianMT excelling in character-level fidelity.

Conclusion: Task-specific adaptation through fine-tuning is crucial to achieving better translation results for underrepresented languages. This contributes to inclusive technological advancements.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

*Shriyansh Agrawal,Aidan Lau,Sanyam Shah,Ahan M R,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes fine-tuning encoder-only Small Language Models (SLMs) for detecting machine-generated content, reporting significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness compared to Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-generated content detectors lack accuracy or efficiency when operating across multilingual domains, creating a need for better-performing models.

Method: Fine-tuning pre-trained encoder-only Small Language Models (SLMs)—specifically RoBERTA and CodeBERTa—using specialized datasets for natural language and source code.

Result: The proposed models achieve an AUROC of 0.97-0.99 and macro-F1 of 0.89-0.94, with significantly reduced computational requirements: 8-12x lower latency and 3-5x lower peak VRAM at 512-token inputs. They also maintain over 92% performance under cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations.

Conclusion: SLMs outperform LLMs in the binary classification task for detecting machine-generated content, offering high accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Authors provide reproducible training and evaluation materials.

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [32] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase, a framework utilizing large language models, improves topic modeling of noisy and informal Twitter data by rephrasing tweets into standardized language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of analyzing social media data during crises like COVID-19 is hindered by short, noisy, and informal text, leading to incoherent topic models.

Method: TM-Rephrase rephrases raw tweets into standardized language (general or colloquial-to-formal) before applying topic modeling techniques. Its performance was tested on COVID-19 related tweets using multiple modeling methods.

Result: TM-Rephrase improves topic coherence, uniqueness, and diversity while reducing redundancy, particularly with the colloquial-to-formal strategy on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm.

Conclusion: This framework enhances topic modeling for public health data on social media, enabling better analysis and understanding of public discourse during health crises and beyond.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

### [33] [Learning from the Best, Differently: A Diversity-Driven Rethinking on Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18909)
*Hongyi He,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Mingni Tang,Yi Cheng,Jintao Wang,Wenjie Li,Peng Cheng,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection (ODiS) algorithm to enhance pre-training data for large language models, ensuring both quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation in current pre-training data selection methods that often sacrifice diversity by focusing solely on high-scored data, negatively impacting performance.

Method: The authors propose the ODiS algorithm, which employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decorrelate evaluation metrics across multiple dimensions like language quality and knowledge quality. A Roberta-based scorer helps infer scores for large datasets, ensuring orthogonal diversity in data selection.

Result: ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2% inter-dimensional overlap, verifying orthogonality. Models trained on this data perform better than baselines in downstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: Orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection is essential for improving large language model training, and ODiS effectively achieves this by balancing quality and diversity.

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

### [34] [Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic pruning framework for language models to mitigate biases at inference time while maintaining adaptability and knowledge preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the persistent issues of bias, harmful content propagation, and inconsistent behavior in large language models while offering a flexible solution to adapt dynamically to conversational contexts.

Method: A pruning-based, inference-time framework is introduced that dynamically and reversibly adjusts neuron activations through adaptive masking, enabling context-aware modifications without permanent model changes.

Result: The method achieves fine-grained bias mitigation, coherent multilingual performance, and improved conversational adaptability during single- and multi-turn dialogues.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables real-time fairness control in conversational AI by offering a flexible, memory-aware solution that preserves model knowledge and prevents static irreversibility.

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMAO-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal models across various tasks, highlighting the relationship between uni-modal and omni-modal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for understanding the correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal performance in multimodal models.

Method: The authors created MMAO-Bench, a benchmark featuring 1880 curated samples, covering 44 task types, including complex reasoning tasks assessed through innovative multi-step open-ended questions.

Result: Experimental analysis indicates that weak models face bottlenecks in omni-modal performance, while strong models benefit from synergistic improvements due to multimodal capabilities.

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench effectively evaluates multimodal understanding, highlighting compositional correlations and performance dynamics between uni-modal and omni-modal tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient and explainable pipeline using lightweight transformer-based models (RoBERTa and DistilBERT) for misinformation detection, achieving competitive performance at lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing issue of misinformation on online platforms, which erodes trust and impairs informed decision making.

Method: It uses pretrained language models (RoBERTa and DistilBERT) optimized through a two-step fine-tuning strategy, incorporating token-level LIME and global-level SHAP explanations for interpretability.

Result: DistilBERT achieves comparable accuracy to RoBERTa with reduced computational requirements, validated on benchmark datasets COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lightweight PLMs, with thoughtful fine-tuning and interpretability techniques, can be effective tools for scalable and trustworthy misinformation detection.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable way to assess LLM-generated stories using social structures in narratives, comparing outputs of leading LLMs against human-written stories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human assessments for evaluating LLMs in complex creative tasks are challenging to scale. The authors aim to address this limitation with a more efficient evaluation method.

Method: The authors utilize signed character networks derived from story narratives to analyze social structures. They compare network properties across over 1,200 stories generated by various LLMs and a human-written corpus.

Result: LLM-generated stories consistently show a bias towards tightly-knit, positive relationships, aligning with previous findings based on human assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology is a valuable tool for evaluating story generation capabilities of LLMs, helping identify creative limitations and tendencies in their outputs.

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spectral analysis framework to differentiate factual reasoning from hallucinations in large language models, achieving high accuracy in detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations in large language models.

Method: Utilizes spectral analysis tools like Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and frequency ratios on transformer layer graphs demonstrated through experiments with GPT architectures.

Result: Spectral patterns consistently identify reasoning types; a detector based on these signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy compared to 75% for perplexity-based methods.

Conclusion: Spectral geometry effectively captures reasoning patterns and errors, providing a pathway for improved hallucination detection in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

*Howard Yen,Ashwin Paranjape,Mengzhou Xia,Thejas Venkatesh,Jack Hessel,Danqi Chen,Yuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work addresses challenges in long-horizon agentic search and introduces SLIM, a framework for efficient and focused web exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Popular agentic search frameworks struggle with long trajectories due to context limitations, noisy content accumulation, and hitting tool budgets.

Method: SLIM separates retrieval into search and browse tools, periodically summarizes trajectories, and achieves concise context for longer searches.

Result: SLIM performs better and at lower cost compared to strong open-source frameworks in long-horizon agentic tasks, and reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: SLIM provides a scalable solution to long-horizon search challenges with fewer errors, paving the way for better future long-horizon agents.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses spectral analysis on token graphs to identify unique computational fingerprints of transformer models under syntactic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how distinct transformer architectures process linguistic computations across languages, revealing architectural biases and imprints.

Method: The authors apply graph signal processing and analyze changes in algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value) in transformer models during voice alternation across multiple languages.

Result: Transformers exhibit architecture-specific signatures, such as Phi-3-Mini showing English-specific disruptions, Qwen2.5-7B showing shifts in morphologically rich languages, and LLaMA-3.2-1B displaying muted responses. Behavioral differences correlate strongly with these spectral signatures.

Conclusion: Training emphasis creates measurable computational imprints in transformers, providing insights into linguistic processing modes and suggesting potential for diagnostic tools assessing model biases and reliability.

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for LLMs focus on simplified tasks, not on complex, professional-domain applications like document synthesis or comprehensive reporting.

Method: ProfBench comprises over 7,000 expert-evaluated response rubrics, supplemented by LLM-Judges for scalable and unbiased evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art models (like GPT-5-high) achieve a modest 65.9% performance on ProfBench, revealing limitations in handling professional-level tasks.

Conclusion: ProfBench highlights challenges in pushing LLMs' limits in professional domains and offers a scalable framework—valuable for AI development and benchmarking.

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights
into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents OVERBENCH, a dynamic and evolving benchmark to address oversensitivity in language models by generating model-specific challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks for evaluating oversensitivity in language models degrade over time and fail to capture emerging problems and behaviors.

Method: The authors propose a framework that dynamically generates datasets tailored to individual model behaviors, aggregating data from 25 models into a single benchmark called OVERBENCH.

Result: OVERBENCH yields a robust dataset of 450,000 samples across various models, enabling detection and monitoring of oversensitivity vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Dynamic benchmarks like OVERBENCH can outperform static datasets by providing continuous insights into evolving defensive triggers in language models.

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCRIPTS, a dataset for evaluating social reasoning in LLMs using dialogues from movies in English and Korean, finding performance weakness and amplified social biases in models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance the social reasoning capabilities of large language models in interpersonal and cross-linguistic contexts.

Method: The study used the SCRIPTS dataset containing annotated movie dialogues to test models on inferring interpersonal relationships, evaluating their reasoning capabilities in English and Korean.

Result: Models performed better in English (75-80%) than Korean (58-69%), showing significant limitations, social biases, and shortcomings in handling relationships like "Unlikely."

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle with social reasoning tasks; advancements are necessary to make models more socially-aware and culturally nuanced.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

*Abeer Badawi,Elahe Rahimi,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Sheri Grach,Lindsay Bertrand,Lames Danok,Jimmy Huang,Frank Rudzicz,Elham Dolatabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two benchmarks—MentalBench-100k and MentalAlign-70k—to evaluate LLMs for mental health support based on real datasets and expert comparisons, assessing their reliability and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of large-scale, reliable dialogue datasets and frameworks to evaluate LLMs for therapeutic dialogue, a complex area requiring emotional and cognitive understanding.

Method: Developed two benchmarks: MentalBench-100k consolidates 100,000 response pairs from real scenarios and LLM-generated responses, MentalAlign-70k compares LLM judges' ratings with human expert evaluations using statistical methods like ICC.

Result: Analysis revealed systematic biases in LLM judges, reliable cognitive attribute evaluations (guidance, informativeness), lower empathy precision, and inconsistencies in safety and relevance.

Conclusion: This work establishes foundational methodologies and datasets for robust large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health contexts.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and
codes at: https://github.com/abeerbadawi/MentalBench/

### [46] [From Memorization to Generalization: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Biomedical Term-to-Identifier Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19036)
*Suswitha Pericharla,Daniel B. Hier,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs), such as Llama and GPT-4o, for biomedical term normalization, revealing differences in memorization, generalization, and performance based on identifier characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve biomedical data integration by effectively mapping natural language biomedical terms to standardized identifiers, ensuring semantic interoperability across terminologies.

Method: Evaluation of LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.1, GPT-4o) using fine-tuning strategies across biomedical ontologies (e.g., GO, HPO) to test memorization and generalization performance.

Result: Fine-tuning results varied: strong memorization gains in GO, minimal in HPO, and meaningful generalization only for protein-gene mappings. GPT-4o outperformed Llama models in baseline accuracy. Embedding analyses revealed alignment issues between terms and identifiers, particularly in GO and HPO.

Conclusion: Identifier popularity and lexicalization are crucial for fine-tuning success. Memorization improves for popular or lexicalized identifiers, while arbitrary or sparse identifiers limit generalization, hindering the performance of LLMs in certain domains.

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

*Jaesung Bae,Cameron Churchwell,Mitchell Hermon,Tsun-An Hsieh,Jocelyn Xu,Yekaterina Yegorova,Mark Hasegawa-Johnson,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) handle discrepancies between their internal knowledge and conflicting prompt information, specifically in code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs manage discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and external conflicting information, especially in code generation scenarios.

Method: The authors developed a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and analyzing conflicts, introduced novel evaluation methods and datasets, and conducted experiments with activation-level steering techniques.

Result: The study revealed that large LLMs can detect knowledge conflicts with 80.65% accuracy and showed that activation-level steering improves steering success by up to 12.6%.

Conclusion: Balancing model size, task domain, and steering direction is crucial for optimizing LLM performance in resolving knowledge conflicts, and further insights could enhance future applications and research in managing parametric knowledge conflicts.

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys the status of Tibetan AI, covering textual and speech data resources, NLP tasks, and challenges like data sparsity and orthographic variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to highlight the lack of attention on Tibetan AI systems and provide a comprehensive overview to support its development.

Method: The authors categorize existing datasets, analyze tools, compare methods and performance, and identify challenges while suggesting improvements such as cross-lingual transfer and community collaboration.

Result: The analysis reveals issues such as data scarcity, orthographic variations, and the absence of standardized metrics, obstructing progress in Tibetan AI.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a foundational reference for future Tibetan AI research, encouraging collaborative and inclusive efforts for low-resource language development.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

### [49] ["You Are Rejected!": An Empirical Study of Large Language Models Taking Hiring Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19167)
*Dingjie Fu,Dianxing Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) were tested on professional hiring evaluations and consistently failed to pass despite their coding and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technology companies need efficient methods to select skilled software and algorithm engineers due to growing demand and the capabilities of LLMs in tasks like coding and reasoning.

Method: State-of-the-art LLMs were tested on a widely-used professional hiring evaluation to assess their ability to generate job-specific competencies.

Result: All tested LLMs exhibited inconsistencies in responses compared to company-referenced solutions, failing the hiring evaluation altogether.

Conclusion: Despite their advanced capabilities, current LLMs are not yet equipped to perform at the level required to pass professional hiring assessments.

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

*Jihwan Bang,Juntae Lee,Seunghan Yang,Sungha Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TSSS, a novel efficient multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative prompting methods in multi-hop RAG are inefficient due to excessive token regeneration and unstable termination mechanisms.

Method: TSSS introduces template-based reasoning to reduce token generation costs and a retriever-based terminator for deterministic reasoning halting.

Result: TSSS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on datasets like HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, with competitive efficiency compared to other RAG-CoT methods.

Conclusion: TSSS proves effective for accurate and efficient reasoning, especially in scenarios with efficiency constraints like on-device inference.

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

*Nishanth Sridhar Nakshatri,Shamik Roy,Manoj Ghuhan Arivazhagan,Hanhan Zhou,Vinayshekhar Bannihatti Kumar,Rashmi Gangadharaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with evolving temporal knowledge, and evolveQA benchmark is introduced to evaluate this with real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to evaluate LLMs fairly on dynamic, temporal knowledge conflicts as they rely on structured knowledge bases focusing on static popular entities.

Method: The authors created evolveQA, a benchmark using real-world corpora (AWS updates, Azure changes, WHO reports) to identify temporal knowledge evolution and generate tailored questions for LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates.

Result: 12 LLMs were tested, showing up to a 31% performance drop when handling evolving knowledge versus static knowledge.

Conclusion: evolveQA highlights limitations in LLMs handling of temporal knowledge and provides a fair evaluation framework for evolving datasets.

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

*Kartikeya Aneja,Manasvi Srivastava,Subhayan Das,Nagender Aneja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a knowledge graph-based question answering system without using large language models, achieving respectable results on the CRAG benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a question answering system that does not rely on computationally intensive retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs).

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage pipeline: first, documents are pre-processed into question-answer pairs; second, these pairs are converted into a knowledge graph for graph-based retrieval, re-ranked and paraphrased for final answers.

Result: The system demonstrated performance of 71.9% and 54.4% accuracies on an evaluation benchmark using LLMs (LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo).

Conclusion: A knowledge graph-based approach to question answering can achieve decent results, bypassing the need for elaborate LLMs in retrieval augmented generation.

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TRACE and SCOPE for evaluating errors in conversational AIs using external tools, focusing on critical error cases missed by existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods fail to capture crucial errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogues, such as misinterpreting tool results while still appearing satisfactory to users.

Method: The authors developed TRACE, a synthesized benchmark covering diverse error cases, and SCOPE, an automatic evaluation framework to discover and assess error patterns and rubrics in dialogues.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SCOPE's superiority over baseline methods, particularly in identifying challenging error cases where user satisfaction signals are deceiving.

Conclusion: SCOPE and TRACE enhance the evaluation of tool-augmented conversational AIs by systematically addressing overlooked errors in existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

*Hang Zheng,Hongshen Xu,Yongkai Lin,Shuai Fan,Lu Chen,Kai Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiSRouter, a distributed routing system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with self-awareness to optimize query handling while enhancing flexibility, scalability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional query routing systems depend on centralized routers and fail to effectively balance performance and costs among diverse LLMs. This centralization limits scalability and the ability to understand LLMs' boundaries.

Method: A novel Distributed Self-Router system is developed where LLM agents autonomously decide on query handling based on their self-awareness, enhanced through a proposed two-stage Self-Awareness Training pipeline.

Result: Experiments show DiSRouter performs better in utility, manages easy and complex queries effectively, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks compared to existing routing systems.

Conclusion: DiSRouter's self-awareness paradigm demonstrates improved query routing by decentralizing decision-making among LLM agents, highlighting the potential for modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

*York Hay Ng,Aditya Khan,Xiang Lu,Matteo Salloum,Michael Zhou,Phuong H. Hoang,A. Seza Doğruöz,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for type-matched language distances, improving cross-lingual transfer by addressing limitations of existing resources like URIEL+.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linguistic knowledge bases like URIEL+ have limitations: one-size-fits-all vector representations and lack a principled method for aggregating signals into comprehensive scores.

Method: The paper proposes new structure-aware representations for language distances: using speaker-weighted distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent variables model for typology. The framework unifies these into a composite and task-agnostic measure.

Result: The proposed representations and composite distances improve performance in NLP tasks when selecting transfer languages, demonstrating the framework’s efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This framework provides a more principled and effective approach to multilingual research, addressing the diversity of linguistic data structures and improving cross-lingual tools.

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic framework for accurate reasoning and manipulation tasks on complex spreadsheets, integrating understanding, execution, and validation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face challenges in accurately reasoning over complex spreadsheets due to the intricate structure and reasoning correctness required.

Method: The method involves the creation of SheetBrain, which includes modules for understanding spreadsheets, executing queries through Python-based toolkits, and validating the accuracy of its reasoning.

Result: SheetBrain demonstrates improved accuracy over public tabular QA benchmarks and a newly introduced benchmark named SheetBench targeting complex spreadsheets.

Conclusion: SheetBrain effectively enhances reasoning and manipulation tasks for complex spreadsheets, outperforming existing benchmarks and addressing shortcomings in large language model capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for generating multiple-choice questions with controllable difficulty using a large language model, aimed at improving adaptive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable creation of difficulty-adjusted multiple-choice questions for reading comprehension to enhance adaptive learning.

Method: Proposes a large language model employing direct preference optimization for generating difficulty-controlled questions.

Result: Achieves improved accuracy in controlling question difficulty and facilitates effective multiple-choice question generation.

Conclusion: The study addresses prior limitations by generating well-controlled multiple-choice questions, advancing adaptive learning support mechanisms.

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces TheMCPCompany, a benchmark for evaluating tool-calling agents in interacting with diverse real-world services, showcasing their potential to improve performance and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current general-purpose agents relying on web browsers by exploring tool-based agents and their potential in handling real-world tasks using the MCP framework.

Method: The authors created MCP servers with REST APIs representing over 18,000 tools and provided manually annotated ground-truth tools for tasks. They conducted experiments comparing tool-calling agents and browser-based agents, focusing on performance and practicality.

Result: Tool-based agents outperform browser-based agents in most scenarios, with smaller models showing limitations in tool retrieval. GPT-5 performs comparably with ground-truth tools, demonstrating its efficiency with simpler environments but challenges in complex enterprise contexts.

Conclusion: Advanced reasoning models are effective in simpler scenarios but face significant challenges in navigating complex environments with many tools. Improved reasoning and retrieval models are necessary to handle such tasks efficiently.

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

*Fan Xu,Huixuan Zhang,Zhenliang Zhang,Jiahao Wang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces JointCQ, a framework to improve hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) by addressing limitations in claim extraction and query generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models often generate unreliable content due to hallucinations. Existing detection methods struggle with context loss during claim extraction and lack specificity in query generation.

Method: JointCQ employs specifically designed evaluation criteria to filter training data and fine-tunes a language model to jointly extract claims and generate queries for improved evidence search and verification.

Result: Experimental results show that JointCQ outperforms previous methods on various open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the reliability and transparency of language model systems for better hallucination detection pipelines.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KORE, a method for effectively injecting and retaining knowledge in large multimodal models, addressing limitations like catastrophic forgetting.


<details>

Motivation: Large multimodal models struggle to adapt to new information and often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trying to inject new knowledge.

Method: KORE employs knowledge-oriented augmentations for structured new information learning and constraints to minimize interference with pre-existing knowledge. It utilizes covariance matrices and null-space projections for retention.

Result: KORE demonstrates superior performance in knowledge injection and retention during extensive experiments on multiple multimodal models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of knowledge adaptation and retention in large multimodal models, enabling continuous learning without sacrificing existing knowledge.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

*Fan Xu,Xinyu Hu,Zhenghan Yu,Li Lin,Xu Zhang,Yang Zhang,Wei Zhou,Jinjie Gu,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a taxonomy for hallucination in natural language generation models and proposes HAD models for detection, identification, and correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the reliability and accuracy of large language models, particularly hallucinations—plausible but incorrect outputs—necessitate robust detection mechanisms.

Method: Developing HAD models, trained on a synthetic dataset of 90K samples, capable of detecting, identifying, and correcting hallucinations in natural language generation tasks.

Result: HAD models outperform baselines on hallucination detection benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HAD models effectively improve hallucination detection, demonstrating robustness and versatility across diverse natural language generation tasks.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

### [62] [Balancing Rewards in Text Summarization: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning via HyperVolume Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19325)
*Junjie Song,Yiwen Liu,Dapeng Li,Yin Sun,Shukun Fu,Siqi Chen,Yuji Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hypervolume Optimization (HVO), a reinforcement learning strategy to improve text summarization performance by optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing multiple objectives like consistency, coherence, relevance, and fluency in text summarization remains a challenge, even with advancements in large language models and reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose Hypervolume Optimization (HVO), which employs a hypervolume method to balance optimization of multiple objectives during the RL reward process, aiming to generate summaries closer to the Pareto front.

Result: HVO outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on several summarization datasets, achieving balanced performance across objectives. A 7B foundation model with HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in summarization tasks while generating shorter summaries.

Conclusion: HVO is an effective method for multi-objective optimization in text summarization, pushing performance closer to balance and competing with advanced models like GPT-4.

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

### [63] [Slot Filling as a Reasoning Task for SpeechLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19326)
*Kadri Hacioglu,Manjunath K E,Andreas Stolcke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces reasoning mechanisms into speech large language models (speechLLMs) for improved slot-filling tasks using the chain-of-thought framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of speechLLMs in slot-filling tasks by incorporating reasoning capabilities.

Method: Using the chain-of-thought framework, the authors build a reasoning dataset, apply supervised fine-tuning, and evaluate hybrid speechLLMs with reasoning and direct operation modes.

Result: Performance improves by introducing reasoning mechanisms, though textual LLMs specialized in non-speech domains are less effective as foundation models.

Conclusion: Hybrid speechLLMs fine-tuned for both reasoning and direct modes outperform single-mode counterparts, indicating a significant potential for dual approaches in speech model enhancement.

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

TL;DR: Investigates how integrating personal annotator personas into large language models affects hate speech sensitivity, with Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the biases linked to shared or differing identities between annotators and hate speech targets and reduce bias in hate speech detection.

Method: Using shallow persona prompting and deeply contextualized persona development (via Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to evaluate the impact of in-group and out-group annotator personas on model performance.

Result: Highlights the effectiveness and limits of persona-based methods in reducing bias with socio-demographic insights in hate speech detection.

Conclusion: Persona-based approaches can help in addressing biases in automated hate speech detection systems, using advanced NLP techniques but with certain limitations.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

*Prakrithi Shivaprakash,Lekhansh Shukla,Animesh Mukherjee,Prabhat Chand,Pratima Murthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOGICAL, a locally deployable system for PII removal from clinical notes using a fine-tuned GLiNER model, outperforming existing solutions while being efficient and privacy-preserving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need to remove PII from clinical notes in EHRs for research and AI development, especially in resource-limited environments where high computational costs and data privacy risks of API-based LLMs are barriers.

Method: The researchers developed and fine-tuned the GLiNER model for named entity recognition, defined nine PII categories, and evaluated its performance on clinical documents against other existing solutions in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved a micro-average F1-score of 0.980, surpassing competitors like Gemini-Pro-2.5 and effectively removing PII from 95% of the documents tested.

Conclusion: Specialised transformer models like GLiNER provide a practical, accurate, and secure method for PII removal, supporting data privacy and enabling de-identified datasets for research, particularly in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

*Varsha Suresh,M. Hamza Mughal,Christian Theobalt,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DnD Gesture++, a dataset enhanced with semantic gesture annotations, and integrates gestures into a multimodal turn-taking prediction framework, showing improved prediction results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding multimodal cues in turn-taking is crucial for advancing human-machine interaction and conversational AI.

Method: The study extends the DnD Gesture corpus with semantic annotations and employs a Mixture-of-Experts framework combining text, audio, and gestures for turn-taking prediction.

Result: Experimental results indicate that semantically guided gestures significantly enhance turn-taking prediction performance.

Conclusion: Gestures play a complementary and significant role in multimodal turn-taking, improving prediction accuracy when integrated with other modalities.

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

*Yejin Kwon,Taewoo Kang,Hyunsoo Yoon,Changouk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M3-SLU is a new multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate models in speaker-aware dialogue understanding, focusing on speaker attribution challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in current models’ ability to accurately understand speaker-specific information in natural conversations.

Method: The benchmark, M3-SLU, uses data from four open corpora with over 12,000 instances to assess models through two tasks: Speaker-Attributed QA and Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching.

Result: Results highlight that existing models excel in understanding content but struggle with accurately identifying speakers’ contributions.

Conclusion: M3-SLU provides a critical tool for improving speaker-aware dialogue understanding in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

*Xianyang Liu,Yilin Liu,Shuai Wang,Hao Cheng,Andrew Estornell,Yuzhi Zhao,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes AgenticMath, an agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical datasets, which effectively enhances the fine-tuning of LLMs for better mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving LLM reasoning struggle with incorrect or low-quality outputs and insufficiently rich datasets. There is a need for a robust pipeline to generate superior mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance training.

Method: AgenticMath uses a four-stage process: selecting complex and rich seed questions, employing multi-agent systems for consistent paraphrasing, rewriting answers with chain-of-thought reasoning to ensure correctness, and filtering high-quality question-answer pairs through an evaluation step.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned with AgenticMath datasets, despite their smaller size (30-60K samples), outperformed or matched the performance of models trained on larger datasets (e.g., 400K or 2.3M samples) across diverse benchmarks for mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Quality-targeted data generation through the AgenticMath pipeline is more effective and efficient in improving LLM mathematical reasoning than relying on large-scale, low-quality datasets.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

*Siyuan Wang,Gaokai Zhang,Li Lyna Zhang,Ning Shang,Fan Yang,Dongyao Chen,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method for enhanced long-context reasoning, showing clear improvements in reasoning accuracy and efficiency for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for advanced thinking patterns in long-context reasoning for large language models, as RL data for high-difficulty reasoning tasks are limited.

Method: LoongRL employs KeyChain to convert short multi-hop QA tasks into challenging long-context tasks by embedding UUID chains, thereby requiring models to trace, identify, retrieve, and reason over the concealed information step-by-step.

Result: LoongRL demonstrates significant accuracy gains in long-context multi-hop QA on Qwen models (+23.5% and +21.1%) and enables models to handle very long tasks (16K to 128K efficiently) rivaling larger models.

Conclusion: LoongRL improves reasoning depth and retrieval capacity in large language models without sacrificing short-context capabilities, marking a step forward in long-context reasoning development.

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: To address gaps in the available benchmarks for legal information retrieval and establish a comprehensive, open-source dataset for diverse legal applications.

Method: The authors constructed ten expert-annotated legal datasets across jurisdictions, document types, and tasks, with seven newly-developed datasets documenting their methodology and releasing data openly for reproducibility.

Result: MLEB was successfully introduced with its diverse and comprehensive legal datasets made available for information-retrieval tasks.

TL;DR: MoE-Prism enhances Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by adding elasticity, resolving inflexibility issues and improving adaptation to Service Level Objectives (SLOs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face limitations due to rigid routing mechanisms and monolithic experts, causing inefficiencies in balancing cost and quality.

Method: MoE-Prism uses an Offline Refactoring Engine to decompose monolithic experts into fine-grained sub-experts and an Online Scheduling Engine for QoS-aware dynamic resource allocation.

Result: MoE-Prism achieves 4x more operational configurations than baseline models, improving throughput by up to 19.9% and reducing latency by up to 10.36% under resource constraints.

Conclusion: MoE-Prism provides elasticity and adaptability for MoE models, fostering more efficient and QoS-aware AI services with scalable resource allocation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach to sign language translation using sentence embeddings instead of gloss annotations, improving translation systems' multilinguality and performance without requiring manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional sign language translation systems which rely on gloss annotations that are scarce and vary widely across datasets.

Method: The approach uses sentence embeddings derived from raw textual data during training as supervision, eliminating the need for manual gloss annotations.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for gloss-free sign language translation systems, surpassing previous gloss-free approaches while reducing dependence on specific datasets.

Conclusion: The method bridges the gap between gloss-free and gloss-dependent SLT systems, offering a scalable and multilingual solution for sign language translation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach for Sign Language Translation (SLT), using language-agnostic multimodal embeddings and coupled augmentation methods to enable direct multilingual translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SLT approaches are limited to single-language training and modality-specific supervision, hindering scalability and cross-language generalization.

Method: Language-agnostic multimodal embeddings, trained across multiple languages and modalities, supervise SLT. The coupled augmentation combines multilingual target augmentations and video-level perturbations for better robustness.

Result: The approach achieves consistent BLEURT improvements over traditional methods, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Language-agnostic, multilingual embedding supervision paired with coupled augmentation provides a scalable and effective alternative for SLT training.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR is a lightweight model (<300K parameters) that excels in mention detection, achieving high recall and precision across 13 NER benchmarks and showing near state-of-the-art performance with span classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the foundational challenge of identifying text spans referring to entities, which is a critical bottleneck in information extraction processes.

Method: Introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model that probes early layers of LLMs for mention detection capabilities. It analyzes mention detection performance across diverse architectures and benchmarks, employing span classification heads for extended tasks.

Result: ToMMeR achieves 93% recall zero-shot and over 90% precision using LLM as a judge across benchmarks. It demonstrates convergence of mention boundaries across models with DICE >75% and delivers near-SOTA performance (80-87% F1).

Conclusion: Structured entity representations naturally exist in early LLM layers and can be efficiently recovered using a lightweight model like ToMMeR, confirming the feasibility of efficient mention detection.

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended

(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

### [75] [Spatio-temporal Sign Language Representation and Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19413)
*Yasser Hamidullah,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DFKI-MLT's submission to WMT-SLT 2022, proposing an end-to-end system for sign language translation (SLT) using spatio-temporal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT methods often lack effective utilization of temporal features, which limits their generalization to unseen datasets.

Method: The authors designed an end-to-end seq2seq architecture that learns spatio-temporal feature representations from video frames for translation.

Result: The system achieved moderate performance on the development set (5±1 BLEU points) but drastically lower performance on the test set (0.11±0.06 BLEU points).

Conclusion: While the approach leverages spatio-temporal features in an end-to-end model, its generalization across datasets remains challenging due to significant performance drops on unseen data.

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

*Yuan Gao,Suchir Salhan,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces BLiSS 1.0, a benchmark assessing models' alignment with human language acquisition via naturalistic learner errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation of cognitively inspired language models.

Method: BLiSS 1.0 uses 136,867 triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) derived from 2.8 million naturalistic sentences to test models' ability to differentiate naturalistic learner errors from artificial errors.

Result: Experiments show that selective tolerance is a distinct ability from grammaticality evaluation, with models' performance reflecting their training paradigms.

Conclusion: BLiSS is validated as a powerful tool to measure the impact of training objectives on models' alignment with human language learning patterns.

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

*Kailin Jiang,Ning Jiang,Yuchen Ren,Yuchen Li,Yifan Gao,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Qingqing Liu,Xianhao Wang,Yifan Jia,Hongbo Jiang,Yaocong Hu,Bin Li,Lei Liu,Yuntao Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MINED, a benchmark designed to evaluate Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. It evaluates 15 LMMs, identifies performance gaps, and explores knowledge editing methods to update time-critical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMMs have limitations in handling time-sensitive factual knowledge due to their static nature, while existing benchmarks fail to assess these shortcomings comprehensively.

Method: The authors developed MINED, a benchmark with 6 dimensions and 11 tasks derived from Wikipedia. It includes 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples classified into six types.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro outperformed other LMMs with the highest average CEM score of 63.07, and knowledge gaps were identified, especially in sports-related knowledge. Knowledge editing methods showed potential for updating LMMs.

Conclusion: LMMs need improved strategies to enhance their temporal awareness and better handle evolving knowledge. Knowledge editing methods showed promise for updating time-sensitive knowledge effectively.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

*Yuu Jinnai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is shown to outperform beam search for speech-to-text tasks, showcasing improved accuracy in ASR and ST tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beam search is the current standard for speech-to-text tasks, yet sample-based MBR decoding has shown effectiveness in text-to-text generation tasks. The study aims to evaluate if MBR decoding can enhance accuracy in speech-to-text tasks.

Method: The research examines MBR decoding's performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST) tasks across English and Japanese languages using Whisper and derivative models.

Result: Results illustrate that MBR decoding outperforms beam search in most settings, delivering more accurate results for offline ASR and ST tasks.

Conclusion: MBR decoding is a promising alternative to beam search for speech-to-text tasks requiring high accuracy, with available code for further exploration.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VideoAgentTrek automates the mining of GUI interaction data from public screen-recorded videos, dramatically reducing manual annotation efforts. It uses an inverse dynamics module to generate structured training data. Results show notable improvement in task success rates and step accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of GUI interaction data at scale is highly expensive, yet critical for training computer-use agents. The paper seeks to solve this challenge by utilizing publicly available screen-recorded videos for scalable data extraction.

Method: The approach employs VideoAgentTrek, which includes Video2Action (an inverse dynamics module). This module combines a video grounding model for precise GUI action detection and localization, and an action-content recognizer for extracting parameters like click coordinates or typed text.

Result: The pipeline analyzes 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos, automatically generating 1.52 million interaction steps. Continued pretraining paired with supervised fine-tuning improves task success rates by 70% and enhances step accuracy by over 5%.

Conclusion: Passive internet videos can effectively serve as a scalable, high-quality training data source for computer-use agents, offering a viable alternative to costly manual annotation.

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

*Ryuto Koike,Liam Dugan,Masahiro Kaneko,Chris Callison-Burch,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the connection between membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection, proving their shared optimal metric and highlighting cross-task transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the overlap and transferability between methods used for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, which have traditionally been studied independently despite shared foundations.

Method: The authors conduct theoretical analysis proving the shared optimal metric for both tasks and perform large-scale empirical experiments across 13 domains with various methods, including state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: The study finds a strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance, identifying Binoculars as achieving state-of-the-art results in both tasks. It advocates for cross-task awareness and develops MINT, a unified evaluation suite.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates significant methodological overlap between MIAs and machine text detection, emphasizing a need for collaboration and unified evaluation frameworks in future research efforts.

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

*Suchir Salhan,Richard Diehl Martinez,Zébulon Goriely,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of sequence length on BabyLM language model pretraining and finds that the optimal sequence length depends on task type and model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates how the choice of sequence length in transformer language models affects task performance, particularly in resource-limited pretraining settings.

Method: Using 100M-word datasets and fixed compute budgets, the authors compare the performance of 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models across varying sequence lengths for different tasks.

Result: Longer sequence lengths generally enhance performance, but shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization tasks, while longer contexts improve performance on morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Sequence length optimization in BabyLM training should be task-specific, as different tasks benefit from different context lengths.

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

### [82] [Lookahead Routing for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19506)
*Canbin Huang,Tianyuan Shi,Yuhua Zhu,Ruijun Chen,Xiaojun Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents Lookahead, a framework for routing queries between multiple LLMs by predicting latent representations of their outputs to make informed decisions, achieving 7.7% improvement over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routing systems mainly classify based only on input queries, which overlooks potential output information and fails to handle complex or ambiguous queries effectively. There’s a need for a more nuanced approach to improve routing decisions.

Method: The paper introduces Lookahead, a new routing framework that predicts latent representations of potential model outputs using causal and masked language models to guide better model selection, avoiding full inference for all outputs.

Result: Experiments across seven benchmarks in domains like instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation demonstrate an average performance gain of 7.7% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Lookahead improves multi-LLM routing by considering latent output predictions, effectively handling complex queries while maintaining efficiency. Its performance surpasses existing methods, making it a valuable tool for enhancing multi-model system usability.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

### [83] [Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19509)
*Maureen de Seyssel,Eeshan Gunesh Dhekane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified taxonomy for evaluating speech foundation models, addressing inconsistencies across tasks and model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech foundation models exhibit diverse strengths across different tasks, necessitating a unified evaluation framework to align their capabilities with suitable evaluation methods.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy based on three orthogonal axes: evaluation aspects measured, model capabilities required, and task/protocol requirements. They classify existing evaluations and benchmarks using this taxonomy.

Result: The taxonomy identifies systematic gaps in benchmarking, such as inadequate consideration of prosody, interaction, and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The taxonomy serves as a conceptual and practical guide for evaluating speech models and highlights priorities for designing future benchmarks.

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

*Danni Liu,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates catastrophic forgetting in multilingual fine-tuning and identifies key factors causing this issue, including model-data scale and instruction-following ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in multilingual fine-tuning leads to performance degradation on languages not included during fine-tuning, and identifying factors causing this is crucial.

Method: Researchers conduct controlled experiments using machine translation as a test case, examining model architecture, data scale, fine-tuning approaches, and testing cross-lingual alignment.

Result: Catastrophic forgetting is primarily influenced by model-to-data scale; instruction-following ability is more critical than architecture. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning was not superior to full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual alignment helps mitigate forgetting and positively transfers knowledge to unseen target languages, addressing catastrophic forgetting effectively.

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

TL;DR: The researchers developed PBBQ, a benchmark dataset to assess social biases in Persian large language models, highlighting cultural bias replication within model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of resources for evaluating and mitigating social biases in Persian large language models.

Method: Developed PBBQ, a dataset consisting of 37,000 curated questions across 16 cultural categories, informed by expert collaboration and responses from diverse demographics.

Result: Current Persian language models exhibit significant social biases, replicating human bias patterns in their outputs.

Conclusion: PBBQ enables more thorough evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian LLMs, serving as a critical resource for future improvements.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable crowdsourcing approach to create a cross-lingual news similarity dataset in Ukrainian, Polish, Russian, and English, exploring multilingual fake news detection challenges using different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for detecting fake news across multiple languages, including underrepresented ones like Ukrainian, and overcoming scalability issues with existing manually curated datasets.

Method: The authors developed a scalable, explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity assessment, resulting in a novel dataset, CrossNews-UA, annotated with semantic similarity using the 4W criteria (Who, What, Where, When).

Result: The developed dataset enabled testing of various models, including traditional, Transformer-based, and large language models. Results highlighted distinct challenges in multilingual news analysis and revealed valuable performance insights of the models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of creating scalable and explainable datasets for multilingual fake news detection while underscoring the challenges posed by such tasks. It provides a foundation for improved model exploration and cross-lingual news verification.

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how stylistic fonts and font-like emojis on social media can exploit perception gaps between humans and NLP models, proposing a vulnerability called Style Attack Disguise (SAD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability introduced by stylistic fonts that are human-readable but misinterpreted by NLP models, which impacts their functionality.

Method: The authors propose Style Attack Disguise (SAD), a style-based adversarial technique, with two configurations for light and strong attacks.

Result: SAD demonstrates effective attack performance in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation across a variety of models and commercial platforms. It also showcases potential threats in multimodal tasks like text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a critical security concern in NLP and multimodal systems, urging further research into mitigating such adversarial vulnerabilities.

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

*Daria Cherniuk,Nikita Sukhorukov,Nikita Sushko,Daniil Gusak,Danil Sivtsov,Elena Tutubalina,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework, LlavaCode, which optimizes code completion by compressing code into shorter, semantically rich representations to enable faster and efficient generation in IDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of slower inference in interactive settings due to extended sequence lengths caused by incorporating additional code context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Method: LlavaCode introduces a framework that compresses code into compact, meaningful representations. These representations can be understood by code LLMs, and a small projector module is used to efficiently enhance the model's generation quality.

Result: The proposed framework improves EM and ES metrics with minimal latency increase while reducing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 20-38% for line completion tasks compared to traditional RAG pipelines.

Conclusion: Compressed contextual representations improve code completion quality and significantly enhance the efficiency of code generation applications in IDEs while maintaining low latency.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer models have greatly improved emotion recognition but face challenges in open-ended queries, prompting comparisons between fine-tuning and prompt engineering for better emotion detection. Results show success with fine-tuned models and structured prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore and overcome challenges in automatic emotion detection for open-text scenarios using LLMs and advanced techniques.

Method: Three scenarios tested: fine-tuned models vs general-purpose LLMs, effectiveness of emotion-specific prompts, and impact of emotion grouping techniques.

Result: Metrics exceed 70% with fine-tuned models. LLMs perform better with emotion grouping and structured prompt design.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning and structured prompts aid in improving emotion recognition performance, benefitting applications like sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

### [91] [DiffAdapt: Difficulty-Adaptive Reasoning for Token-Efficient LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19669)
*Xiang Liu,Xuming Hu,Xiaowen Chu,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reasoning traces in Large Language Models (LLMs) to address inefficiencies and proposes 'DiffAdapt,' a method to dynamically adjust inference based on question difficulty while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong reasoning abilities, their lengthy thinking traces often lead to inefficiencies. The aim is to balance high performance with computational efficiency by understanding and addressing overthinking in reasoning processes.

Method: The methodology involves studying the entropy of token probabilities in reasoning traces to identify patterns based on problem difficulty. A new lightweight framework, 'DiffAdapt,' selects inference strategies dynamically (Easy/Normal/Hard) using a small probe for adaptability, without fine-tuning the core LLM.

Result: The proposed 'DiffAdapt' framework improves performance and reduces token usage by up to 22.4% across five LLMs and eight benchmarks, maintaining or enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: DiffAdapt offers a practical, computation-efficient approach to reasoning with LLMs, avoiding overthinking on easy problems and intelligently adjusting inference strategies based on difficulty.

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

### [92] [CoSense-LLM: Semantics at the Edge with Cost- and Uncertainty-Aware Cloud-Edge Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19670)
*Hasan Akgul,Mari Eplik,Javier Rojas,Aina Binti Abdullah,Pieter van der Merwe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSense-LLM is an edge-first framework combining multimodal sensor data with large language models (LLMs), achieving efficient, private, and latency-aware data processing through a four-part system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize LLM deployments for environments with constraints on latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy by leveraging multimodal sensor data and edge-first processing.

Method: The framework includes four components: SenseFusion for sensor data compression, Edge-RAG for local hybrid retrieval, PromptRouter for cost-efficient policy selection, and Secure Execution for privacy-preserving data processing. Modern serving optimizations like FlashAttention and federated updates are also integrated.

Result: CoSense-LLM achieves sub-second latency, reduces bandwidth through localized retrieval, and enforces privacy by minimizing data transmission. Its edge-first design improves factual consistency and optimizes energy usage while supporting personalization.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates a successful balance between semantics, privacy, and predictable latency, making it an effective framework for LLMs in interference-heavy environments such as homes, offices, and clinics.

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

### [93] [Are Large Language Models Sensitive to the Motives Behind Communication?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19687)
*Addison J. Wu,Ryan Liu,Kerem Oktar,Theodore R. Sumers,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the ability of large language models (LLMs) to critically evaluate content by considering the motivations and intentions of the sources, finding mixed performance but some improvement with targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if LLMs can navigate information by weighing the credibility of statements and factoring in human motives, which is crucial for their effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: Controlled experiments from cognitive science and tests with sponsored online advertisements were conducted to evaluate LLMs' ability to discount biased information and track rational learning models.

Result: LLMs show human-like behavior in controlled settings but struggle in real-world contexts due to distractions. A steering intervention helps improve their alignment with rational models.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit basic sensitivity to motivations, but further advancements are necessary for them to reliably generalize across diverse, realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

*Cesar Gonzalez-Gutierrez,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how prompting impacts internal language model representations in zero-shot tasks and finds the quality of embeddings isn't always tied to the relevance of prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the connection between prompting methods and language model performance in untrained, zero-shot scenarios.

Method: Empirical analysis through probing experiments with various combinations of prompt templates in zero-shot classification tasks.

Result: Prompting affects representation quality, but changes do not always align with the relevance of prompts to specific tasks.

Conclusion: The assumption that relevant prompts yield better representations is challenged and further factors affecting this behavior are explored.

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

*Ashish Chouhan,Michael Gertz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces EUDial, a legal dialogue dataset, and LexGuide, a proactive dialogue framework for improving citizen access to EU legal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between citizens and comprehensible legal resources provided by the European Union, particularly for laypersons struggling with complex texts.

Method: Constructed EUDial, a multi-turn dialogue dataset, and developed LexGuide, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for structured and proactive dialogue navigation.

Result: The proposed solutions improve comprehension and structured access to EU legal information, enhancing citizen interaction with complex legal documents.

Conclusion: EUDial and LexGuide establish effective resources for proactive legal dialogue systems and address the challenges of legal information accessibility.

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

### [96] [Zhyper: Factorized Hypernetworks for Conditioned LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19733)
*M. H. I. Abdalla,Zhipin Wang,Christian Frey,Steffen Eger,Josif Grabocka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zhyper, a parameter-efficient framework for Large Language Model conditioning that generates context-aware LoRA adapters, achieving competitive results with far fewer parameters than alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for conditioning Large Language Models are inefficient and do not fully ensure adherence to desired cultural norms, values, or semantic specifications due to inherent biases in pre-training datasets and alignment techniques.

Method: The authors propose Zhyper, a factorized hypernetwork framework that generates LoRA adapters based on textual descriptions, targeting context-aware conditioning in a parameter-efficient manner.

Result: Zhyper achieves competitive performance on benchmarks, requiring up to 26x fewer parameters than existing methods, and demonstrates better generalization to out-of-domain and fine-grained cultural contexts.

Conclusion: Zhyper provides an effective, parameter-efficient solution for conditioning LLMs. It enhances cultural alignment and contextual understanding while offering significant parameter savings compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

### [97] [SmartSwitch: Advancing LLM Reasoning by Overcoming Underthinking via Promoting Deeper Thought Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19767)
*Xichen Zhang,Sitong Wu,Haoru Tan,Shaozuo Yu,Yinghao Zhu,Ziyi He,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses large language models' tendency to shallowly reason ('underthinking') and proposes the SmartSwitch framework to improve reasoning depth and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often 'underthink' by prematurely moving between thoughts, hindering performance and token efficiency in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The SmartSwitch inference framework detects instances of shallow reasoning by monitoring thought switches and uses a perception module with a reward model to identify promising yet abandoned thoughts. It backtracks and applies deepening prompts to encourage further exploration.

Result: Extensive experiments showed notable performance improvements in mathematical reasoning benchmarks across various large language models.

Conclusion: The SmartSwitch framework effectively mitigates underthinking in large language models, improving reasoning depth and achieving better results and token efficiency.

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

*Yuezhou Hu,Jiaxin Guo,Xinyu Feng,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method called AdaSPEC selectively filters tokens during knowledge distillation to improve token acceptance in large language model inference, enhancing alignment between draft and target models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the suboptimal performance in speculative decoding due to misalignment between draft and target models, caused by conventional knowledge distillation methods that fail to align with speculative decoding's primary goal of maximizing token acceptance rates.

Method: AdaSPEC integrates selective token filtering in knowledge distillation. A reference model filters out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling better alignment between the draft and target models, focusing on simpler tokens to improve acceptance rates.

Result: AdaSPEC achieves consistent improvements over DistillSpec, showing up to a 15% increase in token acceptance rates across various tasks like reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and summarization.

Conclusion: AdaSPEC effectively enhances speculative decoding by increasing alignment between draft and target models, improving token acceptance rates without compromising the quality of generation.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/yuezhouhu/adaspec.

### [99] [Adapting Multilingual Models to Code-Mixed Tasks via Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19782)
*Prashant Kodali,Vaishnavi Shivkumar,Swarang Joshi,Monojit Choudhary,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Manish Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces and evaluates a model merging approach for code-mixed NLP tasks and shows promising results over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of effectively adapting models for code-mixed NLP tasks, leveraging unlabeled code-mixed data and enhancing transferability to low-resource language pairs.

Method: The approach involves continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text, merging with a multilingual base model, and subsequent fine-tuning (FT) on downstream task data. Experiments are conducted on English-Hindi and English-Spanish language pairs using XLM-R and Llama models.

Result: Merged models consistently outperform conventional full fine-tuning and CPT->FT approaches, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores, and demonstrate strong transfer for low-resource language pairs.

Conclusion: Merged checkpoints effectively leverage unlabeled data, outperform conventional and zero-shot techniques in code-mixed contexts, and offer adaptable recipes for specific data regimes with scaling potential.

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

*Saptarshi Sengupta,Zhengyu Zhou,Jun Araki,Xingbo Wang,Bingqing Wang,Suhang Wang,Zhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ToolDreamer, a framework to improve tool retrieval for Large Language Models by generating hypothetical tool descriptions aligned with user queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of retrieving relevant tools for queries when the quantity exceeds the LLM's context limit, traditional methods relying on similarity between queries and tool descriptions often prove suboptimal.

Method: ToolDreamer generates synthetic tool descriptions using LLMs to align with user queries and conditions retriever models to fetch tools based on these hypothetical descriptions. It is tested on the ToolRet dataset.

Result: ToolDreamer enhances performance in both sparse and dense retrievers, showcasing flexibility with and without training.

Conclusion: The framework redistributes reasoning tasks, making retrieval more effective and enabling LLMs to process larger tool sets without surpassing context window limits.

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores improving multilingual performance in large language models (LLMs) through optimized prompt transformations beyond direct translations, achieving notable advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual LLM approaches often rely on translation-based prompts, which impose English-centric framing and neglect cultural and linguistic diversity, limiting model generalization across languages.

Method: The paper introduces a lightweight framework for systematically optimizing translated prompts by transforming them in terms of naturalness, cultural adaptation, and difficulty enhancement, applied across 12 languages from 7 language families.

Result: The proposed framework shows significant improvement in multilingual model performance, achieving +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores XCometXL, and a +35.3% preference win rate on mArenaHard under the same data conditions.

Conclusion: Prompt-space optimization is a simple yet effective strategy to enhance multilingual LLMs, making them more robust, culturally aware, and globally applicable without extensive resource requirements.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scaf-GRPO, a training framework that aims to address the learning cliff phenomenon in reinforcement learning with Large Language Models, achieving significant improvements in model performance on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the limitations of reinforcement learning methods, specifically the inability of models to progress when faced with complex problems due to the 'learning cliff' phenomenon.

Method: Scaf-GRPO implements a progressive training framework that strategically intervenes in model training with tiered in-prompt hints after diagnosing stagnation in learning. This scaffolding enables the model to solve hard problems by guiding it progressively.

Result: Scaf-GRPO improves pass@1 scores of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model by 44.3% on the AIME24 benchmark compared to a baseline approach.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective solution to overcome learning constraints in LLM, demonstrating the potential to expand autonomous reasoning capabilities significantly.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

TL;DR: Hubble introduces open-source LLMs (standard and perturbed) to study memorization risks, revealing key findings on sensitive data exposure and mitigation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scientific research into how large language models memorize training data and the risks associated with sensitive information.

Method: Hubble includes 14 models with standard and artificially perturbed variants, trained with controlled text insertions and varying pretraining corpora sizes.

Result: The memorization of sensitive data is influenced by its frequency relative to corpus size, with further evidence showing forgotten data when exposure is limited.

Conclusion: Diluting sensitive data and prioritizing its early appearance during training are effective practices to mitigate memorization risks; Hubble serves as a valuable testbed for various memorization studies.

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Motivation: The paper is driven by the need to efficiently process large-scale Earth observation data for societal, economic, and environmental applications.

Method: The paper reviews dimensionality reduction methods, specifically feature extraction, to address sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality.

ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [105] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes enable stealthy 6-DoF location tracking using visually modest neural modifications to images, detectable by RGB cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fiducial markers are visually conspicuous, which limits their aesthetic feasibility in environments like augmented reality or robotics.

Method: The method involves a neural encoder network that generates Ninja Codes by subtle alterations to images, followed by training the detection system via deep steganography-inspired techniques.

Result: Experiments show Ninja Codes reliably track locations under indoor settings while blending seamlessly into different textures.

Conclusion: Ninja Codes provide effective and subtle location tracking, offering advantages in scenarios where avoidance of conspicuous markers is preferred.

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [106] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-phase vision-language QA system leveraging multimodal large language models for answering high-level driving-related questions, achieving notable accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reliability and context-awareness of vision-language models for high-level autonomous driving tasks such as perception, prediction, and planning.

Method: The method involves conditioning a large multimodal language model on input data (camera views, history, metadata) and using chain-of-thought prompts, self-consistency ensemble techniques, and category-specific instructions to enhance performance.

Result: The system significantly outperforms Qwen2.5 baseline models, achieving improved driving QA accuracy (67.37% overall) and robust performance under visual corruption (96% accuracy).

Conclusion: Carefully designed prompts and contextual grounding considerably enhance high-level driving QA capabilities of pretrained vision-language models, providing reliable and robust solutions for autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D to efficiently handle irregular temporal sequences of high-resolution medical images for longitudinal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to fully exploit spatio-temporal information in sequences of medical imaging taken at irregular time intervals, necessitating new models for breast cancer risk prediction.

Method: The Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D model is a continuous-time state-space architecture featuring a selective scanning mechanism for temporal encoding and a multi-scale 3D fusion module for spatio-temporal modeling.

Result: The model achieved improved validation c-index (by 2-5 percentage points) and higher AUC scores on breast cancer risk prediction benchmarks compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: This framework is computationally efficient and effective for modeling complex longitudinal medical imaging data, providing advancement in breast cancer risk prediction.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [108] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a motion-centric alignment framework for text-to-video diffusion models, improving motion coherence and physical plausibility in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models often lack the ability to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion due to insufficient understanding of complex motions.

Method: The method learns a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder optimized to predict optical flow. It aligns the latent features of the diffusion model to this motion subspace, enhancing motion understanding.

Result: The proposed method enhances the physical commonsense and temporal coherence of video synthesis, maintaining alignment with textual prompts. Performance is validated using benchmarks such as VideoPhy and VBench.

Conclusion: Aligning text-to-video diffusion model features with a motion-centric subspace improves their ability to generate realistic and physically accurate video sequences.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [109] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PoSh, a metric using scene graphs to evaluate detailed image descriptions, and validates it with a new dataset, DOCENT, which pairs artwork with expert references and human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating image descriptions are unsuitable for long, detailed texts, struggling with fine-grained errors and the complexity of compositional understanding.

Method: The proposed metric, PoSh, employs scene graphs as structured rubrics and utilizes large language models (LLMs) to score detailed image descriptions. DOCENT, the accompanying dataset, features artwork with expert-generated descriptions and granular human quality judgments.

Result: PoSh correlates better (+0.05 Spearman) with human evaluations than alternatives, is robust across image types, and improves model performance compared to traditional fine-tuning, showcasing its potential as a reward function.

Conclusion: PoSh and DOCENT provide a foundation for evaluating and advancing VLMs in generating detailed, accurate image descriptions, especially for complex imagery like artwork.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniHPR, a unified pipeline for learning human pose representations from multiple modalities (images, 2D, and 3D poses) using a novel contrastive learning approach for better alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a coherent and efficient alignment pipeline to unify human pose representations from various modalities for improved performance in downstream tasks like pose estimation, action recognition, and others.

Method: The authors propose a unified pipeline (UniHPR) that aligns embeddings from images, 2D, and 3D human poses using a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss to align data from multiple modalities effectively.

Result: UniHPR achieves impressive results in evaluation tasks such as 3D and 2D human pose estimation, reporting competitive metrics (MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M, PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW, and retrieval error of 9.24mm in MPJPE).

Conclusion: The proposed UniHPR pipeline proves effective in aligning human pose representations across different modalities, enabling improved performance in human pose estimation and retrieval tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Method: The study integrates attention mechanisms into a 3D U-Net architecture for better feature prioritization and uses image processing-based tumor detection algorithms to address data imbalance.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance with notable metrics, achieving dice of 0.975, specificity of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995 on BraTS 2020 dataset.

Conclusion: The integration of attention mechanisms and tumor detection algorithms enhances segmentation reliability, aiding in medical diagnostics and clinical applications.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection and precise diagnosis of breast cancer are critical due to its high mortality rate among women worldwide. Privacy concerns and data sensitivity make it challenging to train accurate AI models without compromising patient data, especially when dealing with non-IID medical data.

Method: The study employs Federated Proximal (FedProx) learning on non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets and proposes a modified U-Net model integrated with attention mechanisms to enhance segmentation accuracy.

Result: The proposed method achieves a global model with 96% accuracy, effectively addressing segmentation challenges while maintaining patient privacy.

Conclusion: The use of FedProx and a modified attention-enhanced U-Net model shows promise for accurate machine learning models in non-IID medical datasets, improving breast cancer segmentation while safeguarding data privacy.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the X-Ego-CS dataset based on first-person gameplay in Counter-Strike 2 for multi-agent decision-making and proposes Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) to improve team-based situational awareness and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of egocentric perspectives in modeling multi-agent tactical decision-making in complex virtual environments, focusing on esports like Counter-Strike 2.

Method: The authors developed the X-Ego-CS dataset containing synchronized first-person gameplay footage along with trajectories. They also proposed Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' visual streams for improved understanding of tactical gameplay.

Result: The CECL approach showed improved performance in predicting teammate and opponent positions from a first-person view, evaluated against state-of-the-art video encoders.

Conclusion: The paper advances multi-agent tactical learning using egocentric perspectives, positioning gameplay as a valuable medium for broader applications in human-AI collaboration and real-world decision-making contexts.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

TL;DR: This paper uses six deep learning convolutional networks to classify blood cells as malaria-infected or healthy, achieving high accuracy with Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malaria diagnosis is currently dependent on manual microscope-based observations, which are prone to errors due to a lack of expertise and manual limitations. Automation through advanced computer-aided methods can improve reliability and efficiency.

Method: The researchers employed six deep learning convolutional networks (AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121, and a custom CNN) to extract features from blood smear images and classify them accordingly.

Result: Among the networks, Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet delivered the highest accuracies, achieving 97.28% and 97.55% respectively. These results surpass existing related methods using the same dataset.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods, specifically Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet, demonstrate potential to make malaria detection more accurate, automated, and less reliant on manual diagnosis.

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PruneHal, a training-free technique using adaptive KV cache pruning to reduce hallucinations in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs arise due to insufficient attention on critical visual tokens, worsened by redundant visual tokens dispersing attention.

Method: PruneHal applies token pruning through adaptive KV cache pruning, enhancing focus on important visual information without extra training or substantial inference costs.

Result: PruneHal effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs, demonstrating robust results across various benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: PruneHal is a simple, model-agnostic approach to reduce hallucinations in MLLMs, requiring minimal computational overhead and integration effort.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric to enhance temporal consistency in video diffusion models, especially for I2V generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward-based fine-tuning methods for video diffusion models focus on improving overall quality, often compromising temporal consistency in generated videos, especially in I2V tasks.

Method: The study proposes VCD, leveraging frequency-domain analysis of video frame features to define temporal consistency, and integrates it within a reward-based fine-tuning framework.

Result: Experiments on multiple I2V datasets show that VCD significantly improves temporal consistency in generated videos without affecting other quality aspects.

Conclusion: Incorporating VCD into video diffusion models effectively resolves temporal coherence challenges in I2V generation, advancing model performance without sacrificing other attributes.

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

Motivation: Address the limitation of existing driving world models focusing solely on generation quality rather than evaluating downstream perception tasks critical for autonomous driving.

Method: Dream4Drive decomposes input videos into 3D-aware guidance maps, renders 3D assets on them, and fine-tunes driving world models for creating photorealistic multi-view videos for training perception models.

Result: The new framework significantly improves corner case perception capabilities, demonstrating performance enhancement in downstream perception models under varied training epochs.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generated through Dream4Drive improves downstream perception tasks, and its flexibility supports generating 3D-aware videos at scale for better autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of

on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

### [119] [MoE-GS: Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19210)
*In-Hwan Jin,Hyeongju Mun,Joonsoo Kim,Kugjin Yun,Kyeongbo Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoE-GS, leveraging multiple experts for dynamic Gaussian splatting to enhance 3D scene reconstruction results across different scenarios. They focus on improving rendering quality and efficiency while ensuring fast processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods using Gaussian Splatting display inconsistent performance across various challenges, suggesting the need for a robust, unified approach.

Method: MoE-GS integrates experts using a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router that projects Gaussian-level weights into pixel space for coherent spatial and temporal rendering. Efficiency improvements include multi-expert rendering and pruning, alongside expert distillation strategies for lightweight deployment.

Result: MoE-GS performs better than current state-of-the-art techniques in both quality and efficiency, demonstrated through experiments on N3V and Technicolor datasets.

Conclusion: MoE-GS introduces Mixture-of-Expert techniques into Gaussian splatting for dynamic applications, achieving enhanced reconstruction quality and speed, with potential for efficient deployment strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

### [120] [SFGFusion: Surface Fitting Guided 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19215)
*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D object detection enhanced through SFGFusion using 4D imaging radar and camera data, overcoming sparse point clouds for improved autonomous driving object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D imaging radar is suitable for autonomous driving due to its advantages, but sparse clouds and low resolution limit object geometry representation and hinder multi-modal fusion.

Method: SFGFusion estimates quadratic surface parameters from image and radar data, enhancing spatial representation and interaction. The network transforms features into BEV space for better fusion and mitigates radar point sparsity using a pseudo-point branch.

Result: SFGFusion achieves superior performance on TJ4DRadSet and VoD benchmarks for object detection, demonstrating effective camera and radar fusion.

Conclusion: Surface fitting in SFGFusion improves spatial accuracy and depth prediction, addressing sparse radar data challenges and advancing multi-modal fusion techniques for object detection.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting GEO space objects in optical imaging by enhancing single-frame features and introducing a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion mechanism with a high F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to accurately detect and track space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), which is hampered by weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental noise.

Method: The authors enhance single-frame detection using wavelet transform and develop a temporal trajectory matching scheme based on the Hungarian algorithm, complemented with noise filtering and trajectory refinement.

Result: The proposed method was evaluated on the SpotGEO dataset, achieving a high F_1 score of 90.14%, demonstrating effectiveness in detection and tracking.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust method for addressing detection challenges of GEO objects by combining optical feature enhancement and advanced temporal trajectory analysis.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

*Yuheng Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Quang Tau,Zhengzhong Tu,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FadeLead, a framework for autonomous vehicles to overcome bandwidth constraints by embedding background context into foreground features, optimizing collaborative perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address bandwidth constraints in vehicular networks while maintaining critical background context for collaborative perception among autonomous vehicles.

Method: FadeLead trains a model to encapsulate background context into foreground features using a curricular learning strategy to progressively remove reliance on transmitting background information.

Result: FadeLead improves collaborative perception capabilities under varying bandwidth settings in both simulated and real-world tests, outperforming existing foreground-centric methods.

Conclusion: FadeLead successfully boosts autonomous vehicle perception reliability by enriching foreground features with essential background context within limited bandwidth constraints.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The survey aims to explore 4D representations to model evolving 3D geometry with motion and interaction, emphasizing the importance of selecting customized representations for specific tasks.

Method: The authors take a selective approach to review representative works on 4D representations, categorized into geometry, motion, and interaction, highlighting advancements and limitations in current methods and AI applications.

Result: The paper identifies key properties and challenges in 4D representations, provides insights into under-explored areas, and examines the limitations of AI models and datasets driving the field.

Conclusion: Readers are guided on how to choose suitable 4D representations for tasks while addressing challenges in data and AI models to push the field forward.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for Real-ISR using a one-step diffusion model enhanced by ControlNet for semantic edge guidance to improve structural integrity and realism without compromising efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Real-ISR models struggle with handling complex degradations and reconstruction ambiguities, especially while balancing perceptual quality and computational cost.

Method: The authors enhance a one-step diffusion model with a ControlNet mechanism to integrate semantic edge guidance, combined with hybrid loss functions (L2, LPIPS, edge-aware AME) for optimizing accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved structural accuracy, realism, and efficiency for Real-ISR models using this proposed framework.

Conclusion: The approach achieves a promising balance between high-quality output and inference speed for Real-world image super-resolution models.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MobiAct, a lightweight MAV action recognition framework that uses MobileNetV4 and innovative techniques to balance accuracy with computational efficiency. It outperforms other methods in speed and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of achieving accurate motion recognition for MAVs while ensuring computational efficiency for resource-limited platforms.

Method: The method includes using MobileNetV4 as the backbone, employing Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD), integrating a parameter-free attention mechanism, and applying a hybrid loss training strategy.

Result: MobiAct achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.12% across datasets, consumes only 136.16 pJ of energy, and processes recognition at 8.84 actions per second, outperforming competitors in speed and efficiency.

Conclusion: MobiAct demonstrates a significant advancement in balancing performance and computational overhead for MAV motion recognition, making it ideal for autonomous aerial swarms.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

*Nobline Yoo,Olga Russakovsky,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), to improve object counting in text-to-image diffusion models by transforming non-differentiable detection models into differentiable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I diffusion models struggle to accurately generate the correct number of objects specified in prompts, due to the limitations of current auxiliary numeracy techniques based on differentiable regression models.

Method: D2D converts detector logits from non-differentiable models into soft binary indicators using custom activation functions, allowing these models to serve as differentiable critics for improving numeracy during the inference process.

Result: Experiments showed up to a 13.7% improvement in object counting accuracy across benchmarks, with minimal impact on image quality or computational requirements.

Conclusion: The D2D framework effectively leverages superior counting capabilities of non-differentiable models, enhancing prompt numeracy generation in T2I diffusion models without significant trade-offs.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models often prove impractical in resource-constrained settings due to their scale, necessitating the development of efficient and powerful alternatives.

Method: RIL combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning, using an LLM-based discriminator and guidance from multiple teacher VLMs to train smaller student VLMs.

Result: RIL significantly narrows the performance gap between lightweight student models and state-of-the-art VLMs, even surpassing leading systems in several benchmarks.

Conclusion: Unified learning strategies like RIL can empower smaller models to attain competitive performance levels with reduced computational costs, promising efficient solutions for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR) for dynamic handwritten signature verification, combining spatial and temporal data for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High accuracy in handwritten signature verification is challenging due to intra-user variability and forgery risks, necessitating better methods.

Method: The proposed TS-GATR models spatial and temporal signature data through Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer module.

Result: TS-GATR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving lower Equal Error Rates (EER) on benchmark datasets like MSDS and DeepSignDB.

Conclusion: The TS-GATR framework successfully enhances signature verification performance by leveraging dynamic graph representations and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net is a multi-task deep learning framework designed to estimate bathymetry and classify seabed features simultaneously, achieving superior performance and accuracy in shallow-water mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current approaches that either predict depth or classify seabed features independently, losing the advantages of their interaction, which is crucial for under-mapped shallow-water environments under environmental and human pressures.

Method: The authors propose Seabed-Net, a dual-branch, multi-task framework using Attention Feature Fusion and Swin-Transformer blocks for integration. The model employs dynamic task weighting to balance the objectives and processes remote sensing imagery for two key tasks: bathymetry prediction and seabed classification.

Result: Seabed-Net significantly outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 75% lower RMSE for bathymetry and improving seabed classification accuracy by up to 8%. It also demonstrates better spatial consistency and depth estimation in challenging regions.

Conclusion: The integration of depth prediction with seabed classification shows synergistic advantages, improving the accuracy and consistency of shallow-water mapping. Seabed-Net offers an open-source, robust solution adaptable to various applications in this domain.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal limitations of current algorithms and validate the efficacy of Catto, providing insights crucial for addressing scale shift in crowd localization.

Conclusion: The research introduces Scale Shift Domain Generalization as an essential area in crowd localization, emphasizing the need for future investigations into novel methodologies and the challenges of scale shift.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

### [133] [BrainMCLIP: Brain Image Decoding with Multi-Layer feature Fusion of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19332)
*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrainMCLIP, a parameter-efficient model that decodes images from fMRI by leveraging intermediate CLIP layers without using a costly VAE pipeline while maintaining or exceeding state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus heavily on the final semantic layer of CLIP and often rely on parameter-intensive VAE pipelines to enhance detail capture. This neglects the hierarchy within CLIP's intermediate layers and doesn't respect the brain's hierarchical visual processing.

Method: BrainMCLIP utilizes a multi-layer fusion approach guided by the functional hierarchy of the human visual system. It aligns fMRI signals from various visual areas to matching CLIP layers and integrates a new Cross-Reconstruction strategy alongside a multi-granularity loss.

Result: BrainMCLIP achieves performance on par with or better than existing methods, especially in high-level semantic metrics, despite reducing parameters by 71.7% compared to VAE-based techniques.

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP effectively captures visual detail and semantic accuracy by focusing on the functional hierarchy and intermediate features of CLIP, providing strong decoding capabilities without the need for a VAE pipeline.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

### [134] [A Training-Free Framework for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation and Recognition with EfficientNet and CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19333)
*Ying Dai,Wei Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free framework for combining segmentation and object recognition, leveraging EfficientNetB0 for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP for open-vocabulary recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition using a training-free approach.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 performs unsupervised segmentation using singular value decomposition and clustering; Stage 2 performs segment-level recognition using vision-language alignment with CLIP embeddings.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results in Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score on benchmarks like COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability for open-vocabulary segmentation and object recognition.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DaMo, a novel optimizer for data mixtures, aimed at enhancing performance of Multimodal Large Language Models in multitasking mobile phone scenarios. It also presents PhoneAgentBench, a benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in simultaneous multitasking across diverse scenarios and the lack of methodologies to determine optimal training data compositions.

Method: The approach involves DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer), a trainable network predicting optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance, and PhoneAgentBench, a benchmark comprising 1235 QA pairs.

Result: The method demonstrated a performance improvement of 3.38% on PhoneAgentBench compared to other techniques. It showed 2.57% better generalization across benchmarks and significantly boosted metrics by 12.47% on BFCL-v3 tasks.

Conclusion: DaMo proves to be highly effective in optimizing data mixtures for multitask learning and maintains scalability across model architectures. The proposed benchmark offers a standardized evaluation platform.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DARE, a novel deformable medical image registration framework emphasizing adaptive regularization for improved accuracy, anatomical plausibility, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional and deep learning medical image registration methods lack adaptive regularization mechanisms, leading to challenges in robustness and ensuring anatomically plausible results.

Method: The paper proposes DARE, which dynamically adjusts elastic regularization using the gradient norm of the deformation field and integrates adaptive strain and shear energy terms. It also includes a folding-prevention mechanism penalizing negative deformation Jacobians.

Result: DARE avoids non-physical artifacts, prevents over-smoothing, and enhances both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility.

Conclusion: DARE effectively balances registration stability and flexibility while delivering robust and anatomically realistic transformations.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

*Zhida Zhao,Talas Fu,Yifan Wang,Lijun Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Policy World Model (PWM), a unified architecture integrating world modeling and trajectory planning, demonstrating superior performance for driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current driving world models focus on simulation, lacking integration with trajectory planning and the synergistic facilitating mechanism for planning.

Method: Introduces PWM, a unified architecture with action-free future state forecasting and collaborative state-action prediction, along with a parallel token generation mechanism for video forecasting.

Result: PWM achieves superior planning performance using only front camera input, surpassing state-of-the-art multi-view and multi-modal input systems.

Conclusion: PWM demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating world modeling and trajectory planning, improving autonomous driving systems, with code and models to be publicly available.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

*Woo Jae Kim,Kyu Beom Han,Yoonki Cho,Youngju Na,Junsik Jung,Sooel Son,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AegisRF, a NeRF framework that uses adversarial perturbations to protect intellectual property while preserving visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to protect the intellectual property of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from unauthorized applications using precise perturbations.

Method: The method consists of two components: Perturbation Field to inject adversarial perturbations and Sensitivity Field to constrain them adaptively, avoiding degradation of rendering quality.

Result: AegisRF successfully generalizes across multiple tasks (e.g., image classification, 3D localization) while maintaining high rendering quality.

Conclusion: AegisRF effectively protects NeRF IP by disrupting unauthorized usage through adversarial perturbations without compromising scene representation quality.

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MV-RoboBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) in robotic manipulation. Findings show a performance gap between humans and VLMs in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating VLMs' ability to integrate multi-view inputs, which are critical for robotic reasoning in complex environments.

Method: Development of MV-RoboBench, incorporating 1.7k QA items across spatial understanding and robotic execution, and evaluating VLMs using this benchmark.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly compared to humans; spatial intelligence correlates with robotic execution, and single-view spatial benchmarks are insufficient for multi-view robotic tasks.

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench highlights challenges in spatial reasoning for VLMs and will support advancements in spatial reasoning and multi-view embodied AI by providing data and standardized evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores an improved method for tracking worker positions in logistics warehouses using 19 wide-angle ceiling cameras, achieving enhanced tracking accuracy by reducing image distortion effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The logistics market growth driven by e-commerce necessitates better warehouse operational efficiency, prompting exploration of technologies like digital twins.

Method: The study aligned camera data based on worker foot positions to mitigate wide-angle image distortions and used multiple cameras for accurate worker tracking.

Result: Tracking accuracy showed over 20% improvement when distortion effects were addressed, validating the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The presented method effectively enhances position tracking in warehouses and improves accuracy across multiple cameras, supporting digital twin applications.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PICK, a framework leveraging MLLMs for psychological analysis via the House-Tree-Person test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore applications of MLLMs in subjective, emotionally complex domains like psychological analysis.

Method: The framework hierarchically analyzes drawings using feature extraction, reinforcement learning, and knowledge injection to create psychological profiles.

Result: PICK enhances MLLMs' performance in psychological tasks and extends to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: PICK bridges the gap between MLLMs and expert psychological domains, enabling structured and interpretable analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in real-world IC defect classification by introducing the IC-Defect-14 dataset and proposing ReCAME-Net, a model that outperforms current classifiers on this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IC defect classification is hindered by highly skewed data distributions and complex features that challenge existing classification techniques.

Method: The authors introduce the IC-Defect-14 dataset with unique properties, and propose ReCAME-Net, utilizing multi-expert classifiers, regional channel attention, metric learning losses, hard category mining, and knowledge distillation.

Result: ReCAME-Net demonstrates superior performance on the IC-Defect-14 dataset compared to state-of-the-art models, while remaining competitive on general datasets.

Conclusion: ReCAME-Net and the challenging IC-Defect-14 dataset provide effective solutions to real-world IC defect classification problems and encourage future research in this area.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework using a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate pore-scale images that match bulk formation properties, addressing challenges of spatial heterogeneity and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulty of obtaining representative pore-scale images due to spatial heterogeneity and limited physical samples from subsurface formations.

Method: A multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained on carbonate thin section samples, conditioned on porosity values and depth, to generate realistic pore-scale images.

Result: The cGAN framework achieved high porosity control (R^2=0.95), low mean absolute errors, and maintained critical pore network features. Generated images showed better representativeness compared to randomly extracted images.

Conclusion: The cGAN framework provides a transformative tool for generating representative subsurface pore-scale images, benefitting applications such as carbon storage, geothermal energy, and digital rock physics.

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

*Juhyung Park,Rokgi Hong,Roh-Eul Yoo,Jaehyeon Koo,Se Young Chun,Seung Hong Choi,Jongho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel AI-based framework for accelerating MRI by predicting target contrast images, significantly reducing acquisition times and improving clinical throughput compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern MRI procedures take a lot of time, limiting their clinical applicability. The motivation behind this study is to overcome these limitations by introducing predictive imaging as an alternative to traditional reconstruction methods.

Method: The authors propose a generative model framework that proactively predicts target contrast images using diverse data inputs, such as other contrast images, patient data, or acquisition parameters. These predicted images serve as priors to reconstruct highly under-sampled MRI data.

Result: The study demonstrates, using 14,921 scans across multiple datasets and acceleration factors (x4, x8, x12), that their method achieves superior performance compared to other techniques, including methods without predictive priors.

Conclusion: The proposed framework marks a paradigm shift in MRI workflows by emphasizing predictive imaging rather than traditional reconstruction processes. It significantly improves efficiency, opening possibilities for broader clinical adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

Motivation: To address the inherent depth ambiguity and limitations of current video-based methods that fail to utilize human movement patterns across sequences.

Method: The PRGCN employs a graph memory bank that stores pose prototypes as relational graphs retrieved via attention mechanisms. It fuses anatomical constraints with these priors through memory-driven graph convolution, supported by a dual-stream hybrid architecture combining state-space models and self-attention.

Result: PRGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance with MPJPE scores of 37.1mm on Human3.6M and 13.4mm on MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks, showcasing improved cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Cross-sequence pattern reuse is essential for advancing 3D human pose estimation, presenting a shift from sequence-specific to cumulative knowledge learning paradigms.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

### [146] [Mitigating representation bias caused by missing pixels in methane plume detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19478)
*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses representation bias in automated feature extraction caused by systematically missing data in satellite images, proposing and evaluating methods like resampling and imputation to mitigate bias and improve methane plume detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring methane plumes via satellite images requires precision, but clouds and other factors create non-random missing pixels that cause biases in detection models, affecting low-coverage image predictions.

Method: This work evaluates imputation methods and introduces a weighted resampling scheme during model training to eliminate the label-coverage association by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin.

Result: Both resampling and imputation significantly reduce representation bias without harming metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall. Debiased models perform better in detecting methane plumes, especially in low-coverage images.

Conclusion: Mitigating biases caused by missing data improves the effectiveness of automated feature detection in challenging scenarios, providing enhanced operational methane plume detection in low-coverage environments.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

*Chen Li,Huiying Xu,Changxin Gao,Zeyu Wang,Yun Liu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of domain generalization in object detection by introducing Cauvis, which employs causal visual prompts and a dual-branch adapter, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve model generalization in unseen target domains for single-source training by overcoming domain discrepancies and spurious correlations in object detection.

Method: The proposed Cauvis method uses a Cross-Attention Prompts module to reduce reliance on spurious features and a dual-branch adapter to disentangle causal and spurious features while enhancing domain adaptation using high-frequency feature analysis.

Result: Cauvis demonstrates state-of-the-art results with a 15.9-31.4% improvement on SDGOD datasets, showing strong robustness in complex environments.

Conclusion: Cauvis effectively tackles spurious correlations and domain shift challenges, showcasing its potential in advancing single-source domain generalized object detection research.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

*Moshe Kimhi,Nimrod Shabtay,Raja Giryes,Chaim Baskin,Eli Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CARES, a module to optimize processing in vision-language models by selecting minimal image resolutions, reducing compute costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in vision-language models caused by processing high-resolution images unnecessarily, leading to increased compute and latency.

Method: Introduces CARES, a lightweight preprocessing module predicting minimal input resolutions needed for effective model performance, using a compact VLM as a feature extractor and classifier.

Result: CARES achieves up to 80% reduction in compute while maintaining task performance, validated across five benchmarks and various vision-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed CARES module optimizes resolution selection, significantly reducing compute requirements without compromising on task accuracy.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs by proposing "Hybrid Video Generation" and feature matching selector methods, which outperform existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing methods for pairwise camera pose estimation, especially on image pairs with sparse or no overlap.

Method: The method involves Hybrid Video Generation (synthesis of clearer intermediate frames combining video interpolation and novel view synthesis) and a Feature Matching Selector to improve pose estimation results.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improvements in pose estimation accuracy, particularly for challenging image pairs with small or no overlap.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly boosts camera pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in visual reasoning tasks, such as counting and spatial relations. Fine-tuning the output layer improves their accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and overcome the reasoning limitations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly in tasks like counting objects and analyzing spatial arrangements.

Method: Analyzing reasoning failures in seven state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled conditions, performing layer-wise analysis, and fine-tuning the output layer to improve accuracy.

Result: The study found VLMs are sensitive to object type, spatial arrangement, and distractors. Fine-tuning the output layer improved accuracy by up to 21%, with consistent performance enhancements on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in VLMs is achievable through targeted adjustments, particularly in the output layer, which improves their overall performance on complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

### [151] [The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores how prompt complexity impacts the utility of synthetic data generated by text-to-image models, analyzing its effects on factors like diversity, consistency, and distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data generation through text-to-image (T2I) models has great potential to overcome limitations in finite real datasets. Understanding how prompt complexity impacts synthetic data quality and utility is crucial.

Method: The authors conduct synthetic experiments, provide theoretical explanations, introduce an evaluation framework, and perform large-scale empirical tests across diverse datasets to study how prompt complexity influences synthetic data characteristics.

Result: Results indicate that complex prompts worsen conditional diversity and prompt consistency but reduce synthetic-to-real distribution shifts. Prompt expansion using language models enhances performance, surpassing real data in terms of image diversity and aesthetics.

Conclusion: Prompt complexity has a systematic impact on synthetic data utility and characteristics. Purposeful interventions like prompt expansion improve diversity and aesthetics, making them key to leveraging T2I models effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

TL;DR: This paper examines how large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP process temporal information, presenting TIME10k dataset and proposing timeline-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to evaluate and improve the ability of VLMs to interpret visual content with respect to time, expanding their utility in temporal reasoning tasks.

Method: They introduce the TIME10k dataset with 10,000 images containing temporal ground truth, and assess 37 VLMs using a novel evaluation methodology. They also propose timeline representations derived from the embedding space.

Result: Temporal information in VLMs was found to be structured in a low-dimensional manifold, and proposed timeline-based methods delivered competitive or superior accuracy over baselines.

Conclusion: Temporal reasoning can be effectively facilitated in VLMs using timeline representations, confirming their potential for chronological tasks and establishing a resource (TIME10k) for future research.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

### [153] [HAD: Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation to Bridge Spatio-Temporal Gaps in Event-Based Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19560)
*Yao Deng,Xian Zhong,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu,Jingling Yuan,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HAD (Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation), a framework for integrating RGB and event camera modalities, overcoming their spatio-temporal asymmetries for effective multi-modal object tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance object tracking under challenging conditions (e.g., high-speed motion, HDR environments, dynamic backgrounds) by utilizing complementary strengths of RGB and event cameras while addressing their spatio-temporal asymmetry.

Method: The paper proposes HAD, a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that uses hierarchical alignment strategies to reduce information loss and optimize computational and parameter efficiency in the student network.

Result: HAD consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in experiments, with ablation studies confirming the importance and efficacy of its components.

Conclusion: HAD mitigates the integration challenges of RGB and event cameras, providing a robust framework for multi-modal tracking; future release of the code promises further impact.

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first no-box adversarial attack method, { }-Cloak, targeting object detectors via manipulation of the alpha channel in RGBA videos. This attack achieves a 100% success rate and remains visually imperceptible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the security of object detection models against adversarial threats, particularly in video domains, where vulnerabilities remain largely unexplored.

Method: Utilization of the alpha channel to fuse malicious and benign videos into one that deceives object detectors while appearing innocuous to human viewers. Evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art detectors and other models.

Result: Demonstrated 100% attack success rate on five object detectors, a vision-language model, and Gemini-2.0-Flash multimodal large language model.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical vulnerability in video-based perception systems and stresses the need for defenses addressing alpha channel manipulation in adversarial settings.

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD), a novel feed-forward framework for autonomous driving scene reconstruction, improving generalization and novel view quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of ensuring geometric consistency and reconstruction quality of novel views in autonomous driving scenes with minimal overlap regions.

Method: The VGD framework includes a lightweight VGGT variant for geometric estimation, a Gaussian Head for multi-scale geometry fusion, and a semantic refinement model for optimized rendering.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show VGD surpasses state-of-the-art methods in metrics and subjective quality for surround-view scene rendering.

Conclusion: Visual Gaussian Driving delivers superior scalability and fidelity in reconstructing autonomous driving scenes using feed-forward techniques.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-modal co-learning framework for Earth Observation that enhances single-modality models by using sensor-derived data during training, addressing inference-stage convenience and achieving better results than current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth Observation data presents challenges due to the complexity of accessing the same sensor modalities at both training and inference stages. Researchers aim to leverage training-stage data to improve single-modality inference.

Method: The framework integrates contrastive and modality discriminative learning, separating modality-shared from modality-specific information to aid single-modality models during inference.

Result: The framework was tested on four benchmarks covering classification and regression tasks. It showed consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in single-modality inference across various Earth Observation applications.

Conclusion: The findings confirm the framework’s effectiveness in diverse EO scenarios, providing a generalized solution for enhancing single-modality predictive capabilities without targeting specific modalities.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical

evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

### [160] [Decomposed Attention Fusion in MLLMs for Training-Free Video Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19592)
*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a training-free approach for video object segmentation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), proposing a Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF) method to refine noisy attention maps and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current MLLMs in video reasoning and segmentation, where attention maps are often noisy and poorly aligned with object regions, and to develop a training-free method for effective video object segmentation.

Method: The study proposes Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which enhances attention map quality through contrastive object-background fusion and complementary video-frame fusion. Additionally, it introduces attention-guided SAM2 prompting for fine-grained mask generation, avoiding retraining of the models.

Result: DecAF improves attention maps, suppresses irrelevant activations, and enables the direct conversion of focus into segmentation masks. It outperforms other training-free methods and achieves performance equivalent to training-based methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: DecAF successfully demonstrates that a training-free and efficient refinement mechanism can achieve high-quality video object segmentation using existing MLLMs, bridging the gap between training-free and training-based approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

### [161] [CBDiff:Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Models for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19597)
*Zhou Lei,Pan Gang,Wang Jiahao,Sun Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff), which enhances image forgery localization by generating diverse and plausible forgery maps to address uncertainty in tampered regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image forgery localization methods produce deterministic maps that lack precision and reliability, limiting their use in forensic and security applications.

Method: The CBDiff model incorporates Bernoulli noise and a Time-Step Cross-Attention mechanism to generate diverse and faithful forgery localization maps guided by semantic features and temporal steps.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmark datasets show CBDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in forgery localization performance.

Conclusion: CBDiff proves its effectiveness in improving forgery localization and holds promise for real-world forensic and surveillance applications.

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

*Haozhe Luo,Shelley Zixin Shu,Ziyu Zhou,Sebastian Otalora,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks interpretability of vision-language models (VLMs) in chest X-rays, revealing challenges in grounding small or diffuse pathologies and emphasizing the need for targeted benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable grounding in vision-language models is crucial for clinical interpretability and adoption in the medical domain.

Method: The authors benchmark cross-modal interpretability across seven CLIP-style VLM variants by generating visual explanations and assessing alignment with radiologist annotations.

Result: VLMs show good localization for well-defined large pathologies but struggle with small or diffuse lesions. Models trained on chest X-ray datasets perform better in alignment.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack clinically reliable grounding despite good recognition abilities, necessitating specific interpretability benchmarks for medical practice.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

### [163] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores a denoising method using harmonic analysis techniques, specifically wavelet scattering coefficients, to address suboptimal sparse estimators in frames for complex signal regularities. It achieves minimax bounds for image denoising and bridges harmonic analysis and deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore improved methods for signal denoising, specifically for cartoon images with complex geometric regularities where traditional sparse estimators fall short. The focus is on achieving minimax bounds for better adaptability to unknown parameters like the Lipschitz exponent.

Method: An innovative denoising estimator is introduced by jointly minimising and maximising the $1$ norms of different subsets of wavelet scattering coefficients. These coefficients are simplified versions of convolutional neural network models, computed with a second wavelet transform.

Result: The new method achieves minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images with Lipschitz exponents $1 \leq 2$. Numerical experiments verify the performance and geometric regularity capture in the image structure.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel harmonic analysis approach for effective noise suppression and improved denoising estimators. It establishes a connection between harmonic analysis and deep convolutional network techniques, fostering new directions in signal processing research.

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GenComm, a mechanism to improve collaboration between heterogeneous agents in multi-agent systems by generating and aligning features without altering the original network. It achieves significant computational efficiency while outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges posed by domain gaps in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, such as intrusive retraining disrupting consistency and scalability impeded by high computational costs.

Method: The paper introduces GenComm, utilizing a Generative Communication mechanism including a Deformable Message Extractor for spatial messages extraction and a Spatial-Aware Feature Generator applying a conditional diffusion model to ensure semantic and spatial alignment. Additionally, a Channel Enhancer refines generated features before fusion.

Result: Experimental results on OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X, and V2X-Real datasets reveal GenComm's superiority by reducing computational cost and parameter count by 81% while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GenComm effectively addresses scalability and domain gap challenges in multi-agent collaboration, providing seamless perception and efficient integration of heterogeneous agents without reconfigurations to the original network.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

### [165] [Augmenting Moment Retrieval: Zero-Dependency Two-Stage Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19622)
*Zhengxuan Wei,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework, AMR, to enhance moment retrieval by addressing data scarcity, boundary ambiguity, and fine-grained semantic discrimination without requiring external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing moment retrieval methods struggle with data limitations, ambiguous boundaries, and difficulties in distinguishing fine-grained semantics. This highlights the need for models that can improve without relying on external data or manual annotations.

Method: The authors designed AMR with two key principles: resolving annotation ambiguities and improving generalization through two stages of training. The cold-start stage uses curriculum learning for foundational boundary and semantic understanding, while the distillation stage aligns query sets to enhance real-world applicability.

Result: AMR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments across various benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: AMR effectively enhances moment retrieval performance by addressing key limitations in prior methods and ensuring robustness without external dependencies.

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

*Yifan Li,Fenghe Tang,Yingtai Li,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MedReason-R1, a medical vision-language model with reasoning abilities and zoom-in disease-specific analysis, achieving state-of-the-art CT diagnosis performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large Vision-Language Models perform poorly in the medical field due to a lack of specialized datasets and insufficient focus on diagnostic reasoning.

Method: The authors develop CT-RATE-VQA dataset and propose MedReason-R1, equipped with zoom-in disease-specific analysis combined with GRPO reinforcement learning for better diagnostic reasoning.

Result: MedReason-R1 outperforms current general-purpose and medical models in CT disease diagnosis, balancing accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed model and dataset advance medical imaging diagnostics significantly, providing an effective reasoning mechanism without needing extensive manual annotations.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,
checkpoints, and dataset are available at:

### [167] [Re-Activating Frozen Primitives for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19653)
*Yuxin Cheng,Binxiao Huang,Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Graziano Chesi,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReAct-GS, a method to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting for complex scenes, eliminating artifacts and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with artifacts in complex scenes due to limitations like gradient magnitude dilution and trapped Gaussian scaling.

Method: ReAct-GS incorporates an importance-aware densification criterion and a re-activation mechanism to address the artifacts.

Result: The method successfully eliminates artifacts, achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthesis metrics, and is compatible with other variants like Pixel-GS.

Conclusion: ReAct-GS enhances geometric detail preservation and broad applicability in 3D Gaussian methods for real-time novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

*John Burden,Jonathan Prunty,Ben Slater,Matthieu Tehenan,Greg Davis,Lucy Cheke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates visual processing in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by adapting visual search paradigms from cognitive psychology, revealing human-like perceptual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms of visual processing in MLLMs, moving beyond task accuracy metrics.

Method: The authors adapt visual search paradigms from cognitive psychology, using controlled experiments with features like color, size, and lighting to test perceptual capabilities in MLLMs.

Result: Advanced MLLMs display pop-out effects and perceptual behaviors akin to humans, including sensitivity to salient features and natural scene priors.

Conclusion: The study establishes visual search as a grounded diagnostic tool for analyzing and improving perceptual processing in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

*Zihao Chen,Yi Zhou,Xudong Jiang,Li Chen,Leopold Schmetterer,Bingyao Tan,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unpaired image-to-image translation often fails to preserve fine curvilinear structures in medical imaging. The paper proposes CST, a framework enhancing such preservation, improving fidelity and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unpaired image-to-image translation methods distort fine curvilinear structures, critical in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, reducing diagnostic reliability.

Method: The CST framework incorporates a curvilinear extraction module for structure preservation, augmenting baseline models like CycleGAN and UNSB for improved training.

Result: CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance across optical coherence tomography angiography, color fundus, and X-ray coronary angiography modalities.

Conclusion: CST provides a robust approach for curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation, advancing medical imaging fidelity.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ensemble-CAM, a technique offering visual explanations for decisions made by deep learning-based face presentation attack detection (PAD) systems to improve transparency and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security threats posed by biometric presentation attacks and the opaque nature of deep learning models used in PAD systems.

Method: The novel Ensemble-CAM approach is developed to generate visual explanations, identifying key regions affecting biometric image classification in PAD systems.

Result: Ensemble-CAM successfully provides insights into the decision-making of DL-based PAD systems, increasing understanding and trust in these models.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the interpretability of DL-based PAD systems, thereby improving user trust and system transparency in biometric security applications.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LyTimeT, a framework for extracting meaningful variables from video data by employing spatio-temporal attention and stability constraints to ensure robust latent variable learning, accurate predictions, and physical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to simplify the extraction of true dynamical variables from complex video data by mitigating distractions such as background motion, occlusions, and texture changes, which are challenging for modeling dynamical systems.

Method: The LyTimeT framework operates in two phases: (1) Using a spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder with global attention for distraction-robust latent variable extraction and video prediction; (2) Refining latent space by selecting meaningful dimensions through correlation analysis and enforcing stability constraints using a Lyapunov regularizer.

Result: Across synthetic and real-world systems, LyTimeT achieves superior performance in retaining meaningful latent information, exhibiting invariance to background perturbations, and obtaining the lowest error rates compared to CNN and transformer-only approaches.

Conclusion: LyTimeT demonstrates that incorporating spatio-temporal attention and stability regularization leads to dynamical system models that are both interpretable and highly predictive, enhancing our ability to analyze complex dynamics.

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

*Shaohang Jia,Zhiyong Huang,Zhi Yu,Mingyang Hou,Shuai Miao,Han Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ) introduces a novel framework for mixed-precision quantization by addressing challenges in activation distribution and weight quantization. It achieves greater accuracy and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization-aware training methods struggle with non-uniform activation distributions and mismatched static codebooks for weight quantization in constrained hardware environments.

Method: ADQ utilizes a quantile-based initialization, EMA-based dynamic codebook adaptation, mixed-precision strategies, and a hardware-friendly mapping scheme for activations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ADQ achieves 71.512% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 2.81 average bit-width for ResNet-18, outperforming current methods. Ablation studies on CIFAR-10 confirm its robust design.

Conclusion: ADQ effectively improves quantization-aware training by dynamically aligning weight distributions, mixed-precision strategies, and accommodating hardware constraints, leading to superior performance.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X is a multimodal framework for versatile human motion generation using a diffusion transformer and novel conditioning like reference motion, while leveraging the OmniMoCap-X dataset for training and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in realistic and consistent human motion generation across diverse multimodal tasks while overcoming conflicts within training and improving temporal consistency.

Method: The paper introduces an autoregressive diffusion transformer with sequence-to-sequence architecture, proposes reference motion as conditioning, employs a progressive training strategy, constructs OmniMoCap-X dataset, and uses GPT-4o for annotations.

Result: OmniMotion-X surpasses current methods in diverse multimodal tasks with state-of-the-art performance and enables coherent and controllable long-duration motion generation.

Conclusion: The framework establishes itself as a significant advancement in human motion generation, supporting multiple applications and providing high-quality, interactive outputs.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,

*Xiaozhen Qiao,Jingkai Zhao,Yuqiu Jiang,Xianda Guo,Zhe Sun,Hongyuan Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CPL-NC, a TTA framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing prototype degradation and class confusion during distribution shifts using Class-Aware Prototype Cache and Negative Contrastive Learning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face performance drops during deployment when the test data distribution differs from the training data distribution. Existing TTA methods fail to account for challenges like prototype degradation and confusion between semantically similar classes.

Method: CPL-NC, the proposed framework, includes two key components: 1) Class-Aware Prototype Cache to adjust class capacity dynamically and maintain rare-category knowledge, and 2) Negative Contrastive Learning Mechanism to constrain hard visual-textual negatives for better class separability.

Result: Experiments across 15 benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of CPL-NC compared to previous TTA methods using ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: CPL-NC effectively enhances VLMs' test-time adaptability under distribution shifts, resolving prototype degradation and class confusion challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

TL;DR: The Pico-Banana-400K dataset provides 400K real image edit pairs to advance text-guided image editing, with systematic quality measures and specialized subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current progress in text-guided image editing is hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality open datasets from real images.

Method: The dataset was created by using Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from the OpenImages collection, employing a fine-grained taxonomy, MLLM-based quality scoring, and detailed curation.

Result: The dataset contains 400K image edit pairs along with specialized subsets for multi-turn editing, preference modeling, and instruction rewriting, enabling complex editing research.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K sets a new foundation for training and evaluating image editing models by providing a comprehensive and diverse dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a detailed analysis of existing metrics for monocular depth estimation, revealing deficiencies and proposing improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation lacks evaluation standardization, and current metrics exhibit unclear trade-offs and behaviors when assessing results.

Method: The paper evaluates existing metrics' sensitivity to perturbations and introduces a new metric based on relative surface normals alongside improved visualization tools.

Result: Existing metrics are found inadequate in detecting curvature perturbations. The proposed metric aligns better with human judgment and improves evaluation robustness.

Conclusion: New metrics and tools improve monocular depth evaluation, addressing under-sensitivity issues and enhancing alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Motivation: The paper aims to improve the accuracy and performance of optical character recognition (OCR) systems, with a focus on converting complex digitized print documents into clean plain text.

Method: The method involves using a specialized 7B vision language model trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Synthetic documents with known ground-truth HTML source are used to create diverse unit tests for training.

Result: olmOCR 2 demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in OCR tasks on challenging layouts like math formulas, table parsing, and multi-column documents in the olmOCR-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: olmOCR 2 significantly advances OCR technology and sets a new benchmark for handling complex layout documents; the model, data, and codes are openly released for broader use.

Abstract: We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for
converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered
plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision

rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To
scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic
documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source
code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases
results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language
OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table
parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to adequately capture real-world challenges like motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity.

Method: Developed ITTO, a benchmark suite sourced from diverse videos with high-quality human annotations, and conducted performance analysis of existing tracking methods.

Result: State-of-the-art tracking methods face significant challenges with motion complexity, occlusion handling, and point re-identification.

Conclusion: Existing methods require improved modeling for real-world dynamics, and ITTO could help advance robust tracking algorithm development.

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking

### [179] [CodeCRDT: Observation-Driven Coordination for Multi-Agent LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18893)
*Sergey Pugachev*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CodeCRDT introduces a coordination method for multi-agent LLM systems based on shared state monitoring instead of message passing, enabling conflict-free code generation with deterministic consistency and revealing performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in parallel speedups for multi-agent LLM systems caused by expensive coordination mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose CodeCRDT, leveraging Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to enable lock-free concurrent coordination based on shared state monitoring and deterministic convergence.

Result: CodeCRDT exhibits up to 21.1% speedup in some tasks, up to 39.4% slowdown in others, and achieves 100% convergence with no merge failures, depending on the task structure.

Conclusion: Observation-driven coordination through CodeCRDT can enhance performance in certain scenarios while revealing meaningful trade-offs between speed, semantic conflict rates, and system consistency in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems fail to realize parallel speedups due to costly
coordination. We present CodeCRDT, an observation-driven coordination pattern
where agents coordinate by monitoring a shared state with observable updates
and deterministic convergence, rather than explicit message passing. Using
Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), CodeCRDT enables lock-free,
conflict-free concurrent code generation with strong eventual consistency.
Evaluation across 600 trials (6 tasks, 50 runs per mode) shows both benefits
and trade-offs: up to 21.1% speedup on some tasks, up to 39.4% slowdown on
others, and 100% convergence with zero merge failures. The study formalizes
observation-driven coordination for stochastic LLM agents, revealing semantic
conflict rates (5-10%) and quality-performance tradeoffs, and provides
empirical characterization of when parallel coordination succeeds versus fails
based on task structure.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The study combines LLM-generated policy design with simulation-based verification for distributed systems, showing preliminary improvements in throughput and discussing next steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI can enhance distributed systems policy design by leveraging LLMs for generating policies and simulators for verification.

Method: Framework employs an iterative process where LLMs generate Python policies, simulated using a domain-specific tool, and then structured feedback refines the designs.

Result: Preliminary results show throughput improvements across models, with observations on effectiveness and limitations.

Conclusion: AI presents promising potential for scaling this methodology, including bootstrapping simulators, albeit current setup limitations exist.

Abstract: We explore AI-driven distributed-systems policy design by combining
stochastic code generation from large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
verification in a domain-specific simulator. Using a Function-as-a-Service
runtime (Bauplan) and its open-source simulator (Eudoxia) as a case study, we
frame scheduler design as an iterative generate-and-verify loop: an LLM
proposes a Python policy, the simulator evaluates it on standardized traces,
and structured feedback steers subsequent generations. This setup preserves
interpretability while enabling targeted search over a large design space. We
detail the system architecture and report preliminary results on throughput
improvements across multiple models. Beyond early gains, we discuss the limits
of the current setup and outline next steps; in particular, we conjecture that
AI will be crucial for scaling this methodology by helping to bootstrap new
simulators.

*Ivan Borodii,Illia Fedorovych,Halyna Osukhivska,Diana Velychko,Roman Butsii*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study compares the efficiency of Java, Python, and Scala programming languages for large dataset processing using Apache Spark across ETL workflows involving Apache Iceberg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive performance comparisons for full ETL workflows in Apache Spark across different programming languages.

Method: Multiple operations in Apache Spark were tested, including data loading, transformation, and integration into Apache Iceberg tables using CSV files of varying sizes.

Result: Python excelled in processing small datasets (5MB), while Scala and Java performed better on larger datasets (1.6GB) and complex operations. Performance results showed Python being faster for small-scale data handling.

Conclusion: Programming language choice affects Apache Spark's efficiency. Python suits smaller data tasks well, while Scala and Java perform better in large-scale or complex operations. Findings help optimize workflows based on dataset size and performance needs.

Abstract: During the study, the results of a comparative analysis of the process of
handling large datasets using the Apache Spark platform in Java, Python, and
Scala programming languages were obtained. Although prior works have focused on
individual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across
programming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was
performed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV
files, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It
was found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly
depending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When
processing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71
seconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of
9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming
languages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in
Python: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56
seconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved
combining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an
Apache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42
seconds. Java processing was completed in 379.8 seconds, while Python was the
least efficient, with a runtime of 398.32 seconds. It follows that the
programming language significantly affects the efficiency of data processing by
the Apache Spark algorithm, with Scala and Java being more productive for
processing large amounts of data and complex operations, while Python
demonstrates an advantage in working with small amounts of data. The results
obtained can be useful for optimizing data handling processes depending on
specific performance requirements and the amount of information being
processed.

### [182] [On the Randomized Locality of Matching Problems in Regular Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19151)
*Seri Khoury,Manish Purohit,Aaron Schild,Joshua Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores the locality of matching problems in regular graphs, developing efficient algorithms for approximate matching and presenting lower bounds for locality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the locality needed for nodes to achieve distributed symmetry-breaking solutions in graph problems.

Method: The authors employ randomized algorithms for approximate matching and introduce a novel martingale-based analysis, particularly applied to Luby's algorithm.

Result: Approximate matching in regular graphs depends only on ε, independent of graph size or degree, with logarithmic dependence on 1/ε for larger degrees. Distinction between node-averaged and worst-case complexity in maximal matching is established.

Conclusion: Approximate matching in regular graphs is highly local, showcasing the sharp contrast with maximal matching which requires global considerations. This suggests deeper insights into distributed graph algorithm complexities.

Abstract: The main goal in distributed symmetry-breaking is to understand the locality
of problems; i.e., the radius of the neighborhood that a node needs to explore
in order to arrive at its part of a global solution. In this work, we study the
locality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of
the main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of
symmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.
For approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +
\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the
locality depends only on $\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph
parameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\Delta$ is not very small
(namely, as long as $\Delta \geq \text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$), this dependence is
only logarithmic in $1/\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal
matching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of
nodes $n$ or the degree $\Delta$. We show matching lower bounds for both
results. For maximal matching, our techniques further allow us to establish a
strong separation between the node-averaged complexity and worst-case
complexity of maximal matching in regular graphs, by showing that the former is
only $O(1)$. Central to our main technical contribution is a novel
martingale-based analysis for the $\approx 40$-year-old algorithm by Luby. In
particular, our analysis shows that applying one round of Luby's algorithm on
the line graph of a $\Delta$-regular graph results in an almost
$\Delta/2$-regular graph.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces RLBoost, a system for cost-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) training using preemptible GPU resources to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource tension in RL workflows and leverage preemptible GPU resources for cost-saving opportunities.

Method: RLBoost adopts a hybrid architecture with three techniques: adaptive rollout offload, pull-based weight transfer, and token-level response collection and migration.

Result: RLBoost achieves 1.51x-1.97x increased training throughput and improves cost efficiency by 28%-49% compared to on-demand GPU resources alone.

Conclusion: RLBoost offers an effective solution for accelerating RL training and enhancing cost efficiency by utilizing preemptible GPU resources.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become essential for unlocking advanced
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). RL workflows involve
interleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource
requirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales
efficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training
requires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL
frameworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated
architectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing
both stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without
modifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource
under-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances
on public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant
cost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently
harvested for rollout.
  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient
RL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that
rollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with
preemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these
resources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost
adopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout
offload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,
(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available
instances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient
preemption handling and continuous load balancing. Extensive experiments show
RLBoost increases training throughput by 1.51x-1.97x while improving cost
efficiency by 28%-49% compared to using only on-demand GPU resources.

*Heng Xu,Zhiwei Yu,Chengze Du,Ying Zhou,Letian Li,Haojie Wang,Weiqiang Cheng,Jialong Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RailS is a load-balancing framework that optimizes MoE training by leveraging Rail architecture's topology to minimize all-to-all communication time, improving bandwidth and iteration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The imbalanced and sparse all-to-all communication in training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models leads to inefficiencies, especially given conventional load-balancing limitations in Rail architectures.

Method: RailS introduces a distributed load-balancing framework that utilizes Rail topology's symmetry to ensure uniform load distribution. It employs local Longest Processing Time First (LPT) scheduling and multipath transmission across N parallel rails.

Result: RailS improves bus bandwidth by 20%-78% and reduces completion time by 17%-78% for synthetic and real-world MoE workloads. It reduces iteration time in Mixtral workloads by 18%-40% while achieving near-optimal load balancing.

Conclusion: RailS fully utilizes architectural parallelism in distributed MoE training, enhancing performance through topology-aware scheduling and communication optimization.

Abstract: Training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models introduces sparse and highly
imbalanced all-to-all communication that dominates iteration time. Conventional
load-balancing methods fail to exploit the deterministic topology of Rail
architectures, leaving multi-NIC bandwidth underutilized. We present RailS, a
distributed load-balancing framework that minimizes all-to-all completion time
in MoE training. RailS leverages the Rail topology's symmetry to prove that
uniform sending ensures uniform receiving, transforming global coordination
into local scheduling. Each node independently executes a Longest Processing
Time First (LPT) spraying scheduler to proactively balance traffic using local
information. RailS activates N parallel rails for fine-grained, topology-aware
multipath transmission. Across synthetic and real-world MoE workloads, RailS
improves bus bandwidth by 20%--78% and reduces completion time by 17%--78%. For
Mixtral workloads, it shortens iteration time by 18%--40% and achieves
near-optimal load balance, fully exploiting architectural parallelism in
distributed training.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLASH Viterbi and FLASH-BS Viterbi, two innovative algorithms designed to optimize Viterbi decoding for resource-constrained systems. They enhance time and memory efficiency, adaptability, and compatibility with hardware accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing migration of Viterbi decoding workloads to resource-constrained edge platforms, requiring optimized computational efficiency, memory usage, and adaptability.

Method: The authors propose a non-recursive divide-and-conquer strategy combined with pruning, parallelization techniques, and dynamic tuning of parameters. Additionally, the development of FPGA-based hardware accelerators ensures practical deployment.

Result: The algorithms outperform existing baselines in decoding time, memory efficiency, adaptability, and hardware compatibility. Extensive experiments validate these improvements.

Conclusion: FLASH Viterbi algorithms are effective and efficient solutions for structured sequence inference in modern data systems, addressing computational and resource constraints while offering adaptable solutions for diverse platforms.

Abstract: The Viterbi algorithm is a key operator for structured sequence inference in
modern data systems, with applications in trajectory analysis, online
recommendation, and speech recognition. As these workloads increasingly migrate
to resource-constrained edge platforms, standard Viterbi decoding remains
memory-intensive and computationally inflexible. Existing methods typically
trade decoding time for space efficiency, but often incur significant runtime
overhead and lack adaptability to various system constraints. This paper
presents FLASH Viterbi, a Fast, Lightweight, Adaptive, and Hardware-Friendly
Viterbi decoding operator that enhances adaptability and resource efficiency.
FLASH Viterbi combines a non-recursive divide-and-conquer strategy with pruning
and parallelization techniques to enhance both time and memory efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained data systems.To further decouple
space complexity from the hidden state space size, we present FLASH-BS Viterbi,
a dynamic beam search variant built on a memory-efficient data structure. Both
proposed algorithms exhibit strong adaptivity to diverse deployment scenarios
by dynamically tuning internal parameters.To ensure practical deployment on
edge devices, we also develop FPGA-based hardware accelerators for both
algorithms, demonstrating high throughput and low resource usage. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithms consistently outperform existing baselines
in both decoding time and memory efficiency, while preserving adaptability and
hardware-friendly characteristics essential for modern data systems. All codes

### [186] [HybridEP: Scaling Expert Parallelism to Cross-Datacenter Scenario via Hybrid Expert/Data Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19470)
*Weihao Yang,Hao Huang,Donglei Wu,Ningke Li,Yanqi Pan,Qiyang Zheng,Wen Xia,Shiyi Li,Qiang Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces HybridEP, a framework aiming to optimize Expert Parallelism (EP) in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture under constrained bandwidth, achieving significant scalability improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing scale of Mixture-of-Experts models requires cross-data-center (DC) training paradigms, but expert parallelism (EP) faces scalability issues due to bandwidth limitations.

Method: HybridEP dynamically adjusts expert placement using a stream-based model to optimize communication patterns. It uses domain-based partitioning and parameter-efficient migration techniques to reduce communication overhead.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that HybridEP provides up to 5.6x improvement over existing systems and 1.45x speedup in simulations with 1,000 DCs under different bandwidth constraints.

Conclusion: HybridEP proves to be a scalable optimization for EP in MoE architectures, addressing critical cross-DC communication issues effectively.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a popular architecture for scaling large
models. However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single
DC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under
this, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due
to the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations
attempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit
in low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.
Therefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical
roadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.
  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize
EP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the
spatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and
frequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is
non-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original
communication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore
build a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided
by this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct
the mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU
level, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by
reducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining
all these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better
scalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing
state-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained
bandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.
HybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces Propius, a novel system designed to address challenges in scalable and efficient resource management for collaborative machine learning, offering superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of scalable and reusable infrastructure for collaborative ML systems, enabling better resource management to tackle growing data privacy, communication, and model heterogeneity challenges.

Method: The authors propose Propius, a system with a control plane for resource sharing and a data plane for model sharing and result collection, designed for scalability and efficiency in collaborative ML.

Result: Propius significantly outperforms existing techniques in resource utilization (up to 1.88×), throughput (up to 2.76×), and job completion time (up to 1.26×).

Conclusion: Propius proves to be an efficient and scalable solution for collaborative ML infrastructure, addressing existing system limitations and providing better resource management for multi-tenant environments.

Abstract: Collaborative Machine Learning is a paradigm in the field of distributed
machine learning, designed to address the challenges of data privacy,
communication overhead, and model heterogeneity. There have been significant
advancements in optimization and communication algorithm design and ML hardware
that enables fair, efficient and secure collaborative ML training. However,
less emphasis is put on collaborative ML infrastructure development. Developers
and researchers often build server-client systems for a specific collaborative
ML use case, which is not scalable and reusable. As the scale of collaborative
ML grows, the need for a scalable, efficient, and ideally multi-tenant resource
management system becomes more pressing. We propose a novel system, Propius,
that can adapt to the heterogeneity of client machines, and efficiently manage
and control the computation flow between ML jobs and edge resources in a
scalable fashion. Propius is comprised of a control plane and a data plane. The
control plane enables efficient resource sharing among multiple collaborative
ML jobs and supports various resource sharing policies, while the data plane
improves the scalability of collaborative ML model sharing and result
collection. Evaluations show that Propius outperforms existing resource
management techniques and frameworks in terms of resource utilization (up to
$1.88\times$), throughput (up to $2.76$), and job completion time (up to

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a production blueprint for using serverless GPUs and TabNet to improve efficiency, compliance, and interpretability in regulated environments, offering significant performance and cost benefits compared to traditional Spark and CPU frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations require data analytics solutions that are efficient, cost-effective, and compliant, especially in latency-sensitive, regulated environments.

Method: The study introduces a Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) framework combining serverless GPU runtimes and the TabNet ML model for interpretable analyses.

Result: Benchmarks demonstrate that GPU pipelines significantly outperform Spark and CPU baselines in throughput, latency, and cost. Compliance mechanisms have minimal latency impact, ensuring consistent interpretability under load.

Conclusion: Serverless GPU-based analytics with TabNet is practical, secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient for regulated enterprise and government uses.

Abstract: Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven
analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where
timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed
frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or
streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing
overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference.
Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet
enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for
regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big
Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless
GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput,
serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for
IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets,
comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that
GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90%
lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance
mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains
stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these
findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged
blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of
secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for
regulated enterprise and government settings.

### [189] [CommonSense: Efficient Set Intersection (SetX) Protocol Based on Compressed Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19725)
*Jingfan Meng,Tianji Yang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new multi-round protocol for solving the set intersection (SetX) problem, achieving a significant communication cost improvement over previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solutions for the SetX problem reuse SetR protocols, mistakenly assuming similar computational and communication costs between these problems.

Method: The proposed SetX protocol uses compressed sensing (CS) sketches for iterative communication between parties, enabling efficient identification of set intersection.

Result: Experiments show the protocol achieves 8-10x reduction in communication cost compared to IBLT-based SetR protocols.

Conclusion: The study introduces an efficient, specialized approach to the SetX problem, demonstrating its cost-effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In the set reconciliation (\textsf{SetR}) problem, two parties Alice and Bob,
holding sets $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$, communicate to learn the symmetric
difference $\mathsf{A} \Delta \mathsf{B}$. In this work, we study a related but
under-explored problem: set intersection (\textsf{SetX})~\cite{Ozisik2019},
where both parties learn $\mathsf{A} \cap \mathsf{B}$ instead. However,
existing solutions typically reuse \textsf{SetR} protocols due to the absence
of dedicated \textsf{SetX} protocols and the misconception that \textsf{SetR}
and \textsf{SetX} have comparable costs. Observing that \textsf{SetX} is
fundamentally cheaper than \textsf{SetR}, we developed a multi-round
\textsf{SetX} protocol that outperforms the information-theoretic lower bound
of \textsf{SetR} problem. In our \textsf{SetX} protocol, Alice sends Bob a
compressed sensing (CS) sketch of $\mathsf{A}$ to help Bob identify his unique
elements (those in $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$). This solves the \textsf{SetX}
problem, if $\mathsf{A} \subseteq \mathsf{B}$. Otherwise, Bob sends a CS sketch
of the residue (a set of elements he cannot decode) back to Alice for her to
decode her unique elements (those in $\mathsf{A \setminus B}$). As such, Alice
and Bob communicate back and forth %with a set membership filter (SMF) of
estimated $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$. Alice updates $\mathsf{A}$ and
communication repeats until both parties agrees on $\mathsf{A} \cap
\mathsf{B}$. On real world datasets, experiments show that our $\mathsf{SetX}$
protocol reduces the communication cost by 8 to 10 times compared to the
IBLT-based $\mathsf{SetR}$ protocol.

Motivation: In-memory key-value datastores are vital for modern infrastructures, but face challenges in scalability, compatibility, and sustainability. There is a lack of experimental comparisons in existing literature.

Method: Authors benchmark Redis replacements under Kubernetes workloads, focusing on metrics such as latency, resource efficiency, and migration challenges.

Result: The study highlights trade-offs in performance, compatibility, and long-term feasibility of in-memory key-value stores.

*Laurent Bonnasse-Gahot,Jean-Pierre Nadal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how category learning in artificial networks leads to neural activity changes near category boundaries, using theoretical frameworks and empirical examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how category learning affects neural representations, linking findings from neuroscience to artificial networks and analyzing their efficiency.

Method: The authors extend a theoretical framework to artificial networks by linking Bayes cost minimization to maximizing mutual information and explore the role of Fisher information for structured data featuring category-specific metric changes.

Result: The study demonstrates alignment between neural representations and category boundaries, showing the expansion of neural space near decision boundaries using toy models and the MNIST dataset.

Conclusion: Optimal learning in artificial networks creates neural representations that adapt to category boundaries, supported by a theoretical link to Information Bottleneck principles and bias-variance decomposition.

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

*Minseok Jung,Abhas Ricky,Muhammad Rameez Chatni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D optimization framework to improve AI inference scaling by jointly considering accuracy, cost, and latency rather than traditional 1D or 2D heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing 1D and 2D optimization heuristics that fail to incorporate constraints like cost and latency in AI inference scaling.

Method: A 3D optimization framework using Monte Carlo simulations is employed across scenarios and simulated large language models, evaluating four optimization methods for multi-objective optimization.

Result: The proposed framework identifies feasible spaces missed by traditional methods; knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization suits precision-focused tasks.

Conclusion: The 3D optimization framework offers a robust way to optimize inference scaling, considering deployment-aware constraints like accuracy, cost, and latency across diverse contexts.

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable model architecture leveraging multitask learning for functional neuroimaging, optimized for clinical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in AI-based neuroimage applications stemming from limited sample sizes and suboptimal models for predicting disease outcomes.

Method: Developed a multitask learning approach for brain modeling with (i) pretrained Brain-Environment Interaction (BEI) tokenization and (ii) semi-supervised fine-tuning using pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieved successful evaluations in tasks like sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and early diagnosis of multiple diseases, including Autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Schizophrenia.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model shows substantial potential in advancing functional neuroimaging applications and clinical usage.

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

*Yang Zhang,Rui Zhang,Jiaming Guo,Lei Huang,Di Huang,Yunpu Zhao,Shuyao Cheng,Pengwei Jin,Chongxiao Li,Zidong Du,Xing Hu,Qi Guo,Yunji Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QiMeng-SALV, a method for optimizing Verilog code generation using signal-aware learning during reinforcement training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to Verilog code generation lack meaningful functional rewards, which hinders reinforcement learning optimization for creating functionally correct code.

Method: QiMeng-SALV extracts verified signal-aware implementations from partially incorrect modules and uses them to enhance functional rewards. It employs ASTs for verifying and segmenting code at the signal-level, ensuring noise reduction and better RL training.

Result: QiMeng-SALV achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks VerilogEval and RTLLM, enabling a 7B model to rival the performance of the massive DeepSeek v3 671B model and outperform other leading open-source models.

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV shifts the optimization paradigm from module-level to signal-level, improving functionality in Verilog code generation and demonstrating its utility in automated circuit design.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

### [195] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO is a framework that extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by incorporating soft preferences, reference-policy anchoring, and listwise extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO has limitations with binary labels and pairwise comparisons, prompting the need for a more robust and generalized framework to manage uncertainty, stabilize training, and address noise.

Method: ADPO introduces soft preference probabilities, reference-policy anchoring, and listwise preference modeling techniques to overcome limitations of traditional DPO. Several variants such as pairwise anchored Soft-DPO and KDE-based listwise ADPO are proposed based on application scenarios.

Result: Anchoring improved metrics significantly in contextual bandits and reinforcement learning tasks, achieving up to 112% relative gains in heavy-tailed noise scenarios and enhanced performance in noisy environments.

Conclusion: ADPO provides flexibility and reliability across different contexts and noise levels, offering practical guidance for real-world application concerning preference optimization.

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the increasing need for frameworks capable of leveraging on-device hardware, facilitating machine learning directly on smaller devices like laptops and mobile phones, especially within the Apple ecosystem.

Method: The study developed MLX-Transformers to implement transformer architecture with MLX and compared its inference latency performance against Pytorch on Apple Silicon and NVIDIA CUDA GPU by benchmarking models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa.

Result: The results show that MLX effectively leverages Apple silicon's architecture, performing efficient inference of transformer models while eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion when porting from other frameworks.

Conclusion: MLX demonstrates significant potential for enabling efficient, accessible ML computations directly on Apple devices, paving the way for further research and implementation of diverse ML models.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRPO and Dr.GRPO frameworks to address the sensitivity of RLHF to reward noise, providing a noise correction strategy and achieving consistent performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenges posed by noisy, inconsistent, or erroneous rewards in RLHF for better alignment and reasoning in models.

Method: It develops GRPO and Dr.GRPO frameworks that model reward corruption as Bernoulli noise and correct this noise using reward flip probabilities to ensure unbiased gradient estimates.

Result: The proposed noise correction leads to significant improvements in math accuracy (up to 6.7%) and code tasks (up to 1.5%) under realistic reward model conditions.

Conclusion: The work offers a hybrid approach bridging label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, resulting in theoretical robustness and practical viability in noisy reward scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes three innovative methods to accurately model and predict complex multiscale system dynamics, addressing nonlinearities and capturing high-frequency behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant challenge in modeling complex multiscale systems due to their inherent nonlinearities, sensitivity to initial conditions, and limitations of traditional machine learning methods.

Method: The paper presents three approaches: (1) using the Partition of Unity (PU) method integrated with neural networks, (2) applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes for separating dynamics, and (3) utilizing Sparse High-Order SVD for reconstructing dynamics from limited data.

Result: The proposed methods effectively capture coarse and fine dynamics, enabling accurate modeling of real-world multiscale phenomena even in cases with incomplete data.

Conclusion: These approaches provide a robust framework for interpreting and approximating complex systems across all relevant time scales, making them highly suitable for real-world and high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) optimization and introduces BAPO, a method to stabilize and improve RL training by adjusting clipping bounds, achieving notable performance improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the application of RL to large language models (LLMs), particularly in off-policy settings where training efficiency is sought, but current methods face instability and reduced policy entropy.

Method: The proposed method is BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), which dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to balance positive and negative policy updates, stabilize optimization, and preserve entropy.

Result: BAPO demonstrates clear advantages in off-policy RL scenarios, providing fast, stable, and efficient training. It outperforms open-source and proprietary models on AIME 2024 and 2025 benchmarks for both 7B and 32B model scales.

Conclusion: The method improves RL optimization in LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance through better balancing of policy updates and preserving exploration during training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [200] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Many post-mortem generalization measures for DNNs are sensitive to small changes in training setups and fail to capture consistent qualitative trends, highlighting their fragility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the reliability of post-mortem generalization measures and their ability to reproduce qualitative trends in DNNs amidst minor training modifications.

Method: The paper examines the fragility in various generalization measures by analyzing how small modifications to training settings (e.g., hyperparameters) impact trends, values, or scaling behavior.

Result: Several widely-used measures, including norms and PAC-Bayes bounds, exhibit significant fragility in their ability to capture generalization trends under minor training changes.

Conclusion: Future development of generalization measures must include explicit audits for fragility to enhance their reliability in analyzing trained DNNs.

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

TL;DR: NeuroAda is a new method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal trainable parameters and reduced memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods face a trade-off between representational capacity and memory efficiency, limiting their suitability for fine-grained adaptation.

Method: NeuroAda identifies key parameters in the network, introduces bypass connections, and updates only those bypass connections during finetuning.

Result: NeuroAda demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across over 23 tasks, using less than 0.02% trainable parameters and reducing memory usage by up to 60%.

Conclusion: NeuroAda effectively balances fine-grained adaptation and memory efficiency, presenting an innovative solution to challenges in PEFT methods.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

### [202] [Actor-Free Continuous Control via Structurally Maximizable Q-Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18828)
*Yigit Korkmaz,Urvi Bhuwania,Ayush Jain,Erdem Bıyık*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel value-based framework for continuous control tasks, bypassing traditional actor-critic methods, and achieves competitive performance without an actor's cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a more efficient and stable way for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces, addressing shortcomings in traditional actor-critic methods.

Method: A purely value-based framework is introduced, leveraging structural maximization of Q-functions and specific architectural and algorithmic innovations.

Result: The proposed approach performs on par with state-of-the-art methods in simulation tasks, especially excelling in environments with constrained action spaces.

Conclusion: The value-based approach offers a viable alternative for continuous control, improving stability and efficiency while overcoming non-smooth value function challenges.

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

### [203] [Towards Universal Solvers: Using PGD Attack in Active Learning to Increase Generalizability of Neural Operators as Knowledge Distillation from Numerical PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18989)
*Yifei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an adversarial teacher-student distillation framework to enhance neural operators for nonlinear PDEs, addressing out-of-distribution generalization issues while maintaining speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of neural operators, such as poor out-of-distribution generalization in solving nonlinear PDEs, while aiming for faster inference compared to traditional solvers.

Method: The method involves an adversarial teacher-student setup where a differentiable numerical solver teaches a neural operator. A PGD-style active sampling loop identifies challenging inputs to expand the training set.

Result: Experimental results on Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems show that the proposed method improves out-of-distribution robustness while retaining the efficiency of neural operators.

Conclusion: Adversarial distillation significantly enhances the performance of neural operators on nonlinear PDEs, balancing robustness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

### [204] [An Encode-then-Decompose Approach to Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection on Contaminated Training Data--Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18998)
*Buang Zhang,Tung Kieu,Xiangfei Qiu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Aoying Zhou,Christian S. Jensen,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new paradigm for unsupervised time series anomaly detection using autoencoders, focusing on robustness to contaminated training data and improved anomaly detection metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoencoder models for unsupervised time series anomaly detection struggle with reduced accuracy due to sensitivity to training data anomalies.

Method: The authors propose an encode-then-decompose framework to split encoded representations into stable and auxiliary representations, improving robustness against contaminated data. Additionally, they introduce a novel mutual information-based metric for anomaly detection.

Result: The approach achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on eight standard benchmarks, demonstrating robustness across varying contamination levels in time series data.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm significantly enhances the reliability and effectiveness of time series anomaly detection while addressing shortcomings of traditional autoencoder methods.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

*Saman Nessari,Ali Bozorgi-Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system that combines Large Language Models, generative networks, counterfactual models, and contextual bandits to improve personalized medical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical practices often overlook individual patient differences, leading to inadequate health outcomes.

Method: The system integrates LLMs for structured data extraction, CTGANs for synthetic patient data generation, T-learners for personalized treatment predictions, and contextual bandits for optimizing clinical decisions.

Result: The approach demonstrated high performance in data processing (93.2%), patient data generation (55%), treatment forecasting (84.3%), and reward optimization (0.60-0.61) in testing scenarios.

Conclusion: This solution enhances online therapeutic decisions, tackles limitations in cold-start situations, and progresses toward individualized medicine.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

### [206] [Empowering Decision Trees via Shape Function Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19040)
*Nakul Upadhya,Eldan Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Shape Generalized Tree (SGT), enhancing decision trees by allowing non-linear, interpretable splits using learnable functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision trees struggle with capturing non-linear effects due to their reliance on axis-aligned linear splits, leading to complex structures that reduce interpretability.

Method: The authors propose SGTs utilizing learnable axis-aligned shape functions for non-linear splits and introduce efficient algorithms like ShapeCART and its extensions for bivariate and multi-way trees.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SGTs outperform traditional decision trees by achieving better accuracy with smaller model sizes.

Conclusion: Shape Generalized Trees provide an interpretable and effective solution to address limitations of traditional decision trees in capturing non-linear relationships.

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

### [207] [POLAR: Policy-based Layerwise Reinforcement Learning Method for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19056)
*Kuai Yu,Xiaoyu Wu,Peishen Yan,Qingqian Yang,Linshan Jiang,Hao Wang,Yang Hua,Tao Song,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces POLAR, a novel reinforcement learning-based pipeline for selecting backdoor-critical layers in Federated Learning, outperforming existing methods by up to 40% against advanced defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) models to stealthy and effective backdoor attacks targeting specific layers, while improving attack effectiveness and bypassing current defenses.

Method: The authors present POLAR, a policy-based reinforcement learning approach that uses Bernoulli sampling for lightweight layer selection. It employs policy gradient updates based on the backdoor success rate and incorporates a regularization constraint to maintain stealthiness.

Result: Extensive experiments show POLAR's superior performance, achieving up to 40% enhancement over previous methods against six state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: POLAR proves itself as a robust and stealthy method for layer-wise backdoor attacks in FL, effectively balancing attack success and reduced detection risk.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

*Evgenia Shustova,Marina Sheshukova,Sergey Samsonov,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Scalable LinUCB, a more efficient linear contextual bandit algorithm that lowers computational and memory costs through a low-rank matrix approximation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in linear contextual bandits, such as the computational, inference, and memory limitations of the commonly used LinUCB algorithm.

Method: The paper presents a dynamical low-rank parametrization of the inverse design matrix using Cholesky-style factors for efficient updates without forming the entire matrix directly. It combines rank-1 and batched updates with a projector-splitting integrator to control memory growth.

Result: The algorithm achieves an average per-step update cost and memory complexity of $O(dr)$, with inference complexity of $O(dr)$ for action evaluations. Experimental validation on recommender system datasets confirms the algorithm's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB significantly improves the efficiency of linear contextual bandit algorithms, making it practical for large-scale feature dimensions and action spaces in recommender systems.

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

### [209] [Weight Decay may matter more than muP for Learning Rate Transfer in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19093)
*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates the Maximal Update Parameterization (muP) for efficient learning rate transfer in neural networks and finds that weight decay is more crucial than muP scaling for long-term training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning at large scales is expensive. Transferring learning rates between small and large networks is desirable for efficient training, motivating the analysis of muP-scaling's reliability in practical setups.

Method: The paper conducts large-scale empirical investigations to test assumptions underlying muP's scaling rules, focusing on its performance during learning rate transfer in setups like large language model (LLM) training.

Result: The assumptions underlying muP scaling hold briefly only early in training. Throughout the rest of training, weight decay—not muP scaling—correctly stabilizes update dynamics, allowing effective learning rate transfer.

Conclusion: muP scaling serves mainly as an implicit learning rate warmup mechanism and can largely be replaced by adjusted warmup schedules. This challenges established perspectives on learning rate transfer and explains the necessity of independent weight decay for muP success.

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

### [210] [What Makes a Good Curriculum? Disentangling the Effects of Data Ordering on LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19099)
*Yaning Jia,Chunhui Zhang,Xingjian Diao,Xiangchi Yuan,Zhongyu Ouyang,soroush vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum learning, a method of ordering data from easy to hard, does not have a universally superior strategy for improving reasoning in language models. The effectiveness varies by metric, model capability, and task complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand when and how curriculum learning strategies enhance large language models' reasoning skills, given the open questions about the effectiveness of different approaches.

Method: Developed an offline evaluation framework for analyzing curriculum learning across five dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Conducted controlled experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks using Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B.

Result: The effectiveness of curriculum learning strategies is dependent on model capability, task complexity, and metrics used. Forward or reverse curriculum learning yields varied outcomes. Task-aligned curricula focus on representation and generalization, while inner-state curricula affect factors like confidence and uncertainty.

Conclusion: There is no universal curriculum strategy for optimizing learning. Guidance for choosing curricula should depend on the model and task, with attention to metrics and the interaction between uncertainty and learning gains.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

### [211] [Policy Learning with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19672)
*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a policy learning framework that incorporates abstention, addressing risks in uncertain predictions for high-stakes scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current policy learning methods enforce decisions even under uncertainty, posing significant risks in critical applications like personalized medicine.

Method: The authors present a two-stage learner that first identifies near-optimal policies and then defines abstention rules based on disagreements. They provide O(1/n)-type regret guarantees and extend them for unknown propensities using a doubly robust objective.

Result: The framework demonstrates enhanced guarantees under margin conditions, connects to distributionally robust policy learning, and ensures safe policy improvement over a baseline policy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach introduces abstention as a practical and versatile mechanism, improving safety and robustness in policy learning.

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaCluster, a framework for compressing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) without sacrificing accuracy, achieving up to 80x reduction in parameter storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs enhance expressivity and accuracy but lead to a significant increase in parameters and memory requirements, necessitating efficient compression methods.

Method: MetaCluster utilizes a lightweight meta-learner to map low-dimensional embeddings to coefficient vectors, shapes them for clustering, employs K-means in coefficient space, and fine-tunes a centroid codebook to compress KAN parameters.

Result: MetaCluster enables up to 80x reduction in parameter storage for KANs on datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaCluster effectively compresses KANs by exploiting vector-based coefficients, offering high storage efficiency without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

*Bhavya Agrawalla,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Promit Ghosal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper establishes a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in a high-dimensional, growing regime, introducing a computationally efficient approach with a reduced iteration requirement. The study also provides an online variance estimator for confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many high-stakes applications utilizing Stochastic Gradient Descent demand precise uncertainty quantification, but current high-dimensional methods are computationally intensive and restrictive in their requirements.

Method: The authors establish non-asymptotic Berry–Esseen bounds for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD, allowing a CLT in growing-dimensional regimes. They propose an SGD-based approach with improved runtime and memory efficiency, alongside an online variance estimator with high-probability deviation bounds.

Result: The study demonstrates that the proposed method achieves a Gaussian CLT with iterations scaling as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ (where $\delta > 0$), significantly relaxing dimensional restrictions and improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a scalable and efficient solution for uncertainty quantification in SGD, enabling fully online, data-driven confidence interval construction in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

### [214] [Learning Peer Influence Probabilities with Linear Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19119)
*Ahmed Sayeed Faruk,Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for estimating peer influence probabilities in networked environments, focusing on balancing regret minimization and estimation accuracy using a contextual linear bandit-based algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding peer influence probabilities is critical for information diffusion and effective viral marketing strategies, but estimating these probabilities often faces challenges in distinguishing correlation from true influence.

Method: The authors use a contextual linear bandit framework and propose an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm to balance the trade-off between minimizing regret and reducing estimation error.

Result: Their experiments on semi-synthetic datasets indicate that their proposed method outperforms static models and other contextual bandit approaches, successfully navigating the trade-off.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a tunable algorithm can effectively learn peer influence probabilities while balancing exploration and estimation accuracy, offering significant improvement in modeling peer effects.

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

*Daniel Zhao,Daniel Beaglehole,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Julian McAuley,Zachary Novack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM introduces a framework for controllable music generation using Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs), enabling precise real-time steering of pre-trained music models without audible artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in controllable music generation, improve interpretability, and minimize artifacts in existing methods that require retraining or optimization.

Method: The framework employs RFMs to analyze internal gradients of frozen, pre-trained music models, identifies musical concept directions using RFM probes, and injects these into models during inference with innovative control mechanisms.

Result: The approach achieves significant improvement in generating target musical notes accuracy (0.23 to 0.82) while maintaining prompt fidelity within ~0.02 deviation.

Conclusion: MusicRFM provides an effective way to balance control and generation quality, offering more precise music generation with minimal fidelity loss, and fosters further exploration with open code release.

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to

### [216] [InvarGC: Invariant Granger Causality for Heterogeneous Interventional Time Series under Latent Confounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19138)
*Ziyi Zhang,Shaogang Ren,Xiaoning Qian,Nick Duffield*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Granger causality tests often fail to detect non-linear relationships due to latent confounders and unknown interventions. This paper proposes Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC) to address these issues, achieving improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Granger causality, traditionally applied through linear models for causal structure discovery, struggles with nonlinear relationships and assumptions on causal sufficiency. Real-world datasets have latent confounding and unknown interventions, posing challenges in identifying causal relations.

Method: The authors propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which uses cross-environment heterogeneity to manage latent confounding and distinguish between intervened and non-intervened environments. It identifies edge-level granularity and ensures invariant causal relations.

Result: InvarGC is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing competitive performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach addresses challenges in causal structure discovery caused by latent confounding and unknown interventions, ensuring robust identification with improved accuracy in various environments.

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [217] [Subliminal Corruption: Mechanisms, Thresholds, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19152)
*Reya Vir,Sarvesh Bhatnagar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores subliminal corruption in AI, where undesirable traits spread via semantically neutral data. The study identifies sharp alignment failure thresholds and challenges in detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the problem of subtle misalignments in AI models caused by synthetic data and quantify their dynamics, which previously lacked comprehensive understanding.

Method: A systematic study using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2 was conducted to analyze subliminal corruption. The research explores scaling laws, thresholds, and mechanisms.

Result: Three findings are presented: (1) subliminal corruption degrades model alignment through behavioral crossover; (2) alignment failures are sudden and phase-like; (3) the corruption mechanism resembles natural fine-tuning, making detection difficult.

Conclusion: AI systems relying on synthetic data are vulnerable to subliminal corruption. New safety protocols are required to manage latent threats effectively.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

### [218] [Feature Space Adaptation for Robust Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19155)
*Peng Wang,Minghao Gu,Qiang Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses catastrophic forgetting during model fine-tuning by introducing two methods, LoRFA and VeFA, which fine-tune pre-trained models in feature space instead of weight space to enhance robustness and preserve pre-trained knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges of catastrophic forgetting during model fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data or significant distribution shifts from the pre-training domain.

Method: The paper introduces LoRFA (Low-Rank Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation), which adapt models in feature space by accounting for the effects of downstream lurking variables using feature-level transformations.

Result: The proposed feature adaptation methods, LoRFA and VeFA, achieve robust fine-tuning performance compared to weight-based methods like LoRA while consistently improving robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning in the feature space better preserves pre-trained knowledge, showing comparable standard performance but enhanced robustness against distribution shifts compared to weight-space methods.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

### [219] [Instance-Dependent Regret Bounds for Nonstochastic Linear Partial Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19158)
*Federico Di Gennaro,Khaled Eldowa,Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores linear partial monitoring with infinite outcomes and a linear structure, addressing a finite-actions adversarial version while improving transparency and efficiency in regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand linear partial monitoring, generalize linear bandits, and provide more interpretable regret bounds for nonstochastic settings.

Method: The authors used an exploration-by-optimization approach with efficient implementation to address finite-action adversarial problems and derive regret bounds based on game structures.

Result: The paper establishes regret bounds with instance-specific alignment measures, achieving standard rates of $\sqrt{T}$ for easy games and $T^{2/3}$ for challenging ones.

Conclusion: This study enhances the theoretical foundation of linear partial monitoring and provides practical insights into regret bounds for different game structures.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

*Paimon Goulart,Jordan Steinhauser,Kylene Shuler,Edward Korzus,Jia Chen,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a vision-language model to analyze mouse behaviors efficiently via videos and text input, producing high-accuracy behavioral vectors over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interdisciplinary explorations and enable detailed studies of mouse behaviors by integrating diverse data types.

Method: They enhanced the Qwen2.5-VL model using prompts, in-context learning with labeled examples, and preprocessing, achieving effective behavior classification without model fine-tuning.

Result: The approach yielded high F1 scores for mouse behaviors, including rare ones like freezing and fleeing, with minimal user input.

Conclusion: The model provides a robust tool for researchers to generate comprehensive datasets addressing complex questions across various time points and environments.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the theoretical aspects of Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) for non-conjugate likelihoods, enhancing understanding of its geometry and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of theoretical understanding of NGVI, especially in non-conjugate likelihood scenarios where variational loss is non-convex.

Method: The authors derive conditions for relative smoothness of the variational loss, propose a modified NGVI algorithm with non-Euclidean projections, and explore hidden convexity properties under structural assumptions.

Result: The paper demonstrates global convergence of the modified algorithm to a stationary point and, under certain assumptions, fast global convergence to a global optimum.

Conclusion: The work enhances the theoretical framework of NGVI, offering insights into its application in complex inference scenarios and supporting its robustness in non-conjugate cases.

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

*Runzhe Wu,Ankur Samanta,Ayush Jain,Scott Fujimoto,Jeongyeol Kwon,Ben Kretzu,Youliang Yu,Kaveh Hassani,Boris Vidolov,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper finds that multi-task RL post-training for LLMs suffers from gradient imbalances across tasks, which biases optimization toward tasks with larger gradients but does not necessarily lead to better performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and address limitations in multi-task post-training of large language models, particularly focusing on how unbalanced task gradients affect optimization and learning outcomes.

Method: Analyzed gradient magnitudes generated during multi-task RL post-training and examined their relationship to learning gains and performance improvements across tasks.

Result: Discovered that certain tasks generate disproportionately larger gradients, biasing optimization toward those tasks without translating to proportional learning benefits.

Conclusion: Warns against naive dataset mixing in multi-task LLM post-training and suggests the need for gradient-level corrections to address inherent task differences.

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

### [223] [A Communication-Efficient Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19199)
*Xiaoxing Ren,Nicola Bastianello,Thomas Parisini,Andreas A. Malikopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a decentralized actor-critic framework for reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems with limited communication. This method reduces communication needs while preserving coordination, supported by theoretical convergence results and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems while mitigating limited communication among agents.

Method: A decentralized actor-critic framework where agents perform local updates to policies and value functions using neural networks before exchanging information with neighbors.

Result: Finite-time convergence analysis is provided, with sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and communication complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$. Experiments validate these findings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces communication burden and provides theoretical guarantees, making it suitable for cooperative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

### [224] [An Active Diffusion Neural Network for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19202)
*Mengying Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADGNN, an Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network, to address the over-smoothing problem by incorporating external information sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most graph neural networks emulate passive heat diffusion, leading to over-smoothing and challenges in representing global graph properties.

Method: ADGNN integrates external information sources to create active diffusion and calculates the infinite diffusion using a closed-form solution.

Result: ADGNN's approach enhances accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models in graph tasks, preserving node uniqueness and capturing global graph properties.

Conclusion: ADGNN effectively overcomes over-smoothing, improves computational efficiency, and preserves graph information while accessing global structure.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new collaborative learning approach for GNNs that doesn't require a teacher model, showing promising results across multiple classification tasks using student ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome limitations of traditional KD in GNNs by eliminating dependence on pre-trained teacher models and enhancing collaboration among student networks.

Method: It proposes a collaborative learning framework where student GNNs mutually teach each other using adaptive logit weighting and entropy enhancement techniques during training.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach, showing better inference performance and task adaptability of student GNNs.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning among student GNNs proves to be an effective strategy, opening up possibilities for simplified architectures to achieve high performance in diverse tasks without relying on teacher models.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ConvXformer, a hybrid approach combining ConvNeXt blocks and Transformer encoders for inertial navigation with improved privacy-preserving mechanisms. It achieves a balance between performance and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities in inertial navigation systems caused by privacy breaches without compromising model performance.

Method: Proposed ConvXformer architecture with differential privacy mechanisms like adaptive gradient clipping and gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI). Used truncated singular value decomposition for precise privacy-utility trade-off.

Result: ConvXformer achieved over 40% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to prior methods, with $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. Performance validated using benchmark datasets and a real-world dataset (Mech-IO).

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances navigation accuracy and privacy, offering robust performance even in challenging environments with sensor distortions.

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

*Youngsik Hwang,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on Machine Unlearning (MU) by reframing it as a multi-objective optimization problem and proposing a new algorithm, CUP, for better control of unlearning intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in traditional MU methods, such as the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model fidelity, risk of over-forgetting, and lack of efficient evaluation metrics.

Method: The proposed method introduces Controllable Unlearning by Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which uses a novel pivoting mechanism and an 'unlearning intensity' hyperparameter to navigate the Pareto frontier effectively.

Result: Experiments show that CUP outperforms existing methods in generating superior Pareto-optimal solutions across different vision tasks using hypervolume indicators for evaluation.

Conclusion: CUP provides a controllable and effective solution to the challenges in MU, offering superior balance between unlearning efficacy and model retention while ensuring precise control over trade-offs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Motivation: To address challenges in unsupervised learning, inspired by how infants perform hierarchical categorization, novelty detection, and context adaptation.

Method: A finite-resolution clustering framework with attraction-repulsion dynamics and a single resolution parameter, evaluated by a new tool called mheatmap.

Result: Configurations show strong performance: competitive clustering metrics, 87% AUC in novelty detection, and 35% better stability in dynamic category evolution.

Conclusion: Configurations provide a principled model for early cognitive categorization and present a step toward brain-inspired AI solutions.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how design choices influence time series foundation models (TSFMs) behavior rather than claiming superiority over others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the subtle inductive biases introduced by various design choices in TSFMs and their implications.

Method: A mix of theoretical analysis and controlled empirical evaluations to identify the effects of design knobs such as patch size, embedding choice, and training objectives.

Result: It was revealed that these design choices cause implicit biases affecting temporal behavior, geometric structure, and mean regression—and these biases vary across properties of the model and data.

Conclusion: Design decisions in TSFMs induce complex biases that can be intuitive or counterintuitive, emphasizing nuanced understanding for effective model building.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOT introduces a scalable method for computing interpretable decision tree policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) using MILP optimization and efficient parallel tree-structure searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of optimizing decision tree policies in MDPs, critical for high-stakes decision-making, while ensuring they remain interpretable.

Method: SPOT employs a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulation and a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that separates MDP dynamics from tree constraints, enabling efficient parallel processing.

Result: SPOT achieves significant speedup, scalability to larger MDPs, and produces compact, interpretable decision trees without performance compromise, outperforming existing approaches by an order of magnitude in runtime.

Conclusion: SPOT offers a novel and efficient solution for generating interpretable and scalable decision tree policies in MDPs, merging transparency and performance optimization effectively.

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of pixel prediction-based world models in robotic planning, which often fail to align with the objectives of decision-making tasks.

Method: The method proposes world modeling as a visual question answering task to predict task-relevant semantic information using pre-trained vision-language models, finetuned on image-action-text data.

Result: The semantic world model showed enhanced generalization and robustness, enabling improved decision-making and policy optimization for open-ended robotic tasks compared to reconstruction-based approaches.

Conclusion: Semantic prediction-based world models leveraging pretrained vision-language frameworks significantly outperform traditional pixel reconstruction-based models in robotic planning tasks.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

### [232] [Interpret Policies in Deep Reinforcement Learning using SILVER with RL-Guided Labeling: A Model-level Approach to High-dimensional and Multi-action Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19244)
*Yiyu Qian,Su Nguyen,Chao Chen,Qinyue Zhou,Liyuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an enhanced version of the SILVER framework for explainable reinforcement learning, expanding its capabilities to multi-action and high-dimensional settings while maintaining agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing SILVER framework lacks scalability and is limited to low-dimensional, binary-action environments, which restricts its applicability for explaining reinforcement learning policies.

Method: The authors enhance the SILVER framework by introducing RL-guided labeling, feature extraction, SHAP-based feature attribution, and training surrogate models to generate interpretable insights for deep RL policies in complex environments.

Result: The enhanced SILVER framework improves the transparency and human understanding of RL agent behavior without compromising task performance, as demonstrated in two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed SILVER extension successfully makes reinforcement learning policies interpretable in high-dimensional, multi-action domains, advancing the field of explainable RL.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

*Juntang Wang,Hao Wu,Runkun Guo,Yihan Wang,Dongmian Zou,Shixin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraMixC, a module leveraging emergent hierarchical cluster configurations to improve predictions, validated on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance clustering and prediction capabilities using configurations derived from Vision Transformers without reliance on labeled data.

Method: GraMixC is proposed, employing Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) techniques to align and fuse hierarchical cluster configurations for better prediction outputs.

Result: GraMixC improves R2 score in cultivation media prediction task from 0.6 to 0.9, surpasses baselines on tabular benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraMixC demonstrates the efficacy of leveraging hierarchical configurations for enhanced performance in both task-specific and general prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FnRGNN is a fairness-aware framework for GNN-based node regression, ensuring fairness via a multi-level strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in graph neural networks, particularly for regression tasks, is underexplored; existing methods don't fully address continuous node regression challenges.

Method: FnRGNN intervenes at three levels: edge reweighting for structure-level, alignment via MMD for representation-level, and normalization via Sinkhorn-based distribution matching for prediction-level.

Result: Experiments on four datasets show that FnRGNN reduces group disparities without compromising performance.

Conclusion: FnRGNN achieves fairness in GNN-based node regression through its multi-level adjustments and effectively balances fairness and task performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

### [235] [Data Efficient Any Transformer-to-Mamba Distillation via Attention Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19266)
*Penghao Wang,Yuhao Zhou,Mengxuan Wu,Panpan Zhang,Zhangyang Wang,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method called Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), which helps transfer knowledge from Transformer models to state-space models (SSMs) more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have superior scalability and have dominated sequence modeling, whereas state-space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives but their ecosystem and training remain immature. Efficiently transferring knowledge from Transformers to SSMs is challenging.

Method: The paper proposes CAB, a distillation framework using token-level supervision, a lightweight attention bridge, and flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural differences and enhance transferability.

Result: Experiments across vision and language tasks prove CAB improves state-space models' performance under limited data conditions, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

Conclusion: CAB demonstrates that attention-based knowledge from Transformers can be reliably distilled into state-space models, unlocking opportunities to enhance their performance and promote their ecosystem.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

### [236] [Knowledge Distillation of Uncertainty using Deep Latent Factor Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19290)
*Sehyun Park,Jongjin Lee,Yunseop Shin,Ilsang Ohn,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Gaussian distillation, a method for compressing a deep ensemble of models while maintaining their uncertainty quantification capabilities. It shows better performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmarks and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensembles provide reliable uncertainty quantification but are computationally and memory-intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-limited settings like on-device AI. Current knowledge distillation methods do not preserve uncertainty effectively, particularly due to size reduction in neural networks.

Method: The paper introduces Gaussian distillation, which compresses an ensemble into a student distribution using a deep latent factor model (DLF) based on Gaussian processes. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF are estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Gaussian distillation outperforms existing methods. It is also effective for fine-tuning language models and handling distribution shift problems.

Conclusion: Gaussian distillation successfully addresses the challenge of compressing ensembles while retaining uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for practical applications in AI tasks.

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

*Mingyu Jo,Jaesik Yoon,Justin Deschenaux,Caglar Gulcehre,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Loopholing Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) to address the issues in discrete diffusion models by preserving distributional information via a latent pathway and achieves improved generative performance and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models face limitations in generative tasks due to information loss during categorical sampling steps, which necessitates a mechanism to preserve rich information across steps.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a deterministic latent pathway termed 'Loopholing', combined with a self-conditioning training strategy to enable more coherent and scalable text generation.

Result: LDDMs demonstrate substantial improvements, reducing generative perplexity by up to 61% compared to prior models, and outperforming autoregressive approaches in certain cases with coherent text generation and enhanced reasoning task performance.

Conclusion: Loopholing mitigates inefficient sampling steps, effectively addressing challenges of discrete diffusion models, and offers a scalable solution for high-quality non-autoregressive text generation and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

TL;DR: This paper presents improved Species Distribution Modelling for frogs using deep learning, data imputation, and multimodal approaches, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional species distribution monitoring methods like citizen science, and to improve predictive modeling using advanced computational approaches for better conservation strategies.

Method: The study employs deep learning and data imputation techniques, multimodal ensemble modeling integrating land cover and NDVI, and data preprocessing like balancing and feature selection to enhance SDM accuracy.

Result: The approach reduced MAE from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks, optimized key environmental inputs while maintaining predictive accuracy, and achieved 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90 in habitat classification.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques can effectively enhance ecological predictive modeling, contributing to scalable and precise biodiversity monitoring in the context of sparse data.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel calibration pipeline for machine learning models, leveraging clusters of learned representations to improve prediction reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for highly reliable predictions in machine learning, focusing on calibration for critical decisions like clinical predictions.

Method: The proposed pipeline utilizes an ensemble of calibration functions trained on clustered learned representations, optimizing calibration and introducing a matching metric.

Result: The approach enhances calibration scores, improving them from 82.28% to 100%, and combines discrimination with calibration optimization.

Conclusion: It provides a flexible, superior calibration scheme adaptable to various methods, ensuring enhanced decision-making reliability.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces two advanced models (Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0) with hybrid architectures combining linear and softmax attention for efficient long-context inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational and I/O overhead in long-context inference while maintaining high performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining linear attention and softmax attention, and leveraging a high-performance FP8 operator library for efficient training.

Result: Inference costs reduced by up to 90% compared to dense models, and training efficiency is improved by 50%, achieving SOTA performance in reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed models optimize resource utilization and deliver stable, efficient, and superior performance in long-context and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

*Alvaro Perez-Diaz,James C. Loach,Danielle E. Toutoungi,Lee Middleton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the gap between forecast accuracy and practical utility in time-series foundation models by focusing on forecast types and their operational compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the practical challenges posed by forecast types in time-series models, emphasizing the necessity for trajectory ensembles in many real-world applications.

Method: The analysis examines recent models, discusses conversion methods between forecast types, proves the importance of temporal dependence, and proposes a task-aligned evaluation framework.

Result: It finds two-thirds of models produce point or parametric forecasts and demonstrates the limitations of conversions between forecast types in preserving temporal dependence.

Conclusion: Forecast type plays a critical role in determining the practical utility of time-series models beyond accuracy, especially for applications requiring trajectory ensembles.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

### [242] [A New Type of Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19347)
*Xingyang Nie,Guojie Xiao,Su Pan,Biao Wang,Huilin Ge,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces new algorithms for generating adversarial examples significantly different from original dataset samples but yielding the same model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks by introducing a concept of adversarial examples that maintain the same output while differing significantly from original inputs.

Method: The authors developed algorithms such as NI-FGSM, NI-FGM, and their momentum-based variants (NMI-FGSM, NMI-FGM) to construct these adversarial examples.

Result: The generated adversarial examples were found to be broadly distributed in the sample space and not limited to a dataset's immediate neighborhood.

Conclusion: These adversarial examples can have significant implications for machine learning system security, highlighting the need for robust defense measures while offering new methods of exploration in adversarial techniques.

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current variable selection heuristics in B&B solvers significantly impact their performance. The motivation is to improve these heuristics using RL-based approaches for optimal branching policies.

Method: The authors develop BBMDP, a vanilla MDP formulation tailored to variable selection in B&B, enabling the application of various reinforcement learning algorithms.

Result: Computational experiments demonstrate that the BBMDP-based branching agent outperforms previous RL-based methods on four MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: BBMDP proves to be an effective framework for learning optimal variable selection heuristics, marking progress in RL applications within NP-hard optimization problems.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

### [245] [LMFD: Latent Monotonic Feature Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19383)
*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to identify proxies for latent 'age' in multi-variate time series data by optimizing monotonicity using formulas generated through a defined grammar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of extracting latent 'age' information from sensor data in systems that evolve or degrade over time, which can help understand their progression when direct age data is unavailable.

Method: The method involves optimizing generated equations for monotonicity (absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation) and assessing their suitability as proxies for 'age' using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: The system successfully combines sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with higher monotonicity in experiments, notably achieving a Spearman's correlation of 0.95 for InfraWatch data from two weak sensors.

Conclusion: The methodology proves capable of discovering interpretable equations that serve as proxies for the latent 'age' of systems, showcasing its potential for structural health monitoring and similar applications.

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ADAligner, a dynamic framework for graph-text alignment designed to address the limitations of existing CLIP-style aligners by adjusting between many-to-many and one-to-one strategies based on data quality. It achieves robustness, faster pre-training, and improved performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-text alignment methods assume strict correspondences and rely on static objectives, which fail to address noisy data and overlook many-to-many relationships in real-world graphs.

Method: ADAligner dynamically adjusts between expressive many-to-many and conservative one-to-one alignment strategies based on real-time estimation of supervision quality, promoting flexible and reliable optimization.

Result: ADAligner consistently outperforms prior methods in node classification, link prediction, and cross-modal retrieval tasks across nine datasets. It demonstrates robustness to noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by 2-3 times.

Conclusion: ADAligner provides a scalable and reliable solution for graph-text alignment in web-scale applications, improving pre-training efficiency and robustness while handling data diversity and noise effectively.

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

### [247] [CPSVD: Enhancing Large Language Model Compression via Column-Preserving Singular Value Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19385)
*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Li,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CPSVD, a method to enhance LLM compression efficiency by preserving columns with high decomposition errors and adaptively managing compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The huge size of LLMs leads to inefficiencies, necessitating advanced compression methods. Existing SVD approaches fail to account for varying matrix decomposition errors.

Method: CPSVD refines SVD by identifying high-error columns, preserving them directly, and segmenting matrices to balance compression strategies. It also adapts non-uniform compression rates across LLM layers.

Result: CPSVD achieves superior performance over existing SVD compression methods, with reduced perplexity and increased accuracy in zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: CPSVD improves LLM compression by addressing matrix heterogeneity and error variation, offering a more efficient and effective solution to reduce LLM size.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

### [248] [ARA: Adaptive Rank Allocation for Efficient Large Language Model SVD Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19389)
*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA) method to improve large language model (LLM) compression using singular value decomposition (SVD), addressing major limitations in existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of LLM compression through SVD while overcoming limitations like suboptimal local minima caused by heuristic algorithms and the inability to capture singular value spectra relationships effectively.

Method: The Adaptive Rank Allocation (ARA) method introduces a specialized mask design for efficient rank allocation and an additional loss function for globally optimal parameter selection.

Result: ARA achieves significant performance improvements, reducing perplexity from 8.38 to 6.42 on the LLaMA2-7B model with an 80% compression ratio, and enhancing zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared to uniform compression.

Conclusion: ARA proves highly effective for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression by addressing critical limitations, leading to improved perplexity and accuracy in compressed language models.

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

### [249] [Iterative Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier-enhanced Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19399)
*Yulun Wu,Miguel Aguiar,Karl H. Johansson,Matthieu Barreau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IFeF-PINN, a method to tackle spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks by incorporating high-frequency features through Random Fourier Features, improving the network's approximation of high-frequency PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) face limitations due to spectral bias, which hinders their ability to learn high-frequency features effectively. This creates challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that have high-frequency components.

Method: The authors propose IFeF-PINN, which iteratively trains PINNs using Fourier-enhanced features. The approach enriches the network's latent space with high-frequency components from Random Fourier Features, creating a two-stage training process: estimating a feature space basis and regression to determine coefficients.

Result: The method is demonstrated to provide improved expressive capacity for approximating high-frequency PDEs. Extensive benchmarks show that IFeF-PINN outperforms existing algorithms across classical problems, achieving superior results in terms of accuracy and frequency domain coverage.

Conclusion: The IFeF-PINN algorithm effectively overcomes spectral bias in PINNs, allowing for more accurate and efficient learning of high-frequency PDEs. This advancement establishes it as a strong alternative to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

### [250] [FairNet: Dynamic Fairness Correction without Performance Loss via Contrastive Conditional LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19421)
*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet is a framework designed to improve fairness in machine learning models by dynamically addressing bias at the instance level without negatively impacting overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing debiasing methods, such as trade-offs in performance, static correction, and challenges with data sparsity and suboptimal use of sensitive attributes in fairness correction.

Method: FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to dynamically and selectively apply fairness corrections. Additionally, it features a novel contrastive loss function tailored for minimizing disparities across different sensitive groups.

Result: FairNet improves the performance of the worst-performing group, maintains overall model performance, and even introduces slight performance improvements. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on various vision and language datasets.

Conclusion: FairNet provides a practical and flexible solution to machine learning fairness by balancing dynamic bias correction with performance optimization, even under incomplete or fully absent sensitive attribute labels.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

### [251] [LLM Unlearning with LLM Beliefs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19422)
*Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Yue Wang,Fengpeng Li,Jun Liu,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to enhance unlearning in large language models to counter memorized harmful or sensitive content by addressing associated issues called the squeezing effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem where unlearning methods often result in spurious outcomes due to redistribution of probability mass to semantically related rephrasings.

Method: The proposed bootstrapping (BS) framework integrates model beliefs to suppress probability mass redistribution effect during unlearning. Two methods, BS-T (token-level) and BS-S (sequence-level), aim to reduce high-probability target responses effectively.

Result: The approach successfully mitigates the squeezing effect while preserving model utility, supported by robust experimental results across benchmarks and model families.

Conclusion: BS framework offers a significant improvement in unlearning capability, effectively countering challenges associated with prior methods while ensuring model performance remains unaffected.

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Insu Jeon,Youngjin Park,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs), a meta-learning framework that models task-specific dropout rates to achieve robust few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a robust Bayesian meta-learning framework that efficiently infers the conditional posterior for effective few-shot learning across diverse tasks.

Method: NVDPs leverage a task-specific dropout model with a low-rank Bernoulli product meta-model for memory-efficient mappings, combined with a novel task-data conditioned prior for optimizing an amortized variational inference process.

Result: NVDPs achieve superior performance compared to existing meta-learning methods in tasks like 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the significance of NVDPs for robust task reconfiguration and uncertainty adaptability, making it a highly effective approach for few-shot meta-learning.

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

*M. Klabunde,L. Caspari,F. Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper revisits the universality hypothesis of adversarially robust models, highlighting its partial validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the generality of the modified universality hypothesis regarding adversarially robust models.

Method: Experiments conducted to compare representational similarity and predictive behavior across varying datasets and models.

Result: Findings reveal inconsistent representational similarity and prediction divergence across datasets, locating variance in the classification layer.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness contributes to partial universality, but strict universality is not supported; retraining classifiers aids in achieving better universality.

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: g-DPO enhances the scalability of Direct Preference Optimization for protein language models, maintaining performance with significantly faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability bottleneck in using Direct Preference Optimization for aligning protein language models with experimental goals while handling large datasets.

Method: Introduced g-DPO framework which utilizes sequence space clustering to reduce redundant pairs and employs group-based likelihood approximations for efficient computation.

Result: g-DPO reduces training time by 1.8 to 3.7 times while achieving equivalent in-silico and in-vitro performance compared to standard DPO.

Conclusion: g-DPO effectively scales DPO for larger datasets by optimizing training pair selection and computation, making it well-suited for protein engineering tasks without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

### [255] [A Concrete Roadmap towards Safety Cases based on Chain-of-Thought Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19476)
*Julian Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a safety roadmap for AI reasoning models based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring, discussing threats to monitorability and methods to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems with dangerous capabilities cannot rely solely on traditional safety measures, necessitating innovative assurance methods like CoT monitoring.

Method: The authors suggest a two-part safety approach: first, ensuring reasoning models without CoT lack dangerous capabilities, and second, detecting dangers enabled by CoT through monitoring. They also categorize threats to monitorability, analyze techniques for enhancing CoT faithfulness, and examine methods to extract monitorable CoTs.

Result: Key methods for CoT monitoring were evaluated, threats to safety were explored, and prediction markets were established to forecast the feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: CoT monitoring could support trustworthiness and control-based safety cases, and further research on monitorability and potential methods is crucial.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

*Qiang Chen,Zhongze Wu,Ang He,Xi Lin,Shuo Jiang,Shan You,Chang Xu,Yi Chen,Xiu Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes INPO, a framework designed to enhance graph unlearning models by slowing divergence speed and maintaining robustness during unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address utility degradation in existing graph unlearning models caused by rapid divergence during the gradient ascent process.

Method: The framework introduces influence-aware negative preference optimization, including influence-aware message functions, removal-based influence estimation, and topological entropy loss.

Result: Experiments on five real-world datasets confirm that INPO outperforms existing approaches on forget quality metrics while preserving model utility.

Conclusion: INPO enhances unlearning robustness and performance, setting a new standard in graph unlearning efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELUTQ introduces Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ) for efficient low-bit quantization of Large Language Models on edge devices, optimizing memory usage and inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices constrained by memory and computational resources, focusing on reducing memory and latency bottlenecks.

Method: Developed ELUTQ framework with Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ), aligning better with weight distributions while avoiding the overhead of dequantization. Integrated optimized CPU kernels for efficient inference operations.

Result: HLQ significantly reduces perplexity (by up to 85% at 2-bit precision) in post-training quantization, achieves quick quantization and finetuning while delivering high inference efficiency on edge devices.

Conclusion: ELUTQ's HLQ facilitates effective LLM inference on CPU-based edge devices, balancing accuracy and efficiency, making on-device intelligence accessible and practical.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpikeQuant, a system utilizing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for energy-efficient quantization in large language models, achieving comparable accuracy while significantly reducing energy cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of energy consumption, latency, and clipping salient values in edge device deployment of large language models using weight-activation quantization.

Method: SpikeQuant uses binary spike counts and integrates quantization scales into the Spiking Neural Networks' threshold mechanism for mixed-precision, energy-efficient computation, avoiding dequantization.

Result: SpikeQuant achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization, reducing energy cost up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SpikeQuant effectively supports accurate and energy-efficient deployment of large language models on edge devices, addressing key limitations of traditional quantization techniques.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for improving LLM hallucination detection by combining responses from multiple LLMs instead of relying on just a single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of large language models that result in hallucinations due to imperfect training data, such as biases and underrepresented information.

Method: The authors propose and evaluate a 'consortium consistency' approach that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs with varying training schemes, architectures, and data sources.

Result: The 'consortium consistency' method significantly improves hallucination detection and mitigation compared to single-model approaches while often reducing inference costs.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that teaming different LLMs together can enhance performance in hallucination detection and offset drawbacks of single-model consistency approaches, such as inference costs.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of explainability in state-of-the-art models, especially for critical domains like healthcare, where actionable insights are vital.

Method: The framework employs SHAP thresholds to identify critical ECG signal segments, uses DTW and medoid clustering for prototype extraction, and aligns prototypes with ECG signals for coherence. It offers three variants to refine counterfactual generation.

Result: Counterfactuals modify 78% of the signal and retain 81.3% validity, with enhanced temporal stability (43% improvement). Near-real-time generation is achieved (<1 second), yielding class-dependent performance ranging from 98.9% to 13.2%.

Conclusion: The paper introduces physiologically-aware, sparse counterfactual explanations, contributing design principles for user-driven AI explanations in clinical diagnosis systems, with potential for interactive deployment.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

TL;DR: The study proposes Bi-level Decision-Focused Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) to address challenges in marketing strategies for optimizing user retention and revenue. It improves decision-making by aligning machine learning predictions with optimization objectives and balancing observational and experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in using machine learning and optimization in marketing strategies for online platforms, such as prediction-decision misalignment and the bias-variance tradeoff in data.

Method: Bi-DFCL combines an unbiased estimator for decision quality with a bi-level optimization framework that integrates observational and experimental data through implicit differentiation.

Result: The method demonstrated improved performance in benchmarks, industrial datasets, and online A/B tests, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and has been deployed at Meituan.

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL systematically handles prediction-decision misalignment and bias-variance issues, advancing the field of marketing strategies for online platforms.

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

*Ruiyao Miao,Junren Xiao,Shiya Tsang,Hui Xiong,Yingnian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes REBMBO, a novel approach to Bayesian Optimization (BO) that integrates Gaussian Processes with an Energy-Based Model to overcome traditional BO limitations, optimized via Proximal Policy Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Optimization commonly suffers from one-step bias, hampering its performance in complex tasks. The authors are motivated to improve BO methods by addressing these shortcomings and integrating advancements from Black-Box Optimization.

Method: The authors introduce REBMBO, which combines Gaussian Processes for local search with an Energy-Based Model for understanding global structures, leveraging Proximal Policy Optimization to formulate iterative BO steps as a Markov Decision Process for multi-step optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments, both on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, show REBMBO's superior performance in adapting to different GP setups and consistently achieving robust and adaptable results.

Conclusion: REBMBO surpasses traditional BO methods by effectively mitigating one-step bias through adaptive lookahead exploration, demonstrating robustness and high performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel control strategy called MED-LQ based on the Confusing Instance principle for model-based reinforcement learning in linear systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of classic methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling in controlling systems with unknown dynamics.

Method: Introduces MED-LQ, leveraging the Minimum Empirical Divergence principle along with LQR policy structure, sensitivity, and stability analysis.

Result: MED-LQ benchmarks show competitive performance across multiple control scenarios with potential scalability to large-scale problems.

Conclusion: MED-LQ extends CI and MED principles, offering a scalable approach for reinforcement learning in linear systems and broader applicability in MDPs.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the application of federated learning (FL) in clustering distributed pharmaceutical molecular data while evaluating its efficiency with chemistry-informed metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods for drug discovery rely heavily on public datasets, which lack the scale and diversity of proprietary pharmaceutical data, motivating the usage of privacy-preserving FL for industrial adoption.

Method: Three federated clustering methods (Fed-kMeans, Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans, and Fed-LSH) are benchmarked using diverse molecular datasets. A novel chemistry-informed evaluation metric, SF-ICF, is introduced for analysis.

Result: Federated clustering methods performed comparatively with centralized approaches, and demonstrated the significance of domain-specific metrics and explainability in analyzing molecular diversity.

Conclusion: FL, combined with domain-specific evaluation, offers a viable pathway for privacy-preserving, collaborative drug discovery efforts in the pharmaceutical industry.

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

*Jinpyo Hong,Rachel E. Baker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ForecastNet-XCL, a hybrid ML model for long-term forecasting of endemic diseases like RSV, leveraging climate and temporal data, and achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accurate forecasting tools for endemic diseases, particularly those that do not rely on real-time surveillance data, and improve public health response capabilities.

Method: The paper presents ForecastNet-XCL, a hybrid deep learning framework based on XGBoost, CNN, and BiLSTM. It uses high-resolution feature learning, long-range temporal dependency capturing, and an autoregressive module trained on climate-related data, incorporating probabilistic inference for decision-making.

Result: ForecastNet-XCL outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural networks, and traditional ensemble methods across 34 U.S. states, demonstrating robust accuracy even in regions with irregular disease patterns.

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL is an efficient and reliable early-warning forecasting tool capable of addressing challenges such as climate variability and limited surveillance data, suitable for deployment in public health systems.

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

*Jin Han,Zhe Zheng,Yi Gu,Jia-Rui Lin,Xin-Zheng Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffEvac introduces an efficient evacuation simulation method using Generative Models (GMs), yielding faster and more accurate results compared to traditional techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of traditional evacuation simulations in early building design stages, particularly their heavy reliance on complex modeling with numerous parameters.

Method: The study created a dataset of 399 diverse layouts and corresponding heatmaps, proposed a decoupled feature representation to incorporate physical features, and utilized a diffusion model with image prompts to learn evacuation patterns.

Result: DiffEvac showed a 37.6% improvement in SSIM, a 142% improvement in PSNR, and reduced simulation time to 2 minutes, outperforming Conditional GAN-based approaches.

Conclusion: The method speeds up design iterations, reduces modeling complexity, enables large-scale exploration, and facilitates integration with multi-objective design tools, contributing to enhanced building safety and intelligent safety optimization pathways.

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of least squares in modern machine learning by deriving custom gradients and using it as a differentiable operator for diverse applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to exploit the underutilized potential of the least squares method in modern machine learning by transforming it into a versatile tool beyond linear model fitting.

Method: Custom gradients are derived to make the least squares solver a differentiable operator, with applications integrated into various machine learning tasks.

Result: Experimental demonstrations include scalability, constraints in generative models, and hyperparameter tuning in Gaussian processes.

Conclusion: The work advances differentiable linear-algebra tools, enhancing their accessibility and utility for machine learning practitioners.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FVAE-LoRA enhances Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) using a Factorized Variational Autoencoder to improve task-salient features and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods lack explicit mechanisms to disambiguate task-relevant information, potentially hindering downstream performance.

Method: The authors propose FVAE-LoRA, utilizing a Variational Autoencoder with a specific Evidence Lower Bound formulation to factorize latent spaces into task-salient and residual information.

Result: FVAE-LoRA demonstrates superior performance over standard LoRA across multiple domains (text, audio, image) and excels under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA enhances task-relevant signal isolation, improving robustness and downstream results in a parameter-efficient manner.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

### [269] [Overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner for treatment effect estimation over time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19643)
*Konstantin Hess,Dennis Frauen,Mihaela van der Schaar,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel meta-learner (WO-learner) to improve estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings by addressing treatment overlap issues and variance instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Treatment sequences in time-varying settings often suffer from low overlap due to the diminishing probability of observing them. This leads to unreliable estimations of HTEs due to high variance in existing meta-learners.

Method: The authors propose the overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO) meta-learner, which targets regions with high treatment sequence overlap. It optimizes a Neyman-orthogonal population risk function and can integrate with any machine learning model.

Result: The WO-learner demonstrates robustness against nuisance function misspecification and improved estimation stability. Experiments using models like transformers and LSTMs highlight its advantages.

Conclusion: The WO-learner provides a reliable, model-agnostic framework for estimating HTEs in time-varying scenarios effectively, addressing the challenge of low treatment overlap and variance instability.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

TL;DR: TraDy is a novel transfer learning method designed for memory-efficient training of deep neural networks using dynamic stochastic channel selection and pre-determined architecture-dependent layer importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for memory-efficient training of increasingly larger deep neural networks in scenarios with stringent resource constraints.

Method: The authors propose TraDy, which uses an architecture-dependent, a priori layer importance evaluation and stochastic resampling of channels in predetermined layers during each epoch.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks and architectures, along with notable memory efficiency: achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs.

Conclusion: TraDy effectively combines layer importance determination and dynamic channel selection, enabling superior performance and significant memory efficiency in deep neural network tasks.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative
computation.

*Amir Globerson,Haim Kaplan,Yishay Mansour,Clara Mohri,Tal Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a method to improve text generation speed in transformer models by utilizing a hierarchy of draft models for token verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face high inference latency due to the sequential token generation. Faster methods are needed without quality compromise.

Method: HSD organizes multiple draft models into a hierarchy, where tokens are progressively verified by increasingly larger models before reaching the target model. An algorithm selects the latency-optimal hierarchy.

Result: HSD achieves up to 1.2x speed improvement in text generation compared to other single-draft methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding is effective for reducing latency in text generation while maintaining high output quality, and its latency-optimal configuration can be determined efficiently.

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO is a lightweight time series foundation model aimed at balancing effectiveness and computational efficiency, achieving strong performance with reduced pretraining demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models have substantial size and pre-training requirements, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments. SEMPO addresses the tradeoff between model versatility and affordability.

Method: SEMPO consists of two modules: (1) an energy-aware spectral decomposition module which models both high-energy and low-energy frequency signals, and (2) a mixture-of-prompts Transformer which adapts to diverse datasets and domains via prompt-based expertise routing.

Result: SEMPO demonstrated superior performance in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting on two large-scale benchmarks encompassing 16 datasets.

Conclusion: SEMPO achieves a balance between reduced data and model scale and strong performance, paving the way for efficient time series forecasting in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in evaluating predictive models for critical care scenarios and ensure privacy in handling EHR data.

Method: The authors enhance diffusion-based generators with distribution-alignment penalties to better emulate real data, benchmarking extensively on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets.

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff significantly reduces the real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation discrepancy, improves subgroup AUROC estimation accuracy, and increases utility with reduced TRTS gap.

Conclusion: The framework facilitates trustworthy model evaluations for critical care, ensuring robust analysis across diverse populations while preserving privacy.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

*Catherine Villeneuve,Benjamin Akera,Mélisande Teng,David Rolnick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian deep learning framework, BATIS, to improve species distribution models (SDMs) in data-scarce locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDMs face limitations in effectiveness due to spatial biases in observational data.

Method: The authors introduced BATIS, a Bayesian framework utilizing iterative updates on prior predictions using observational data, while incorporating uncertainty quantification approaches.

Result: Empirical studies showed that Bayesian deep learning approaches significantly enhance the reliability of SDMs, especially in regions with limited data.

Conclusion: The proposed BATIS framework can better combine local and broader ecological patterns, contributing to improved ecological understanding and conservation initiatives.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

*Qilin Ye,Deqing Fu,Robin Jia,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes why Transformers fail to generalize, showing that their learned strategies depend heavily on training data being within their capacity limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why Transformers rely on fragile heuristics instead of learning reliable algorithms, using graph connectivity tasks as a testing ground.

Method: A theoretical and empirical study is conducted on a simplified Transformer architecture. It considers both model capacity defined via graph diameter and its impact on training dynamics using adjacency matrix computation.

Result: Training instances within the model's capacity lead to correct algorithm learning, while beyond-capacity examples lead to heuristic-based learning.

Conclusion: Restricting training data to within a Transformer's algorithmic capacity improves the model's generalizability by enabling it to learn accurate algorithms rather than heuristics.

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations are crucial for model interpretability and actionable recourse, but existing methods often neglect predictive uncertainty, leading to potential unreliability.

Method: CONFEX utilizes Conformal Prediction, Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, and a novel localized CP procedure with tree-based partitioning to ensure local coverage guarantees.

Result: CONFEX demonstrates superior robustness and plausibility in generating uncertainty-aware explanations compared to state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: CONFEX provides reliable counterfactual explanations with formal guarantees in predictive uncertainty and optimality, advancing the interpretability and reliability of model decision-making.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion Models are powerful for generative AI but face computational challenges for real-time use. Diffusion Caching is introduced to improve efficiency without modifying model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reducing computational overhead and latency in Diffusion Models to make generative AI feasible for real-time applications.

Method: This study systematically reviews Diffusion Caching techniques which reuse computational redundancies intrinsically present in the diffusion process for efficiency without altering model structure.

Result: Diffusion Caching evolves from static reuse to dynamic prediction, showcasing flexibility across tasks and potential integrations with other acceleration techniques to optimize generative processes.

Conclusion: Diffusion Caching is a promising advancement for making generative AI efficient. It is expected to play a key role in achieving real-time multimodal and interactive applications in the field of efficient generative intelligence.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

### [278] [The Tail Tells All: Estimating Model-Level Membership Inference Vulnerability Without Reference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19773)
*Euodia Dodd,Nataša Krčo,Igor Shilov,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for estimating model-level vulnerability to membership inference attacks without relying on reference models, by analyzing loss distributions and observing the absence of outliers in high-loss regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current membership inference attacks, used to assess AI model privacy risks, require expensive computational resources and reference models, making them impractical.

Method: Analyzes loss distributions, leveraging asymmetry and heavy tails to detect absence of outliers in high-loss regions, enabling estimation of model-level vulnerability using only training and testing data.

Result: The proposed method accurately estimates vulnerability to state-of-the-art membership inference attacks (LiRA), outperforming other low-cost attacks like RMIA and measures of distribution differences.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical tool for assessing AI model privacy risks, showing promise especially for evaluating risks in large language models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

### [279] [GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19778)
*Anand Choudhary,Yasser Sulaıman,Lukas Mauch,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene,Fabien Cardinaux,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP is a novel sparse fine-tuning method that prioritizes parameters with significant gradient magnitudes and low pre-trained values for task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse adaptation of large language models depends on optimal selection of parameters for efficiency and task relevance.

Method: GaLLoP selects model parameters that are highly task-relevant but minimally disruptive by focusing on large gradient magnitudes and small pre-trained magnitudes.

Result: With LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B models, GaLLoP improves or matches performance of leading tuning techniques, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and achieving stable results across random seeds.

Conclusion: GaLLoP enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning by balancing between preserving pre-trained knowledge and adapting to task-specific demands, showing robustness in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

*Shixuan Liu,Yue He,Haotian Wang,Wenjing Yang,Yunfei Wang,Peng Cui,Zhong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaInfer introduces a method to infer environment specifications from prediction errors in fixed neural networks, addressing challenges in scenarios without environment labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods that rely on unavailable environment labels during training, particularly in public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains.

Method: A novel algorithm (DynaInfer) that analyzes prediction errors from neural networks within each training round to infer environment specifications.

Result: The method effectively addresses the alternating optimization problem in unlabeled scenarios and showcases superior performance compared to existing techniques, even under labeled conditions.

Conclusion: DynaInfer is a robust and efficient solution that improves dynamical system analysis in situations of incomplete or unavailable environment label data.

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

*Rohith Kuditipudi,Jing Huang,Sally Zhu,Diyi Yang,Christopher Potts,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether one can statistically prove that a derivative language model originated from another trained model, using methods that test correlations with training data orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of proving that a derivative model or text is based on another's trained language model.

Method: The authors use independence testing, leveraging palimpsestic memorization and randomized data shuffling to establish statistical correlation between derivative models and original training data orders.

Result: They achieved highly significant statistical evidence (e.g., p-value 1e-8) demonstrating correlations in derivative models, particularly in query settings. Two observational methods showed varying effectiveness at detecting the derivative model's use of the original data.

Conclusion: Their methodology provides a reliable statistical framework for detecting and proving derivative use, highlighting its effectiveness even with limited or extensive text input depending on the method used.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

### [282] [Transformers are almost optimal metalearners for linear classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19797)
*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that transformers can function as near-optimal metalearners for linear classification tasks by leveraging a shared subspace among tasks, requiring minimal in-context examples for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if transformers can act as efficient metalearners, solving related tasks more effectively than tackling them individually, and leveraging limited in-context data.

Method: Analyzed a simplified transformer trained via gradient descent in a setup involving class-conditional Gaussian tasks sharing a subspace. The study derived performance bounds under in-context learning conditions.

Result: The transformer generalized to new tasks using only O(k/R^4) in-context examples, closely matching optimal learners' efficiency and outperforming learners reliant solely on in-context data.

Conclusion: Transformers are capable of near-optimal metalearning in linear classification tasks when trained on a sufficient number of related tasks, demonstrating efficient generalization despite limited data.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the feasibility of large-scale language model training in Brazil and Mexico, focusing on constrained hardware, energy, and fiscal limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural inequalities in AI capabilities between high-income and Global South nations, and explore how middle-income countries can independently establish AI capabilities.

Method: Analyzed compute demand, energy consumption, costs, and regulatory constraints for training a 10-trillion-token model under different hardware and timeline conditions.

Result: H100 configurations were found to be cost-effective ($8-14M), while A100 configurations were more expensive ($19-32M). Extending training durations can mitigate hardware constraints.

Conclusion: The study provides strategies for middle-income countries to achieve AI technological sovereignty, emphasizing context-specific solutions for sustainable AI governance.

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

*James C. Knight,Johanna Senk,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework for GPU-accelerated structural plasticity in sparse Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which significantly reduces training time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current machine learning frameworks, which focus on dense connectivity and fail to leverage structural plasticity for efficient training and resource optimization.

Method: The authors propose a GPU-accelerated framework for implementing structural plasticity in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), applying it with both supervised (e-prop rule) and unsupervised learning approaches.

Result: The framework reduced training time by up to 10x compared to dense models while preserving model performance, successfully demonstrated sparse SNN classifiers, and enabled real-time topographic map simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework paves the way for further exploration of sparse neural network structures and communication, offering computational benefits for various neuromorphic applications.

Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity,
where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections.
However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections
are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning
but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by
structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak
connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of
inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for
backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce
the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports
efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational
neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework
for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate
this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train
efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning
context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our
sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring
enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate
topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights
into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network
size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and
maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as
exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic
applications.

TL;DR: TLLC extends the Two-Level Linear dependent type theory (TLL) with dependent session types for verifying concurrent programs and protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance dependency in session types to enable relational verification and correctness lifting between sequential and concurrent programs.

Method: Develop intuitionistic session type formulation, integrate it into TLL, study its meta-theory, and build a prototype TLLC compiler.

Result: Demonstrates soundness through meta-theory, and evaluation of a prototype compiler that generates concurrent C code.

Conclusion: TLLC provides a robust framework for verifying correctness in protocols, data structures, and algorithms in concurrent programming, with potential applicability in other type systems.

Abstract: We present TLLC which extends the Two-Level Linear dependent type theory
(TLL) with session-based concurrency. Equipped with Martin-L\"{o}f style
dependency, the session types of TLLC allow protocols to specify properties of
communicated messages. When used in conjunction with the dependent type
machinery already present in TLL, dependent session types facilitate a form of
relational verification by relating concurrent programs with their idealized
sequential counterparts. Correctness properties proven for sequential programs
can be easily lifted to their corresponding concurrent implementations. TLLC
makes session types a powerful tool for intrinsically verifying the correctness
of data structures such as queues and concurrent algorithms such as map-reduce.
To extend TLL with session types, we develop a novel formulation of
intuitionistic session type which we believe to be widely applicable for
integrating session types into other type systems beyond the context of TLLC.
We study the meta-theory of our language, proving its soundness as both a term
calculus and a process calculus. To demonstrate the practicality of TLLC, we
have implemented a prototype compiler that translates TLLC programs into
concurrent C code, which has been extensively evaluated.

TL;DR: The abstract discusses a terrain mapping framework for quadruped robots to explore lunar Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) using proprioceptive sensing to improve interaction with uneven terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PSRs near the lunar poles are of interest due to their potential to contain valuable scientific resources like water ice and geological records. Current approaches face challenges in complex terrains, making legged robots an optimal solution.

Method: The framework uses proprioceptive sensors to estimate key terrain metrics such as elevation, slippage, energy costs, and stability. These metrics are integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap.

Result: Evaluation in a simulator representing lunar conditions shows that the quadruped robot 'Aliengo' consistently performs well in mapping uneven terrain under lunar gravity.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of quadruped robots with proprioceptive sensing to explore challenging lunar terrains effectively, supporting future lunar exploration missions.

Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for
future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve
geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged
robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data,
and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped
with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can
capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify
its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by
proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped
robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability
margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are
incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain
interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a
simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot
Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper explores the novel use of compact 3D sonar for underwater state estimation, providing methodologies for calibration and assessments in challenging underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater environments lack robust state-estimation options due to limitations in electromagnetic wave propagation and reliance on 2D acoustic range sensors; thus, exploring novel compact 3D sonar technology is crucial.

Method: Introduced calibration procedures for 3D sonar-camera extrinsics, studied acoustic responses across various materials, and developed mapping and SLAM pipelines tested in underwater caves and complex environments.

Result: The study demonstrates that 3D sonars generate consistent spatial data, enabling detailed reconstructions and localization over large-scale datasets, while also revealing acoustic propagation challenges.

Conclusion: Compact 3D sonar shows significant promise for underwater state estimation, although further research is needed to address acoustic propagation issues. Shared datasets aim to support community advancements.

Abstract: In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs,
has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a
standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor
propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the
visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to
acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best,
spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising
from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that
purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics
between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response
in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and
SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other
geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our
assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent
spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in
datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights
remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other
acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and
shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of compact sensors for underwater robots hinders advancements in autonomous navigation compared to terrestrial and aerial settings.

Method: SHRUMS uses 3D sonar and introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements to optimize navigation performance in real-time.

Result: SHRUMS demonstrates robustness in challenging 3D environments with poor visibility and validated real 3D sonar sensor data.

Conclusion: SHRUMS represents a significant step forward in underwater autonomous navigation and is planned for full field deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite
major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range
sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for
underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D
sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called
SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D
Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater
autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline
exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite
of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the
novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,
SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from
non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to
application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with
real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and
local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed
approach in full are planned in the very near future.

TL;DR: The paper introduces \nabla-SDF, a hybrid method combining explicit gradient-augmented octree interpolation with implicit neural residuals to achieve efficient and accurate signed distance function (SDF) reconstruction from point cloud data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations of existing methods for estimating signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data, such as lack of continuity, inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, and memory issues in large-scale environments.

Method: The work proposes \nabla-SDF, a hybrid approach that integrates gradient-augmented octree interpolation (explicit prior) with neural network-based residuals (implicit) to achieve high-fidelity, non-truncated, and differentiable SDF reconstruction.

Result: The proposed method delivers both computational and memory efficiency on par with traditional volumetric approaches while retaining the high accuracy and differentiability associated with neural network methods.

Conclusion: \nabla-SDF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable and robust solution for tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the feasibility of achieving smooth and efficient motion for constrained robots by explicitly incorporating steering limits and velocity transitions into motion planning and control design.

Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel
drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints
prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The
configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities
that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that
partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We
further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance
that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition
smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation
from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing
by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement
the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and
evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

*Fausto Vega,Jon Arrizabalaga,Ryan Watson,Zachary Manchester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents an algorithm to automate spacecraft collision avoidance in low-Earth orbit through an optimized maneuver planning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spacecraft collision avoidance relies on manual, time-intensive processes, and with the increasing satellite density in low-Earth orbit, autonomous and efficient methods are urgently needed.

Method: The problem is modeled as a nonconvex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), relaxed into a convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation to obtain globally optimal, minimum-energy collision-avoidance maneuvers.

Result: Simulations demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in calculating optimal maneuvers that reduce collision risk while adhering to energy and safety constraints.

Conclusion: This novel approach facilitates autonomous, energy-efficient spacecraft collision avoidance, addressing the growing challenges posed by high satellite densities in low-Earth orbit.

Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance
remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated
forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of
satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for
efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an
algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term
conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a
convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate
empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of
globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation
produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of
collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability
of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty,
yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a
high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a
simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing collision risk.

Result: Simulations showed precision improvements, with RMSE of $6.14 × 10^{-4}$ m and settling time of $3.2$s. Experiments confirmed real-time applicability with RMSE of $5.66 × 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 × 10^{-3}$ m, and settling time of $1.58$s.

Conclusion: The NN-MRAC enhances motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic systems, demonstrating potential for advancing adaptive intelligent control in assistive devices.

Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by
the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control
strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which
impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this
study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model
Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist
integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is
formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending
deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from
deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online
adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s.
Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE
of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and
settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the
controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic

Method: The study employs a sample-based variation of integer optimization to explore and identify optimal solutions in hybrid mode control domains.

Result: The approach demonstrates strong performance guarantees and successfully applies to robotics tasks requiring reactive mode switching and synthesis of complex algorithms.

Conclusion: This solution enhances robotics capabilities by enabling effective mode transitions and control strategies, shown in real-world robotic examples.

Abstract: This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control
problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach
reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization
problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and
the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation
is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We
find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied
to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to
synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve
challenging tasks. Last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
real-world robotic examples that require reactive switching between long-term
planning and high-frequency control.

Conclusion: The proposed system aids scalability and reproducibility in autonomous laboratories, supporting reliable human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics and autonomous systems have broadened the use of
robots in laboratory settings, including automated synthesis, scalable reaction

capability enables the system to accommodate variations in object orientation
and supports robust autonomous manipulation across diverse environments. By
enabling autonomous experimentation and human-robot collaboration, this work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of enabling legged robots to safely navigate deformable or unstable terrains where visual sensing fails.

Method: SAEGT employs Gaussian Process regression to assess traversability based on leg-terrain interactions, coupled with a reactive controller for real-time navigation.

Result: SAEGT successfully demonstrated safe exploration and navigation toward goals in simulation, relying solely on proprioceptive traversability estimates.

Conclusion: SAEGT enhances safe navigation and exploration capabilities for legged robots in challenging granular environments, bypassing limits of visual input.

Abstract: Legged robots can sense terrain through force interactions during locomotion,
offering more reliable traversability estimates than remote sensing and serving
as scouts for guiding wheeled rovers in challenging environments. However, even
legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable
terrain. We present Safe Active Exploration for Granular Terrain (SAEGT), a
navigation framework that enables legged robots to safely explore unknown
granular environments using proprioceptive sensing, particularly where visual
input fails to capture terrain deformability. SAEGT estimates the safe region
and frontier region online from leg-terrain interactions using Gaussian Process
regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for
real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to
safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively
estimated traversability in simulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GADGET, a planning model for robotic systems that ensures efficient, safe, and transferable path planning in cluttered environments without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve generalization and adaptability of robotic path planning methods to unseen environments and new robots, addressing computational inefficiency and limited generalization in conventional and prior learning-based approaches.

Method: A diffusion-based model named GADGET uses dual-conditioning to generate safe trajectories, combining learned scene encoding and Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping during trajectory denoising.

Result: GADGET achieves high safety and success rates across diverse environments and robot configurations, outperforming prior baselines, with successful real-world execution.

Conclusion: GADGET demonstrates adaptability to new robots and environments, ensuring safe trajectory generation without retraining, and offers a strong, efficient method in robotic path planning.

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments
needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and
hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive
parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize
effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning
framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic
manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable
and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a
diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories
conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal
configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism
that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with
classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating
environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the
denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments
and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that
GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in
spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance
further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong
performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.
Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3
(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates
its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robotic grasping that rely on complete 3D data face challenges due to limited data quality in practical scenarios.

Method: The method involves synthesizing physically plausible images of hand-object interactions using 3D Gaussian Splatting, allowing end-to-end training with RGB input and refining predictions with a photometric loss.

Result: GRASPLAT improves robotic grasp success rates by up to 36.9% compared to existing image-based approaches.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the effectiveness of GRASPLAT in achieving more accurate and successful robotic grasping using RGB-based methods, providing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses deformable linear object (DLO) routing tasks using a hierarchical framework combining vision-language models (VLMs) and reinforcement learning to achieve high success rates in long-horizon industrial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenges involved in long-duration routing tasks of deformable linear objects, which require non-linear dynamic adaptation, multi-step planning, and skill execution for real-world applications such as assembly lines.

Method: The proposed method uses a hierarchical framework leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for high-level reasoning and reinforcement learning-enabled low-level skills. A failure recovery mechanism is introduced to enhance robustness.

Result: The framework achieves a 92.5% success rate across long-horizon routing scenarios and outperforms the baseline method by nearly 50%, showcasing its adaptability across diverse scenes and commands.

Conclusion: The hierarchical framework is effective in solving complex DLO routing tasks, combining reasoning from vision-language models and reliable execution via reinforcement learning, marking advancements in autonomy and generalization.

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces TARMAC, a framework for robotic automation in chemistry labs, providing a standardized taxonomy of manipulation skills for improved flexibility and autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chemistry lab robotic systems are limited by task-specific designs and lack a systematic representation of robotics skills, hindering automation and transferability.

Method: The authors created TARMAC, a domain-specific taxonomy, based on teaching-lab demonstrations and experimental validation, categorizing robotic actions by functional roles and physical requirements.

Result: TARMAC systematizes robotic manipulations and allows actions to be composed into macros, enhancing skill reusability and supporting integration into complex workflows.

Conclusion: TARMAC offers a structured and reusable approach to increase flexibility, scalability, and autonomy in chemistry lab automation.

Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
laboratory automation. More information is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-matching methods in robot imitation learning face challenges with high inference times. Alternate solutions like distillation and consistency methods fail to match the original models' performance.

Method: The authors introduce a one-step shortcut method with multi-step integration, extend multi-step consistency loss, split one-step loss into multi-step losses, and propose an adaptive gradient allocation for stable optimization.

Result: Experimental evaluations on two simulation benchmarks and five real-world tasks show improved algorithm performance and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed shortcut method with improved gradient allocation achieves a better balance of inference speed and performance in robot imitation learning.

Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods inadequately handle spatially correlated terrain uncertainties, leading to unreliable robot motion predictions in challenging environments.

Method: Introduces a probabilistic world model incorporating spatially correlated uncertainty and uses a differentiable physics engine for trajectory forecasting, with structured convolutional operators for computational efficiency.

Result: Achievement of enhanced uncertainty estimation and trajectory prediction accuracy, as demonstrated on a public dataset.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses spatial correlation of terrain uncertainties, improving reliability in robot motion prediction for unstructured environments.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream
traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured,
off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual
uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially
independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of
3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we
introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially
correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic
world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics
engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured
convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate
predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a
publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation
and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation
baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simple sampling strategy to address physical action imbalances in multi-task robotic datasets, enhancing generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic datasets are often imbalanced, with many tasks sharing similar physical actions, limiting model effectiveness on low-resource tasks.

Method: The authors propose a sampling strategy that balances physical robotic actions during policy training, requiring minimal modification to existing frameworks.

Result: The sampling method shows significant improvements in generalization, especially for low-resource tasks, without impairing high-resource task performance, validated on simulations and real-world setups.

Conclusion: The simple approach enables better utilization of model capacity for multi-task learning, validated in both training and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by operating underwater robots, particularly Eely, in confined and demanding environmental conditions.

Method: A Bayesian risk assessment method was developed to evaluate the likelihood of losing Eely during specific mission scenarios.

Result: Sensitivity analysis was conducted, identifying key factors impacting the risk of losing Eely.

Conclusion: The study aids in enhancing Eely's performance and increasing mission success rates through risk evaluations.

Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and
intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in
addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated
underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation
of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as
it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme
environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper
proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two
mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and
the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented
in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

Motivation: Large-scale real-world robot data collection for training VLA models is expensive, time-consuming, and limits scalability and generalization.

Method: The approach utilizes world model-generated data (e.g., video generation and sim2real transfer) to improve training efficiency and generalization. RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought supervision are also used for policy robustness and reasoning capabilities.

Result: The model achieves better generalization across appearances, object placements, and camera viewpoints, excelling in complex, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces the need for real-world robot data by using scalable generated data, achieving higher performance and demonstrating a lightweight version for efficient deployment on smaller devices.

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of imitation learning's reliance on expert data by proposing offline reinforcement learning modifications to leverage non-expert data, enhancing robotic policy robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of imitation learning's dependency on task-specific, high-quality data and expand its adaptability to diverse real-world scenarios using lower-cost non-expert data.

Method: The paper utilizes offline reinforcement learning with simple algorithmic modifications to broaden policy distribution support, enabling effective use of non-expert data such as play data and partial demonstrations.

Result: The approach improved recovery and generalization behavior in manipulation tasks, increasing success across diverse initial conditions, even with suboptimal and partial demonstrations.

Conclusion: Incorporating non-expert data with offline RL modifications can significantly enhance the robustness and effectiveness of learned robotics policies, emphasizing the potential for broader data utilization in imitation learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform
complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

*Francesco Schetter,Shifa Sulaiman,Shoby George,Paolino De Risi,Fanny Ficuciello*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study implements Model Predictive Control (MPC) for enhancing soft prosthetic hands, showing improved wrist articulation & natural movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim was to improve adaptability and performance of prosthetic hands by integrating advanced control strategies.

Method: Implemented Model Predictive Control (MPC) with Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange-based kinematic/dynamic modeling, validated via simulation and experiments.

Result: MPC optimized wrist articulation and user control, offering more natural and intuitive movements.

Conclusion: This research advances intelligent prosthetics, improving dexterity and interaction, with significant implications for robotics and biomedical engineering.

Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and
biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent
prosthetic systems.

*Hongyu Ding,Ziming Xu,Yudong Fang,You Wu,Zixuan Chen,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Yifan Zhang,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments is addressed through LaViRA, a modular hierarchical framework, enhancing reasoning, grounding, and practical control for navigation in unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical trade-off in VLN-CE where environmental generalization is limited or reasoning capabilities of large models are underutilized.

Method: LaViRA uses a modular approach with a hierarchy of Language, Vision, and Robot actions to leverage different multimodal large language models effectively.

Result: LaViRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in VLN-CE with excellent generalization capabilities and practical deployment efficiency.

Conclusion: The modular approach of LaViRA provides a transparent and efficient solution for zero-shot navigation in unseen environments, paving the way for robust deployments.

Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language
instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical
trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit
scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large
models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot
framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision
Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This
modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different
scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a
system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.
LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the
VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen
environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world
deployment.

*Vojtěch Vrba,Viktor Walter,Petr Štěpán,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an approach for fast detection of isolated markers in UAV swarms, achieving significant acceleration using three innovations: optimized CPU, GPU shader program, and FPGA architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency and speed of marker detection in agile UAV swarms to support real-time applications, especially for low-end UAVs.

Method: The paper presents three innovations: optimized procedures for CPU, GPU shader programming, and FPGA streaming architecture to speed up marker detection on embedded systems.

Result: The CPU and GPU solutions improved processing speed by 100-1000x over existing methods, while the FPGA solution minimized total delays, making it highly efficient for the real-time localization task.

Conclusion: This approach provides a substantial improvement in marker detection for UAV swarming, making it viable for low-end UAVs and enabling agile swarm technologies.

Abstract: A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for
visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is
introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time
localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an
optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally
equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,
the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.
Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

*Ameesh Shah,William Chen,Adwait Godbole,Federico Mora,Sanjit A. Seshia,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents LITEN, a model integrating reflection capability into Vision-Language-Action models to improve complex robotic control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inability of current Vision-Language-Action models to adjust their strategies dynamically after failing tasks.

Method: The approach involves connecting a low-level VLA policy to a high-level vision-language model that reflects on past experiences and generates refined plans iteratively.

Result: LITEN successfully learns and refines plans using insights from execution, leveraging high-affordance instructions for long-horizon task completion.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that incorporating reflective and iterative capabilities significantly enhances robotic task performance using VLAs.

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we
fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy
accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics,
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving
complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically
readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we
introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA
low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by
including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and
capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning
phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an
assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful
conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar
approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on
unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires
structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate
LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that
use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

### [310] [SEA: Semantic Map Prediction for Active Exploration of Uncertain Areas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19766)
*Hongyu Ding,Xinyue Liang,Yudong Fang,You Wu,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Wenbin Li,Jing Wu,Yu-Kun Lai,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEA, a novel robot exploration framework utilizing semantic map prediction and reinforcement learning policies to enhance efficiency and coverage in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based robot exploration methods lack effective strategies for long-term environmental understanding, leading to inefficient map construction.

Method: The authors present an iterative prediction-exploration framework that predicts missing areas using current observations and improves long-term exploration strategies through reinforcement learning and a reward mechanism.

Result: SEA shows significant performance improvements, achieving higher coverage of global maps compared to state-of-the-art methods under similar time constraints.

Conclusion: Conclusion highlights that SEA enhances active exploration, constructs accurate semantic maps efficiently, and outperforms existing techniques in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration
through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical
exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on
one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term
environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We
propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts
the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference
between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to
guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that
leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration
strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited
steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior
coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.

### [311] [CosmoCore Affective Dream-Replay Reinforcement Learning for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18895)
*Santhosh Kumar Ravindran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CosmoCore, a neuroscience-inspired RL architecture incorporating affective signals to improve code generation in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by how humans and animals learn through emotional responses like embarrassment, which helps foster error correction and efficient learning.

Method: CosmoCore uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to assign valence (emotional weight) and surprise values to code generations. Negative valence instances (e.g., buggy code) are prioritized for replay, while low-surprise correct cases are pruned to avoid inefficiencies.

Result: CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code outputs by 48% and improves self-correction speed by 45% on benchmarks such as HumanEval and BigCodeBench, with validation using Hugging Face models and PySpark.

Conclusion: CosmoCore effectively enhances code generation and self-correction by integrating emotional signals akin to human learning patterns, and it lays groundwork for more emotionally aware AI tools in coding environments.

Abstract: We introduce CosmoCore, a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning (RL)
architecture that integrates affective signals to enhance code generation in
large language models (LLMs). Motivated by human and animal learning where
embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a
puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code
generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as
buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay
during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent
overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like
HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline
environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or
logical bugs) by 48\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\%. Local
experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these
gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence
tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and pruning mitigates inefficiency.
This framework extends RL from human feedback (RLHF) for more emotionally aware
code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines. Code and the
custom mini-world simulation are released.

*Eduard Frankford,Tobias Antensteiner,Michael Vierhauser,Clemens Sauerwein,Vivien Wallner,Iris Groher,Reinhold Plösch,Ruth Breu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores feedback mechanisms in programming education, highlighting that AI-generated feedback significantly improves student performance compared to unit tests and compiler feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing demand for programming education resulting from widespread digitization and the diverse student backgrounds in modern curricula.

Method: A comparative study was conducted with over 200 students from two universities, evaluating compiler feedback, unit test feedback, and advanced LLM-based feedback.

Result: Students perceive unit tests as the most helpful feedback mechanism, but AI-generated feedback leads to significantly improved performance.

Conclusion: Combining unit tests with AI-driven feedback can optimize automated programming assessment systems and enhance learning outcomes.

Abstract: With the recent rapid increase in digitization across all major industries,
acquiring programming skills has increased the demand for introductory
programming courses. This has further resulted in universities integrating
programming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only
technical studies but also business and management fields of study.
  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and
tutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of
this, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing
scalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and
instant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for
generating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback
that can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can
enhance feedback quality and personalization.
  To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by
students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have
conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different
universities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard
Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality
and impact on student performance.
  Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most
helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.
These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize
automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming
education.

### [313] [Extending Resource Constrained Project Scheduling to Mega-Projects with Model-Based Systems Engineering & Hetero-functional Graph Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19035)
*Amirreza Hosseini,Amro M. Farid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper integrates resource-constrained project scheduling (RCPSP) with model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT) for better project modeling and management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCPSP is central to project management but lacks integration with broader model-based systems engineering (MBSE), limiting its usefulness in complex system design and management.

Method: The authors translate activity-on-node networks to SysML activity diagrams and operand nets. They use hetero-functional graph theory to align RCPSP with minimum-cost flow formulations for enhanced quantitative analysis.

Result: The specialized HFNMCF approach produces equivalent schedules to classical RCPSP while facilitating deeper monitoring, control, and explicit project state explanations.

Conclusion: The framework retains classical RCPSP's strengths while addressing real-world constraints and aiding enterprise-level decisions in large, complex projects.

Abstract: Within the project management context, project scheduling serves as an
indispensable component, functioning as a fundamental tool for planning,
monitoring, controlling, and managing projects more broadly. Although the
resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of
project management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader
literature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its
integration into the design and management of complex systems. The original
contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the
RCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems
engineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation
pipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then
to an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the
hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP
context as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that
the RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an
illustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the
specialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit
explanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.
Overall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while
accommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes
encountered in large, complex megaprojects.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study investigates the readability of bitwise operators, identifying factors like response time and error rate affected by operator type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how users with diverse programming backgrounds understand bitwise operators and determine if operator complexity impacts performance metrics.

Method: A within-subject experimental design was conducted with 23 participants performing JavaScript tasks, measuring response time and accuracy.

Result: Task completion times are significantly affected by certain operators, such as OR, NOT, and Left Shift, although the overall complexity of operators did not universally extend completion times.

Conclusion: Some bitwise operators are less intuitive, warranting additional research and redesign for better clarity and usability.

Abstract: Objectives: This study aims to investigate the readability and
understandability of bitwise operators in programming, with the main hypothesis
that there will be a difference in the performance metrics (response time and
error rate) between participants exposed to various bitwise operators related
questions and those who are not.
  Participants: Participants in this human research study include people
without programming background, novice programmers, and university students
with varying programming experience (from freshmen to PhD level). There were 23
participants for this study.
  Study Methods: This study uses an Within-Subjects Experimental Design to
assess how people with diverse programming backgrounds understand and use
bitwise operators. Participants complete tasks in JavaScript program, and their
task completion time and accuracy of the tasks are recorded for analysis.
  Findings: The results indicate that operators can be one of the factors
predicting response time, with a small but significant effect, with R-squared
0.032, (1, 494) = 16.5, p < .001. Additionally, some operators like OR, NOT,
and Left Shift showed statistical significance in task completion times
compared to other operators.
  Conclusions: While the complexity of bitwise operators did not generally
result in longer task completion times, certain operators were found to be less
intuitive, suggesting the need for further investigation and potential redesign
for improved understandability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReqEBench, a benchmark to assess automated CPSs requirements concern extraction solutions, offering real-world applicability and comprehensive analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of fair and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating automated CPSs requirements concern extraction solutions.

Method: The authors propose ReqEBench, a benchmark that includes 2,721 CPSs requirements from 12 real-world systems, and rigorously aligns with real-world dimensions, undergoes detailed annotation, and encompasses multiple application domains.

Result: Their study, using ReqEBench, evaluated three automated solutions, revealing the highest F1 score of just 0.24 for GPT-4 in entity concern extraction and identifying limitations in current solutions.

Conclusion: ReqEBench is positioned as a valuable tool for advancing the evaluation and development of CPSs requirements concern extraction solutions, with suggestions for improvement in current methods.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by a deep integration of the
information space and the physical world, which makes the extraction of
requirements concerns more challenging. Some automated solutions for
requirements concern extraction have been proposed to alleviate the burden on
requirements engineers. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these
solutions, which relies on fair and comprehensive benchmarks, remains an open
question. To address this gap, we propose ReqEBench, a new CPSs requirements
concern extraction benchmark, which contains 2,721 requirements from 12
real-world CPSs. ReqEBench offers four advantages. It aligns with real-world
CPSs requirements in multiple dimensions, e.g., scale and complexity. It covers
comprehensive concerns related to CPSs requirements. It undergoes a rigorous
annotation process. It covers multiple application domains of CPSs, e.g.,
aerospace and healthcare. We conducted a comparative study on three types of
automated requirements concern extraction solutions and revealed their
performance in real-world CPSs using our ReqEBench. We found that the highest
F1 score of GPT-4 is only 0.24 in entity concern extraction. We further analyze
failure cases of popular LLM-based solutions, summarize their shortcomings, and
provide ideas for improving their capabilities. We believe ReqEBench will
facilitate the evaluation and development of automated requirements concern
extraction.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture ensures reliable and reproducible development cycles for Linux-based operating systems in embedded systems. It offers scalability for industrial and research applications, with future expansions recommended for automated testing, monitoring, and distributed builds.

Abstract: With the growing use of embedded systems in various industries, the need for
automated platforms for the development and deployment of customized
Linux-based operating systems has become more important. This research was
conducted with the aim of designing and implementing an integrated and
reproducible infrastructure for the development, building, and testing of a
Linux-based operating system using the Yocto Project. The proposed structure
was implemented based on a three-layer architecture consisting of the main
Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest
layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility.
Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel
module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented
with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and
streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server
containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build
time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six
boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed
design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced
applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future
recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system
monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing
with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time
Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and
research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development
cycle.

*Chong Chen,Jiachi Chen,Lingfeng Bao,David Lo,Yanlin Wang,Zhenyu Shan,Ting Chen,Guangqiang Yin,Jianxing Yu,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a new tool, TRACE, to tackle Access Control vulnerabilities in non-compilable smart contract repositories using LLM techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security risks in smart contract repositories, particularly vulnerabilities caused by improper Access Control, which have led to massive financial losses.

Method: TRACE uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify, complete, and analyze sensitive functions in smart contracts. It employs abstract syntax trees (AST) and control flow graphs (CFG) to detect vulnerabilities.

Result: Experimental evaluations show TRACE significantly outperformed existing tools on CVE datasets and recent on-chain contracts, with 89.2% precision. On real-world repositories, it achieved 87.0% precision, far exceeding competitors.

Conclusion: TRACE is an effective and innovative tool for detecting Access Control vulnerabilities in non-compilable smart contract repositories, offering substantial improvements over current solutions.

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities, particularly improper Access Control that
allows unauthorized execution of restricted functions, have caused billions of
dollars in losses. GitHub hosts numerous smart contract repositories containing
source code, documentation, and configuration files-these serve as intermediate
development artifacts that must be compiled and packaged before deployment.
Third-party developers often reference, reuse, or fork code from these
repositories during custom development. However, if the referenced code
contains vulnerabilities, it can introduce significant security risks. Existing
tools for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities are limited in their ability
to handle complex repositories, as they typically require the target contract
to be compilable to generate an abstract representation for further analysis.
This paper presents TRACE, a tool designed to secure non-compilable smart
contract repositories against access control vulnerabilities. TRACE employs
LLMs to locate sensitive functions involving critical operations (e.g.,
transfer) within the contract and subsequently completes function snippets into
a fully compilable contract. TRACE constructs a function call graph from the
abstract syntax tree (AST) of the completed contract. It uses the control flow
graph (CFG) of each function as node information. The nodes of the sensitive
functions are then analyzed to detect Access Control vulnerabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE outperforms state-of-the-art tools
on an open-sourced CVE dataset, detecting 14 out of 15 CVEs. In addition, it
achieves 89.2% precision on 5,000 recent on-chain contracts, far exceeding the
best existing tool at 76.9%. On 83 real-world repositories, TRACE achieves
87.0% precision, significantly surpassing DeepSeek-R1's 14.3%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance automation in API-first development of RESTful web services and explore the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems in this domain.

Method: The method involves creating OpenAPI specifications, generating server code, and applying a feedback loop using execution logs and error messages to improve the code.

Result: Using the PRAB benchmark, the study found that focused OpenAPI specifications allow LLMs to produce complete functional code with business logic aligning to the specifications.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively automate API-first development of RESTful services when specifications are kept focused and small, with improved results facilitated by log analysis in a multi-agent setting.

Abstract: This paper presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs)-based
agents to automate the API-first development of RESTful microservices. This
system helps to create an OpenAPI specification, generate server code from it,
and refine the code through a feedback loop that analyzes execution logs and
error messages. The integration of log analysis enables the LLM to detect and
address issues efficiently, reducing the number of iterations required to
produce functional and robust services. This study's main goal is to advance
API-first development automation for RESTful web services and test the
capability of LLM-based multi-agent systems in supporting the API-first
development approach. To test the proposed system's potential, we utilized the
PRAB benchmark. The results indicate that if we keep the OpenAPI specification
small and focused, LLMs are capable of generating complete functional code with
business logic that aligns to the specification. The code for the system is
publicly available at https://github.com/sirbh/code-gen

*Stefan Schott,Serena Elisa Ponta,Wolfram Fischer,Jonas Klauke,Eric Bodden*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Jaralyzer is a Java dependency scanner that analyzes bytecode to detect vulnerabilities, surpassing other scanners in accuracy and handling dependency modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to heavy reliance on open-source dependencies in Java projects, there is a security risk of introducing vulnerabilities, which existing scanners struggle to detect fully when dependencies are modified.

Method: Jaralyzer analyzes the bytecode of dependencies directly, bypassing the need for metadata or source code.

Result: Jaralyzer detects vulnerabilities more effectively than existing tools, identifying 28 more true vulnerabilities and reducing false warnings by 29 when compared to Eclipse Steady.

Conclusion: Jaralyzer is the most effective scanner for detecting vulnerabilities in both modified and unmodified OSS dependencies, addressing major challenges in dependency scanning.

Abstract: On average, 71% of the code in typical Java projects comes from open-source
software (OSS) dependencies, making OSS dependencies the dominant component of
modern software code bases. This high degree of OSS reliance comes with a
considerable security risk of adding known security vulnerabilities to a code
base. To remedy this risk, researchers and companies have developed various
dependency scanners, which try to identify inclusions of known-to-be-vulnerable
OSS dependencies. However, there are still challenges that modern dependency
scanners do not overcome, especially when it comes to dependency modifications,
such as re-compilations, re-bundlings or re-packagings, which are common in the
Java ecosystem. To overcome these challenges, we present Jaralyzer, a
bytecode-centric dependency scanner for Java. Jaralyzer does not rely on the
metadata or the source code of the included OSS dependencies being available
but directly analyzes a dependency's bytecode. Our evaluation across 56 popular
OSS components demonstrates that Jaralyzer outperforms other popular dependency
scanners in detecting vulnerabilities within modified dependencies. It is the
only scanner capable of identifying vulnerabilities across all the above
mentioned types of modifications. But even when applied to unmodified
dependencies, Jaralyzer outperforms the current state-of-the-art code-centric
scanner Eclipse Steady by detecting 28 more true vulnerabilities and yielding
29 fewer false warnings.

### [321] [AutoMT: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Automated Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19438)
*Linfeng Liang,Chenkai Tan,Yao Deng,Yingfeng Cai,T. Y Chen,Xi Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoMT proposes an automated Metamorphic Testing framework using Large Language Models for Autonomous Driving Systems to detect faults more effectively, outperforming traditional manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous Driving Systems require robust fault detection methods due to their safety-critical nature, but manual Metamorphic Testing lacks efficiency and automation.

Method: AutoMT leverages Large Language Models to autonomously extract Metamorphic Relations from traffic rules, analyze test scenarios, and generate follow-up test cases using predefined ontologies, a search agent, and computer vision.

Result: Experiments show AutoMT generates test cases with 5x higher diversity and detects up to 20.55% more behavioral violations compared to manual methods.

Conclusion: AutoMT enhances Metamorphic Testing for ADS by introducing automation in MR extraction and test generation, improving detection of critical corner cases and supporting industrial integration possibilities.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are safety-critical, where failures can be
severe. While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS,
existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present
AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that
automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic
rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs
to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined
ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent
retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases
via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher
test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline
(manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to
20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of
predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations
that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed
during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture
separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration
into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to
systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.

*Thomas I. Strasser,Edmund Widl,Carlos Ayon Mac Gregor,Mirko Ginocchi,Rene Kuchenbuch*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for enhanced interoperability testing in Europe's evolving energy systems and proposes a structured analysis of 30 facilities to improve such testing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high interoperability is crucial to support the transformation of Europe’s energy landscape into a secure, flexible, and efficient infrastructure driven by renewables, digital tech, and decentralization.

Method: Analyzed 30 European interoperability testing facilities through a structured survey, categorizing their infrastructures, methodologies, and reference test cases.

Result: The study identified gaps in interoperability testing and provided a blueprint for future testing environments. It fosters a coordinated European system for enhanced collaboration and innovation.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to creating a harmonized European ecosystem for interoperability testing facilities to align with energy transition objectives.

Abstract: The ongoing transformation of the European energy landscape, driven by the
integration of renewable energy sources, digital technologies, and
decentralized systems, requires a high degree of interoperability across
diverse components and systems. Ensuring that these elements can exchange
information and operate together reliably is essential for achieving a secure,
flexible, and efficient energy supply infrastructure. While several initiatives
have contributed to the development of smart grid testing infrastructures, they
do not provide a dedicated or comprehensive focus on interoperability testing.
A structured and harmonized overview of interoperability testing capabilities
across Europe is therefore still missing. This work therefore presents a novel
contribution by analyzing the European interoperability testing facility
landscape through a structured survey of 30 facilities. It provides a
categorized inventory of testing infrastructures, applied methodologies, and
reference test cases, and introduces a blueprint for the development of future
testing environments. The findings contribute to the establishment of a
coordinated European ecosystem for interoperability testing, supporting
collaboration, innovation, and alignment with the goals of the energy
transition.

### [323] [A Goal-Driven Survey on Root Cause Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19593)
*Aoyang Fang,Haowen Yang,Haoze Dong,Qisheng Lu,Junjielong Xu,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes a goal-driven framework for categorizing root cause analysis (RCA) papers in cloud incident management, addressing diverse goals among 135 studies from 2014-2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RCA surveys neglect goal-based distinctions, focusing on input types and group diverse objectives together, requiring a framework that highlights progress and gaps.

Method: A goal-driven framework is introduced to reorganize RCA papers by their objectives and discuss overarching goals, open challenges, and future directions.

Result: 135 RCA papers are categorized based on their objectives, offering clarity in research, progress, and gaps.

Conclusion: Goal-driven organization of RCA research aligns better with audience needs and identifies key challenges and avenues for future research.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a crucial aspect of incident management in
large-scale cloud services. While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been
widely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because
the term "RCA" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For
instance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is
fundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a
definitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these
goal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types
(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of
works with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps
in the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen
who want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who
want to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA
survey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high
demand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that
effectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of
cloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period
from 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses
the ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA
formulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future
directions in RCA.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPage, a multi-agent system that automates the creation of interactive project webpages from research papers. It employs a hierarchical process to ensure accuracy, quality, and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers often struggle with creating accessible, interactive webpages for their dense papers, a repetitive and time-consuming task. The paper aims to simplify and optimize this process.

Method: AutoPage uses a hierarchical, multi-agent pipeline for creating webpages. Steps include narrative planning, multimodal content generation, interactive rendering, and accuracy checks by agents. Human checkpoints are optionally used to align results with authors' vision.

Result: AutoPage demonstrated efficiency by creating high-quality webpages within 15 minutes at a cost below $0.1. PageBench was introduced as a benchmark for validation.

Conclusion: AutoPage significantly streamlines the webpage creation process for researchers, blending automation, collaboration, and validation to produce sophisticated outputs efficiently. Code and dataset are made publicly available.

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency
in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at
$\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

*Zhiping Zhou,Xiaohong Li,Ruitao Feng,Yao Zhang,Yuekang Li,Wenbu Feng,Yunqian Wang,Yuqing Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FidelityGPT is a framework designed to enhance the accuracy and readability of decompiled code, particularly for complex closed-source binaries, by detecting and correcting semantic distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fidelity issues in decompilation, which degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled code and hinder effective analysis and debugging.

Method: The proposed FidelityGPT framework uses distortion-aware prompt templates, combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to identify and correct semantic distortions, and employs a variable dependency algorithm to manage long-context problems in closed-source binaries.

Result: FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89%, a precision of 83%, a fix rate (FR) of 94%, and a corrected fix rate (CFR) of 64%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art DeGPT.

Conclusion: FidelityGPT demonstrates significant improvements in the decompiled output's accuracy and readability, making it highly promising for applications in LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering tasks.

Abstract: Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling
analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often
degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing
methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide
partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for
complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that
enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting
and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware
prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity
algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from
a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context
limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies
into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary
similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89%
and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%,
Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating
significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its
potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.

TL;DR: This paper explores agentic AI's transformative effects on software engineering, advocating for broader inclusion of socio-technical concerns and proposing principles for the emerging agentic SE field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to guide the establishment and evolution of agentic SE by addressing shortcomings and widening its scope beyond code-centric activities.

Method: The authors recommend expanding agentic SE to encompass 'whole of process' considerations, propose values and principles for the field, and offer design guidance for a shared vocabulary.

Result: The paper contributes actionable ideas, including frameworks, principles, and terminology guidance to support community development in agentic SE.

Conclusion: Agentic SE should be developed in a holistic, deliberate, and desirable manner by addressing broader socio-technical concerns and fostering community collaboration.

Abstract: Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software
Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a
reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area.
While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related
activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of
socio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to
the emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope
beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations
and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary
set of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on
designing/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these
ideas will encourage community collaborations and steer the SE community
towards laying strong foundations of agentic SE so its not only inevitable but
also deliberate and desirable in the long run.

*Priyaranjan Pattnayak,Hussain Bohra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper surveys zero code platforms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), categorizes them, analyzes their capabilities, and discusses challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how LLMs are transforming software development by enabling non-programmers to create applications without writing code, using accessible no-code and low-code platforms.

Method: The authors conducted a broad survey, categorizing platforms based on interface style, backend integration, output type, and extensibility, while analyzing their strengths, limitations, and trade-offs compared to traditional approaches.

Result: The survey creates a taxonomy of LLM-based zero code platforms, compares their features and capabilities, and identifies challenges related to flexibility, reliability, customizability, scalability, and vendor lock-in.

Conclusion: LLM-based zero code platforms significantly lower barriers to software creation for non-programmers, but improvements are needed in areas such as flexibility and reliability. The field has exciting opportunities for further democratization of app development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling
zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let
users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains
of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing
platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration,
output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app
builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and
general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM
capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their
interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type
(chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core
features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration,
and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed
comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs
(customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with
traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future
directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved
orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate
that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI
powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and
reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting
opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.

*S M Sadrul Islam Asif,James Chen,Earl T. Barr,Mark Marron*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BOSQTGEN, an API test generation tool that achieves high code coverage using a black-box method and combinatorial techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust conformance testing arises due to inadequate API contracts causing failures and mismatched expectations.

Method: BOSQTGEN decomposes API specifications into primitives using LLMs, suggests coherent strata, and applies combinatorial testing for efficient sampling.

Result: BOSQTGEN achieves an average of 82% code coverage on RESTful benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by 20% or more and nearing hand-crafted test suites.

Conclusion: BOSQTGEN offers an automated, high-quality testing framework for APIs, streamlining test creation and ensuring critical interaction coverage.

Abstract: Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API
contract to a critical role. Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched
expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance
testing. Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges:
polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off,
and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.
  We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test
generation. BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API
specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them,
and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values.
This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the
redundancy of random sampling.
  The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on
RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art
systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites. Providing a fully
API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically
create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.

### [329] [Calibrated Principal Component Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19020)
*Yixuan Florence Wu,Yilun Zhu,Lei Cao and,Naichen Shi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Calibrated Principal Component Regression (CPCR) to reduce variance and bias in generalized linear models under overparameterized conditions, enhancing prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Principal Component Regression (PCR) methods in high-dimensional settings reduce variance but suffer from truncation bias when the true regression vector falls outside retained principal components.

Method: CPCR combines the low-variance estimation from PCR in a principal component subspace with a calibration step in the original feature space using a centered Tikhonov approach, leveraging cross-fitting to control truncation bias.

Result: CPCR achieves lower out-of-sample risk compared to traditional PCR in scenarios where regression signals exist in low-variance directions, consistently improving prediction performance across empirical tests.

Conclusion: CPCR offers a robust solution for modern overparameterized problems, balancing bias and variance to achieve stable and flexible statistical inference.

Abstract: We propose a new method for statistical inference in generalized linear
models. In the overparameterized regime, Principal Component Regression (PCR)
reduces variance by projecting high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional
principal subspace before fitting. However, PCR incurs truncation bias whenever
the true regression vector has mass outside the retained principal components
(PC). To mitigate the bias, we propose Calibrated Principal Component
Regression (CPCR), which first learns a low-variance prior in the PC subspace
and then calibrates the model in the original feature space via a centered
Tikhonov step. CPCR leverages cross-fitting and controls the truncation bias by
softening PCR's hard cutoff. Theoretically, we calculate the out-of-sample risk
in the random matrix regime, which shows that CPCR outperforms standard PCR
when the regression signal has non-negligible components in low-variance
directions. Empirically, CPCR consistently improves prediction across multiple
overparameterized problems. The results highlight CPCR's stability and
flexibility in modern overparameterized settings.

### [330] [Signature Kernel Scoring Rule as Spatio-Temporal Diagnostic for Probabilistic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19110)
*Archer Dodson,Ritabrata Dutta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the signature kernel scoring rule to improve probabilistic weather forecasting methods, using rough path theory to account for temporal and spatial dependencies in weather data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weather forecasting techniques face limitations using conventional scoring rules like MSE, which do not adequately account for the correlated data structures inherent in meteorological systems.

Method: The authors employ the signature kernel scoring rule derived from rough path theory, which treats weather variables as continuous paths. This technique captures temporal and spatial dependencies through iterated integrals and ensures proper scoring through path augmentations.

Result: Empirical evaluations, including training generative neural networks on ERA5 reanalysis data, show that models trained with the signature kernel scoring rule outperform climatology forecasts across multiple timesteps.

Conclusion: The signature kernel scoring rule is a theoretically sound and practically effective metric for weather forecast model training and evaluation, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex path-dependent interactions.

Abstract: Modern weather forecasting has increasingly transitioned from numerical
weather prediction (NWP) to data-driven machine learning forecasting
techniques. While these new models produce probabilistic forecasts to quantify
uncertainty, their training and evaluation may remain hindered by conventional
scoring rules, primarily MSE, which ignore the highly correlated data
structures present in weather and atmospheric systems. This work introduces the
signature kernel scoring rule, grounded in rough path theory, which reframes
weather variables as continuous paths to encode temporal and spatial
dependencies through iterated integrals. Validated as strictly proper through
the use of path augmentations to guarantee uniqueness, the signature kernel
provides a theoretically robust metric for forecast verification and model
training. Empirical evaluations through weather scorecards on WeatherBench 2
models demonstrate the signature kernel scoring rule's high discriminative
power and unique capacity to capture path-dependent interactions. Following
previous demonstration of successful adversarial-free probabilistic training,
we train sliding window generative neural networks using a
predictive-sequential scoring rule on ERA5 reanalysis weather data. Using a
lightweight model, we demonstrate that signature kernel based training
outperforms climatology for forecast paths of up to fifteen timesteps.

### [331] [Extreme Event Aware ($η$-) Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19161)
*Kai Chang,Themistoklis P. Sapsis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Introducing $eta$-learning, a method for quantifying and predicting extreme events even in datasets lacking such events, leveraging statistical regularization for enhanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in predicting rare and extreme events due to their infrequency and the associated high computational costs.

Method: Developing $eta$-learning which leverages statistical regularization for training, using observable statistics indicative of extremeness, even in datasets lacking extreme events.

Result: $eta$-learning reduces uncertainty in extreme event regions and produces accurate models consistent with prescribed observable statistics, supported by theoretical results and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: $eta$-learning enables robust prediction and generation of extreme events by overcoming the limitation of requiring extreme events in the training data, paving a pathway for improved models in regions of high uncertainty.

Abstract: Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet
challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical
challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including
the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial
computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven
methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a
typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of
multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the
sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events
but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or
$\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the
available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'
extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an
observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available
through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of
statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while
enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the
generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack
extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a
rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.
Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable
properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and
real-world precipitation downscaling problems.

*Pattravadee de Favereau de Jeneret,Ioannis Diamantis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) versus traditional statistical methods in clustering foreign exchange (FX) market behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity, non-linear, and high-dimensional dynamics of the FX market challenge traditional clustering techniques. TDA is explored as an alternative method to enhance analysis.

Method: The FX market data (13 major currency exchange rates) was analyzed using monthly logarithmic returns. TDA-derived features and classical statistical features were clustered using k-means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms, evaluated with Silhouette scores and the Calinski-Harabasz index.

Result: TDA-based feature clustering achieved more compact and distinct clusters, reflected in higher Calinski-Harabasz scores, but modest Silhouette scores were observed across all methods.

Conclusion: TDA demonstrates potential as a supplementary tool for analyzing FX market behaviors, capturing structural currency co-movements that traditional methods may miss, valuable for risk management applications.

Abstract: This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide
additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering
currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a
complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that
classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based
on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly
logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro).
Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering,
are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the
Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that
TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters
than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving
substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering
approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty
of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs.
classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency
co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight
TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with
potential applications in risk management where understanding structural
co-movements is crucial.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating legal document analysis, especially in extracting metadata and identifying legal clauses efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of large language models, there is an increasing need to optimize tasks like contract review, where identifying legal clauses plays a vital role in legal document automation.

Method: Using the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) and proprietary datasets, the authors employ LLM techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, structured tool calling, text conversion, and chunking strategies.

Result: The proposed techniques significantly improve accuracy and efficiency in identifying legal clauses, effectively reducing review time and costs.

Conclusion: Optimized LLM systems show great potential for aiding legal professionals and enhancing accessibility to contract review services for various organizations.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models has revolutionized tasks across domains,
including the automation of legal document analysis, a critical component of
modern contract management systems. This paper presents a comprehensive
implementation of LLM-enhanced metadata extraction for contract review,
focusing on the automatic detection and annotation of salient legal clauses.
Leveraging both the publicly available Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset
(CUAD) and proprietary contract datasets, our work demonstrates the integration
of advanced LLM methodologies with practical applications. We identify three
pivotal elements for optimizing metadata extraction: robust text conversion,
strategic chunk selection, and advanced LLM-specific techniques, including
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and structured tool calling. The results from
our experiments highlight the substantial improvements in clause identification
accuracy and efficiency. Our approach shows promise in reducing the time and
cost associated with contract review while maintaining high accuracy in legal
clause identification. The results suggest that carefully optimized LLM systems
could serve as valuable tools for legal professionals, potentially increasing
access to efficient contract review services for organizations of all sizes.

*Corentin Pla,Hugo Richard,Marc Abeille,Nadav Merlis,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores reinforcement learning with transition look-ahead, demonstrating that while it can enhance performance, the computational complexity increases significantly as look-ahead depth grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how predictive information about future states impacts reinforcement learning performance and computational complexity.

Method: Analyzed RL with transition look-ahead using both theoretical proofs and a novel linear programming formulation to determine computational feasibility.

Result: Found that optimal planning with one-step look-ahead is computationally efficient, but for deeper look-ahead ($\ell \geq 2$), the problem becomes NP-hard.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a clear boundary between computational tractability and intractability in planning with transition look-ahead, offering both theoretical understanding and practical implications.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with transition look-ahead, where the
agent may observe which states would be visited upon playing any sequence of
$\ell$ actions before deciding its course of action. While such predictive
information can drastically improve the achievable performance, we show that
using this information optimally comes at a potentially prohibitive
computational cost. Specifically, we prove that optimal planning with one-step
look-ahead ($\ell=1$) can be solved in polynomial time through a novel linear
programming formulation. In contrast, for $\ell \geq 2$, the problem becomes
NP-hard. Our results delineate a precise boundary between tractable and
intractable cases for the problem of planning with transition look-ahead in
reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposed a penalty parameter $lambda$ tuned through square root adjustments in Cox’s partial likelihood, with asymptotically pivotal properties.

Result: Improves feature selection by achieving a phase transition probability of correctly identifying good features, extending applications to both linear models and neural networks.

Conclusion: The methodology significantly advances feature selection performance over traditional approaches and has versatile applicability.

Abstract: We revisit Cox's proportional hazard models and LASSO in the aim of improving
feature selection in survival analysis. Unlike traditional methods relying on
cross-validation or BIC, the penalty parameter $\lambda$ is directly tuned for
feature selection and is asymptotically pivotal thanks to taking the square
root of Cox's partial likelihood. Substantially improving over both
cross-validation LASSO and BIC subset selection, our approach has a phase
transition on the probability of retrieving all and only the good features,
like in compressed sensing. The method can be employed by linear models but
also by artificial neural networks.

### [336] [A Derandomization Framework for Structure Discovery: Applications in Neural Networks and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19382)
*Nikos Tsikouras,Yorgos Pantis,Ioannis Mitliagkas,Christos Tzamos*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies feature learning dynamics in neural networks, focusing on structural discovery under weaker assumptions and its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding feature learning dynamics in neural networks is crucial, as low-rank structures in NN weights reduce sample complexity and improve generalization.

Method: The study focuses on a derandomization lemma to explain structural properties in neural networks, allowing for general settings like arbitrary size, smooth loss, tiny regularization, and SOSP-trained methods.

Result: Key result is the derandomization lemma, showing weight matrix convergence to zero under mild conditions, facilitating structure discovery and applications.

Conclusion: The work advances theoretical understanding of NN feature dynamics and structure discovery, with applications in optimization and embedding problems.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of feature learning in neural networks (NNs)
remains a significant challenge. The work of (Mousavi-Hosseini et al., 2023)
analyzes a multiple index teacher-student setting and shows that a two-layer
student attains a low-rank structure in its first-layer weights when trained
with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and a strong regularizer. This
structural property is known to reduce sample complexity of generalization.
Indeed, in a second step, the same authors establish algorithm-specific
learning guarantees under additional assumptions. In this paper, we focus
exclusively on the structure discovery aspect and study it under weaker
assumptions, more specifically: we allow (a) NNs of arbitrary size and depth,
(b) with all parameters trainable, (c) under any smooth loss function, (d) tiny
regularization, and (e) trained by any method that attains a second-order
stationary point (SOSP), e.g.\ perturbed gradient descent (PGD). At the core of
our approach is a key $\textit{derandomization}$ lemma, which states that
optimizing the function $\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}}
\left[g_{\theta}(\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b})\right]$ converges to a
point where $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{0}$, under mild conditions. The fundamental
nature of this lemma directly explains structure discovery and has immediate
applications in other domains including an end-to-end approximation for MAXCUT,
and computing Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings.

*Sebastian Reboul,Hélène Halconruy,Randal Douc*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to utilize offline data to enhance online reinforcement learning through learning value envelopes, resulting in significant improvements over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical grounding and underexplored potential of using offline data to accelerate online reinforcement learning.

Method: A two-stage approach is proposed: first, offline data derives upper and lower bounds on value functions; second, these bounds are incorporated into online reinforcement learning algorithms, with the bounds modeled as random variables and ensuring independence across phases.

Result: The analysis reveals high-probability regret bounds tied to meaningful quantities, and experiments on tabular MDPs show the method's efficiency, exhibiting notable reductions in regret compared to other baselines like UCBVI.

Conclusion: The framework creates a robust connection between offline pre-training and online fine-tuning, demonstrating both theoretical and empirical advantages in reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental problem of leveraging offline data to
accelerate online reinforcement learning - a direction with strong potential
but limited theoretical grounding. Our study centers on how to learn and apply
value envelopes within this context. To this end, we introduce a principled
two-stage framework: the first stage uses offline data to derive upper and
lower bounds on value functions, while the second incorporates these learned
bounds into online algorithms. Our method extends prior work by decoupling the
upper and lower bounds, enabling more flexible and tighter approximations. In
contrast to approaches that rely on fixed shaping functions, our envelopes are
data-driven and explicitly modeled as random variables, with a filtration
argument ensuring independence across phases. The analysis establishes
high-probability regret bounds determined by two interpretable quantities,
thereby providing a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online
fine-tuning. Empirical results on tabular MDPs demonstrate substantial regret
reductions compared with both UCBVI and prior methods.

Motivation: To address the challenges posed by uncertainties in sensor locations which impact sensing performance and optimize coverage in directional sensor networks.

Method: The authors propose a distributed greedy algorithm and present an exact formula for the radius of robust feasibility. Sensors are oriented strategically in high potential regions under uncertain conditions.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates high adaptability, efficiency, and robustness in dynamic environments, optimizing sensor orientations and maximizing coverage.

Conclusion: The model proves effective and practical in addressing real-world challenges in sensor coverage and orientation under uncertainty.

Abstract: A sensor has the ability to probe its surroundings. However, uncertainties in
its exact location can significantly compromise its sensing performance. The
radius of robust feasibility defines the maximum range within which robust
feasibility is ensured. This work introduces a novel approach integrating it
with the directional sensor networks to enhance coverage using a distributed
greedy algorithm. In particular, we provide an exact formula for the radius of
robust feasibility of sensors in a directional sensor network. The proposed
model strategically orients the sensors in regions with high coverage
potential, accounting for robustness in the face of uncertainty. We analyze the
algorithm's adaptability in dynamic environments, demonstrating its ability to
enhance efficiency and robustness. Experimental results validate its efficacy
in maximizing coverage and optimizing sensor orientations, highlighting its
practical advantages for real-world scenarios.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a nonmonotone descent method for nonsmooth, nonconvex upper-$\mathcal{C}^2$ functions, proposing the Self-adaptive Nonmonotone Subgradient Method (SNSM) and demonstrating its effectiveness through numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonmonotone descent methods for nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problems required tools to adapt and converge effectively. This paper aims to extend these methods to functions categorized as upper-$\mathcal{C}^2$.

Method: A general subgradient algorithm is developed with a nonmonotone linesearch approach, proving subsequential convergence to stationary points. A specific method (SNSM) is introduced, which adjusts linesearch parameters automatically.

Result: The authors provide a computational implementation of SNSM, particularly for the sum-of-squares clustering problem, showcasing superior performance compared to prior algorithms.

Conclusion: SNSM extends subgradient optimization methods, demonstrating significant advantages in numerical experiments, especially for nonsmooth, nonconvex problems.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the context of nonmonotone descent methods
to the class of nonsmooth and nonconvex functions called upper-$\mathcal{C}^2$,
which satisfy a nonsmooth and local version of the descent lemma. Under this
assumption, we propose a general subgradient method that performs a nonmonotone
linesearch, and we prove subsequential convergence to a stationary point of the
optimization problem. Our approach allows us to cover the setting of various
subgradient algorithms, including Newton and quasi-Newton methods. In addition,
we propose a specification of the general scheme, named Self-adaptive
Nonmonotone Subgradient Method (SNSM), which automatically updates the
parameters of the linesearch. Particular attention is paid to the minimum
sum-of-squares clustering problem, for which we provide a concrete
implementation of SNSM. We conclude with some numerical experiments where we
exhibit the advantages of SNSM in comparison with some known algorithms.

Motivation: Despite advancements, there is a significant delay (on average 17 years) in translating AI developments in MI into clinical practice.

Method: The authors propose implementation science (IS) as a framework to bridge the gap, emphasizing systematic frameworks, hybrid research designs, effectiveness research, stakeholder engagement, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

Result: Key challenges such as infrastructural, educational, and cultural barriers are identified, and the complementary roles of research methodologies are highlighted.

Conclusion: Adopting IS can strategically accelerate the adoption of AI in MI, enabling faster translation into improved patient care and outcomes.

Abstract: The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical
Imaging (MI) is well recognized. Yet despite promising reports in research
settings, many AI tools fail to achieve clinical adoption in practice. In fact,
more generally, there is a documented 17-year average delay between evidence
generation and implementation of a technology1. Implementation science (IS) may
provide a practical, evidence-based framework to bridge the gap between AI
development and real-world clinical imaging use that helps shorten this lag
through systematic frameworks, strategies, and hybrid research designs. We
outline challenges specific to AI adoption in MI workflows, including
infrastructural, educational, and cultural barriers. We highlight the
complementary roles of effectiveness research and implementation research,
emphasizing hybrid study designs and the role of integrated KT (iKT),
stakeholder engagement, and equity-focused co-creation in designing sustainable
and generalizable solutions. We discuss integration of Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI) frameworks in MI towards usable AI. Adopting IS is not only a
methodological advancement; it is a strategic imperative for accelerating

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores local guidance to improve multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) efficiency and introduces a new approach with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multi-agent pathfinding efficiency by addressing global congestion via local guidance, improving solution quality and coordination.

Method: The authors propose providing localized spatiotemporal guidance cues near each agent to mitigate congestion, implemented on a configuration-based MAPF solver, LaCAM.

Result: Empirical evidence shows that localized guidance enhances MAPF solution quality significantly while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Localized guidance offers a practical, efficient alternative to global congestion management in MAPF, setting a new performance benchmark for LaCAM.

Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of
real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers
additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global
scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire
workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby
improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an
alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent.
While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may
appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying
informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve
solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to
LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes
a new performance frontier for MAPF.

TL;DR: The paper presents SORA-ATMAS, an agentic AI framework that addresses governance challenges in smart cities, ensuring accountable and adaptive decision-making across domains such as weather, traffic, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen well-being in smart cities while addressing governance, risk, and compliance challenges in decentralized systems.

Method: Utilizing SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather, Traffic, Safety) to analyze governance policies, fallback mechanisms, scalability, and safe interoperability across multiple large language models.

Result: SORA-ATMAS showed stable monitoring, effective handling of high-risk scenarios, adaptive trust regulation, scalable performance, and reduced error rates (35% MAE reduction).

Conclusion: SORA-ATMAS is a regulation-aligned framework that integrates domain agents to enable resilient, accountable, real-time decision-making for smart-city management.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of smart cities has increased the reliance on intelligent
interconnected services to optimize infrastructure, resources, and citizen
well-being. Agentic AI has emerged as a key enabler by supporting autonomous
decision-making and adaptive coordination, allowing urban systems to respond in
real time to dynamic conditions. Its benefits are evident in areas such as
transportation, where the integration of traffic data, weather forecasts, and
safety sensors enables dynamic rerouting and a faster response to hazards.
However, its deployment across heterogeneous smart city ecosystems raises
critical governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) challenges, including
accountability, data privacy, and regulatory alignment within decentralized
infrastructures. Evaluation of SORA-ATMAS with three domain agents (Weather,
Traffic, and Safety) demonstrated that its governance policies, including a
fallback mechanism for high-risk scenarios, effectively steer multiple LLMs
(GPT, Grok, DeepSeek) towards domain-optimized, policy-aligned outputs,
producing an average MAE reduction of 35% across agents. Results showed stable
weather monitoring, effective handling of high-risk traffic plateaus 0.85, and
adaptive trust regulation in Safety/Fire scenarios 0.65. Runtime profiling of a
3-agent deployment confirmed scalability, with throughput between 13.8-17.2
requests per second, execution times below 72~ms, and governance delays under
100 ms, analytical projections suggest maintained performance at larger scales.
Cross-domain rules ensured safe interoperability, with traffic rerouting
permitted only under validated weather conditions. These findings validate
SORA-ATMAS as a regulation-aligned, context-aware, and verifiable governance
framework that consolidates distributed agent outputs into accountable,
real-time decisions, offering a resilient foundation for smart-city management.

Conclusion: ColorAgent demonstrates significant advancements in OS agent design but highlights gaps in current benchmarks for comprehensive evaluation, suggesting areas for future exploration such as evaluation methodologies and agent security.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model
technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved
from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions.
Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions
and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical
report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,
robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and
proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the
environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise
reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a
tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and
robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent
recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an
automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on
the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%
and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we
note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of
OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly
in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our

Conclusion: The approach of combining LLMs with agent-based simulations holds promise for developing smarter transport systems. Future work involves scaling the framework, integrating real-time data, and refining agent memory models.

Abstract: Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in
order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This
paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior
in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in
Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based
simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework
integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent,
along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport,
and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the
interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent
interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment
from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative
agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes.
Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware
transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining
LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing
intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility
solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future
work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining
memory models.

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: This paper studies how active particles like foragers exhibit swarming behaviors as a response to partial environmental observability, using an evolutionary strategy applied to recurrent neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how active particles, specifically non-cooperative foragers, self-organize and demonstrate swarming behavior under conditions of partial observability.

Method: The paper simulates self-propelled foragers with stochastic position updates performing tasks in a 2D space using a continuous-time recurrent neural network evolved via evolutionary strategies.

Result: Agents learn adaptive foraging behaviors and exhibit swarming behavior (aggregation) when no resource patches are present, with swarming strength related to their stored resource levels.

Conclusion: Swarming behaviors in non-cooperative foragers are influenced by resource availability and partial observability, supporting risk-sensitive foraging claims. Hidden states of learned controllers play a key role in this behavior.

Abstract: Active particles are entities that sustain persistent out-of-equilibrium
motion by consuming energy. Under certain conditions, they exhibit the tendency
to self-organize through coordinated movements, such as swarming via
aggregation. While performing non-cooperative foraging tasks, the emergence of
such swarming behavior in foragers, exemplifying active particles, has been
attributed to the partial observability of the environment, in which the
presence of another forager can serve as a proxy signal to indicate the
potential presence of a food source or a resource patch. In this paper, we
validate this phenomenon by simulating multiple self-propelled foragers as they
forage from multiple resource patches in a non-cooperative manner. These
foragers operate in a continuous two-dimensional space with stochastic position
updates and partial observability. We evolve a shared policy in the form of a
continuous-time recurrent neural network that serves as a velocity controller
for the foragers. To this end, we use an evolutionary strategy algorithm
wherein the different samples of the policy-distribution are evaluated in the
same rollout. Then we show that agents are able to learn to adaptively forage
in the environment. Next, we show the emergence of swarming in the form of
aggregation among the foragers when resource patches are absent. We observe
that the strength of this swarming behavior appears to be inversely
proportional to the amount of resource stored in the foragers, which supports
the risk-sensitive foraging claims. Empirical analysis of the learned
controller's hidden states in minimal test runs uncovers their sensitivity to
the amount of resource stored in a forager. Clamping these hidden states to
represent a lesser amount of resource hastens its learned aggregation behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current electromagnetic field simulation methods for wireless power transfer systems are computationally intensive and struggle with systems sensitive to positional and geometrical changes, necessitating an improved approach.

Method: A machine learning technique, GPR, is introduced alongside 3D adaptive grid systems and active learning to estimate the nonlinear interactions between geometry and magnetic fields.

Result: Magnetic fields and power transfer efficiency were estimated with sub-second latency and an average error of less than 6%, validated against electromagnetic simulation results.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning-enabled approach significantly improves simulation speed and accuracy, offering practical benefits for dynamic applications in wireless power systems.

Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) with coupled resonators offers a promising
solution for the seamless powering of electronic devices. Interactive design
approaches that visualize the magnetic field and power transfer efficiency
based on system geometry adjustments can facilitate the understanding and
exploration of the behavior of these systems for dynamic applications. However,
typical electromagnetic field simulation methods, such as the Method of Moments
(MoM), require significant computational resources, limiting the rate at which
computation can be performed for acceptable interactivity. Furthermore, the
system's sensitivity to positional and geometrical changes necessitates a large
number of simulations, and structures such as ferromagnetic shields further
complicate these simulations. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach
using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), demonstrating for the first time the
rapid estimation of the entire magnetic field and power transfer efficiency for
near-field coupled systems. To achieve quick and accurate estimation, we
develop 3D adaptive grid systems and an active learning strategy to effectively
capture the nonlinear interactions between complex system geometries and
magnetic fields. By training a regression model, our approach achieves magnetic
field computation with sub-second latency and with an average error of less
than 6% when validated against independent electromagnetic simulation results.

Result: AMAuT achieves up to 99.8% accuracy on benchmarks, using less than 3% of the GPU hours required by comparable models.

Conclusion: AMAuT demonstrates an efficient, flexible, and high-performing alternative to large pre-trained models, ideal for resource-constrained audio classification applications.

Abstract: Recent foundational models, SSAST, EAT, HuBERT, Qwen-Audio, and Audio
Flamingo, achieve top-tier results across standard audio benchmarks but are
limited by fixed input rates and durations, hindering their reusability. This
paper introduces the Augmentation-driven Multiview Audio Transformer (AMAuT), a
training-from-scratch framework that eliminates the dependency on pre-trained
weights while supporting arbitrary sample rates and audio lengths. AMAuT
integrates four key components: (1) augmentation-driven multiview learning for
robustness, (2) a conv1 + conv7 + conv1 one-dimensional CNN bottleneck for
stable temporal encoding, (3) dual CLS + TAL tokens for bidirectional context
representation, and (4) test-time adaptation/augmentation (TTA^2) to improve
inference reliability. Experiments on five public benchmarks, AudioMNIST,
SpeechCommands V1 & V2, VocalSound, and CochlScene, show that AMAuT achieves
accuracies up to 99.8% while consuming less than 3% of the GPU hours required
by comparable pre-trained models. Thus, AMAuT presents a highly efficient and
flexible alternative to large pre-trained models, making state-of-the-art audio
classification accessible in computationally constrained settings.

### [351] [StutterZero and StutterFormer: End-to-End Speech Conversion for Stuttering Transcription and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18938)
*Qianheng Xu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces two models, StutterZero and StutterFormer, that convert stuttered speech directly into fluent speech and transcribe simultaneously, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions globally suffer from stuttering, and current automatic speech systems fail to handle disfluencies accurately, necessitating better solutions for stutter-to-fluent speech conversion.

Method: The paper proposes two end-to-end waveform-to-waveform architectures: StutterZero (using convolutional-bidirectional LSTM with attention) and StutterFormer (dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations), trained on paired stuttered-fluent data.

Result: StutterZero reduced Word Error Rate (WER) by 24% and improved semantic similarity (BERTScore) by 31%, while StutterFormer achieved a 28% WER reduction and a 34% improvement in BERTScore compared to Whisper-Medium.

Conclusion: Direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion is feasible and significantly enhances human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility in AI systems.

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic
speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them
accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature
extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech
(TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and
often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer,
the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert
stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription.
StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with
attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with
shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on
paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter
corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across
all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a
31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading
Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%
decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the
feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering
new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and
accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Speech deepfakes are increasingly used for malicious purposes like fraud. Many anti-spoofing systems perform poorly under physical replay attacks. EchoFake, a dataset with varied conditions and replay recordings, improves generalization and detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in anti-spoofing systems which struggle against physical replay attacks, a common form of fraud and identity theft.

Method: Developed and utilized EchoFake, a comprehensive dataset with diverse audio conditions and recordings featuring synthetic and replayed speech to train improved detection models.

Result: Baseline detection models trained on EchoFake demonstrated better generalization and achieved lower average Error Equal Rates across datasets.

Conclusion: EchoFake provides a realistic and practical foundation to enhance anti-spoofing systems by introducing challenges relevant to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of speech deepfakes has raised serious concerns,
particularly in real-world scenarios such as telephone fraud and identity
theft. While many anti-spoofing systems have demonstrated promising performance
on lab-generated synthetic speech, they often fail when confronted with
physical replay attacks-a common and low-cost form of attack used in practical
settings. Our experiments show that models trained on existing datasets exhibit
severe performance degradation, with average accuracy dropping to 59.6% when
evaluated on replayed audio. To bridge this gap, we present EchoFake, a
comprehensive dataset comprising more than 120 hours of audio from over 13,000
speakers, featuring both cutting-edge zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) speech and
physical replay recordings collected under varied devices and real-world
environmental settings. Additionally, we evaluate three baseline detection
models and show that models trained on EchoFake achieve lower average EERs
across datasets, indicating better generalization. By introducing more
practical challenges relevant to real-world deployment, EchoFake offers a more
realistic foundation for advancing spoofing detection methods.

### [354] [LAPRAD: LLM-Assisted PRotocol Attack Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19264)
*R. Can Aygun,Yehuda Afek,Anat Bremler-Barr,Leonard Kleinrock*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LAPRAD methodology, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to uncover vulnerabilities in DNS protocols. The authors identify three novel DDoS attacks that highlight flaws in DNS security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to enhance the security of critical Internet protocols, such as DNS and BGP, by finding methods to efficiently and semi-automatically identify vulnerabilities.

Method: The proposed LAPRAD methodology involves three stages: consulting a trained LLM to identify exploits, using another LLM to construct attack configurations via LangChain, and validating the effectiveness of the attacks.

Result: Using LAPRAD, the paper discovers three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and re-identifies two recent attacks. The new attacks include techniques like bait-and-switch for fake DNSSEC records, exploits targeting large encryption algorithms, and abuse of ANY-type responses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how LAPRAD can efficiently detect critical vulnerabilities in DNS protocols, exposing weaknesses and challenge current patches, thus aiding in improving Internet protocol security.

Abstract: With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek
faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols
such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted
Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers
with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would
otherwise be hard to detect.
  LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM
(GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and
previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a
different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations
using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation).
Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and
effectiveness.
  Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and
rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's
training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to
trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving
capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption
algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently
implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to
produce a similar effect.
  These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush,
circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and
impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.

*Mete Harun Akcay,Buse Gul Atli,Siddharth Prakash Rao,Alexandros Bakas*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system for trusted data sharing with policy-based selective encryption of sensitive information to ensure scalability, effectiveness, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of stored data necessitates robust protection mechanisms for sensitive information, especially in multi-user environments with diverse roles and permissions.

Method: The proposed system employs a hybrid encryption scheme, integrating symmetric encryption for performance and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. It comprises four core modules for automated sensitive region detection, post-correction, key management, and access control. The system is assessed on visual datasets by detecting and securely sharing Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images.

Result: The system enhances detection accuracy with a 5% increase in macro-averaged F1 score and a 10% boost in mean Average Precision. It also ensures rapid decryption with average policy-enforced decryption times under 1 second per image.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates its capability to securely manage large-scale data repositories, enabling efficient and precise access control while safeguarding privacy-sensitive data.

Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting
sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly
challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles
and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data
sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of
sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture
integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive
regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions
are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for
efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system
supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen
overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on
visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically
detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data
repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO
detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision
(10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1
second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.

### [356] [OpenGuardrails: An Open-Source Context-Aware AI Guardrails Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19169)
*Thomas Wang,Haowen Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OpenGuardrails is an open-source project designed to safeguard large language models from unsafe content, manipulation, data leakage, and privacy-related risks. It incorporates a context-aware safety and manipulation detection model alongside a deployable platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address rising safety concerns with LLMs, such as malicious content generation, privacy violations, and manipulative attacks, ensuring secure real-world applications.

Method: It includes a unified large model for safety and manipulation detection, supplemented by a lightweight Named Entity Recognition pipeline for data leakage prevention, deployable as a security gateway or API service.

Result: OpenGuardrails demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on safety benchmarks across multiple languages, establishing its effectiveness in safeguarding applications.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that OpenGuardrails provides a deployable, open-source solution with enterprise-grade capability to improve LLM safety and usability, and releases models under Apache 2.0 for public use.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, safeguarding them against unsafe, malicious, or
privacy-violating content is critically important. We present OpenGuardrails,
the first open-source project to provide both a context-aware safety and
manipulation detection model and a deployable platform for comprehensive AI
guardrails. OpenGuardrails protects against content-safety risks,
model-manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking,
code-interpreter abuse, and the generation/execution of malicious code), and
data leakage. Content-safety and model-manipulation detection are implemented
by a unified large model, while data-leakage identification and redaction are
performed by a separate lightweight NER pipeline (e.g., Presidio-style models
or regex-based detectors). The system can be deployed as a security gateway or
an API-based service, with enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options.
OpenGuardrails achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on safety
benchmarks, excelling in both prompt and response classification across
English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks. All models are released under the
Apache 2.0 license for public use.

*Chengcan Wu,Zhixin Zhang,Mingqian Xu,Zeming Wei,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic defense mechanism for MAS graph structures to address trustworthiness issues in large language model-based multi-agent systems, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MAS defense methods predominantly focus on static graph structures, which do not adequately address evolving and diverse dynamic attacks in MAS environments.

Method: A dynamic defense paradigm is introduced that continuously monitors communication within MAS graphs, dynamically adjusts their topology, and disrupts malicious communications effectively.

Result: The proposed method outpaced existing MAS defense techniques when tested in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS scenarios.

Conclusion: The dynamic defense paradigm advances trustworthy applications of MAS, providing effective protection against communication-based attacks and dynamic threats.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have become a
popular paradigm of AI applications. However, trustworthiness issues in MAS
remain a critical concern. Unlike challenges in single-agent systems, MAS
involve more complex communication processes, making them susceptible to
corruption attacks. To mitigate this issue, several defense mechanisms have
been developed based on the graph representation of MAS, where agents represent
nodes and communications form edges. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly
focus on static graph defense, attempting to either detect attacks in a fixed
graph structure or optimize a static topology with certain defensive
capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic defense paradigm
for MAS graph structures, which continuously monitors communication within the
MAS graph, then dynamically adjusts the graph topology, accurately disrupts
malicious communications, and effectively defends against evolving and diverse
dynamic attacks. Experimental results in increasingly complex and dynamic MAS
environments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing MAS
defense mechanisms, contributing an effective guardrail for their trustworthy
applications. Our code is available at

### [358] [HAMLOCK: HArdware-Model LOgically Combined attacK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19145)
*Sanskar Amgain,Daniel Lobo,Atri Chatterjee,Swarup Bhunia,Fnu Suya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: HAMLOCK combines hardware and software elements for stealthy DNN backdoor attacks, evading detection entirely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional model-level backdoor attacks are traceable and detectable due to embedded attack logic in software DNN layers, creating the need for a stealthier alternative.

Method: HAMLOCK spreads the attack logic across hardware-software boundaries with minimal model alterations and malicious hardware Trojans for detecting and manipulating activations.

Result: HAMLOCK achieves near-perfect attack success rates, negligible accuracy drops, and escapes state-of-the-art defenses while being undetectable on hardware with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: HAMLOCK unveils a critical vulnerability at the hardware-software interface, necessitating new cross-layer defenses.

Abstract: The growing use of third-party hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) for
deep neural networks (DNNs) introduces new security vulnerabilities.
Conventional model-level backdoor attacks, which only poison a model's weights
to misclassify inputs with a specific trigger, are often detectable because the
entire attack logic is embedded within the model (i.e., software), creating a
traceable layer-by-layer activation path.
  This paper introduces the HArdware-Model Logically Combined Attack (HAMLOCK),
a far stealthier threat that distributes the attack logic across the
hardware-software boundary. The software (model) is now only minimally altered
by tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation
values when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those
unique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant
bit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly
manipulate the final output logits for misclassification.
  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no
complete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears
fully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible
clean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art
model-level defenses without any adaptive optimization. The hardware Trojan is
also undetectable, incurring area and power overheads as low as 0.01%, which is
easily masked by process and environmental noise. Our findings expose a
critical vulnerability at the hardware-software interface, demanding new
cross-layer defenses against this emerging threat.

*Mohamed ElShehaby,Ashraf Matrawy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Increasing the layer depth in Deep Neural Networks does not universally enhance adversarial robustness, especially in Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address whether the depth of deep neural networks impacts their robustness against adversarial attacks, specifically within the NIDS domain.

Method: The adversarial robustness of DNNs was evaluated by comparing deep neural networks across the NIDS and computer vision domains.

Result: In the NIDS domain, adding more layers may degrade robustness against adversarial attacks, whereas in the computer vision domain, deeper layers have a modest impact on robustness.

Conclusion: Increasing layer depth does not guarantee improved adversarial robustness in NIDS and may negatively influence it, guiding the design of robust neural networks tailored for specific applications.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges to Machine Learning (ML)
systems and especially Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by subtly manipulating
inputs to induce incorrect predictions. This paper investigates whether
increasing the layer depth of deep neural networks affects their robustness
against adversarial attacks in the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
domain. We compare the adversarial robustness of various deep neural networks
across both \ac{NIDS} and computer vision domains (the latter being widely used
in adversarial attack experiments). Our experimental results reveal that in the
NIDS domain, adding more layers does not necessarily improve their performance,
yet it may actually significantly degrade their robustness against adversarial
attacks. Conversely, in the computer vision domain, adding more layers exhibits
a more modest impact on robustness. These findings can guide the development of
robust neural networks for (NIDS) applications and highlight the unique
characteristics of network security domains within the (ML) landscape.

TL;DR: This paper investigates power-saving techniques in HPC and datacenter networks, proposing improvements to energy efficiency while minimizing performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable and sustainable systems due to rising computational and operational costs drives this study.

Method: The authors used Energy Efficient Ethernet and extended their analysis to conventional and future Ethernet interconnects via simulations and traffic pattern studies.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that optimized power-saving techniques could reduce energy consumption effectively, with minimal performance compromise.

Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into dynamic power-down mechanisms and proposes energy-efficient solutions tailored to Ethernet-based HPC architectures.

Abstract: The increase in computation and storage has led to a significant growth in
the scale of systems powering applications and services, raising concerns about
sustainability and operational costs. In this paper, we explore power-saving
techniques in high-performance computing (HPC) and datacenter networks, and
their relation with performance degradation. From this premise, we propose
leveraging Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), with the flexibility to extend to
conventional Ethernet or upcoming Ethernet-derived interconnect versions of BXI
and Omnipath.
  We analyze the PerfBound proposal, identifying possible improvements and
modeling it into a simulation framework. Through different experiments, we
examine its impact on performance and determine the most appropriate
interconnect. We also study traffic patterns generated by selected HPC and
machine learning applications to evaluate the behavior of power-saving
techniques.
  From these experiments, we provide an analysis of how applications affect
system and network energy consumption. Based on this, we disclose the weakness
of dynamic power-down mechanisms and propose an approach that improves energy
reduction with minimal or no performance penalty. To our knowledge, this is the
first power management proposal tailored to future Ethernet-based HPC
architectures, with promising results.

TL;DR: SWOT is an optical network framework designed to enhance collective communication in distributed machine learning by employing dynamic intra-collective reconfiguration and improved scheduling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of distributed machine learning workloads necessitates scalable and efficient optical network solutions. Existing static network configurations lack adaptability, which limits performance and scalability.

Method: SWOT introduces demand-aware optical network reconfigurations coupled with a scheduling technique that overlaps switch reconfigurations with transmissions. It also features a lightweight integration layer for communication libraries.

Result: Simulations show notable performance improvements with SWOT compared to traditional static optical interconnect solutions.

Conclusion: SWOT offers a scalable and dynamic solution for collective communication in distributed machine learning, addressing the limitations of static reconfiguration strategies with efficiency and adaptability.

Abstract: Collective communication (CC) is widely adopted for large-scale distributed
machine learning (DML) training workloads. DML's predictable traffic pattern
provides a great oppotunity for applying optical network technology. Existing
optical interconnects-based CC schemes adopt ``one-shot network
reconfiguration'', which provisions static high-capacity topologies for an
entire collective operation -- sometimes for a full training iteration.
However, this approach faces significant scalability limitations when
supporting more complex and efficient CC algorithms required for modern
workloads: the ``one-shot'' strategies either demand excessive resource
overprovisioning or suffer performance degradation due to rigid resource
allocation.
  To address these challenges, we propose SWOT, a demand-aware optical network
framework. SWOT employs ``intra-collective reconfiguration'' and can
dynamically align network resources with CC traffic patterns. SWOT incorporates
a novel scheduling technique that overlaps optical switch reconfigurations with
ongoing transmissions, and improves communication efficiency. SWOT introduce a
lightweight collective communication shim that enables coordinated optical
network configuration and transmission scheduling while supporting seamless
integration with existing CC libraries. Our simulation results demonstrate
SWOT's significant performance improvements.

TL;DR: The study integrates decision-tree models, large language models (LLMs), and practitioner input for accurate, interpretable, and actionable case-level predictions. It demonstrates a viable pathway for adopting AI responsibly in public and nonprofit sectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public and nonprofit organizations often avoid AI tools due to the opacity of most models. The motivation is to create transparent, actionable AI solutions that can provide case-level guidance and gain practitioner trust while improving usability.

Method: The study uses interpretable decision trees to identify key predictors and pairs them with LLMs to emulate case-level predictions based on tree structures. Practitioners are actively involved in every stage, ensuring field expertise informs analysis and usability.

Result: The integration of transparent decision-tree models, LLMs, and practitioner input enhances predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and the ability to generate actionable insights for individual cases.

Conclusion: Combining transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input fosters responsible AI adoption in public and nonprofit sectors by delivering trustworthy and actionable case-level evaluations.

Abstract: Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because
most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze
aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This
study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent
decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive
accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using
data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision
trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an
LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the
transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering,
model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field
expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating
transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy,
and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for
responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of six large language models (LLMs) in describing computing career expectations in Africa, uncovering disparities in contextual awareness, ethical considerations, and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Employers in Africa increasingly require graduates to use LLMs in computing roles, but varying national contexts make the required competencies unclear.

Method: Researchers analyzed 60 LLM responses using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework, Digital Colonialism Theory, and Ubuntu Philosophy, evaluating both technical and non-technical competencies.

Result: Open-source models outperformed proprietary ones in contextual awareness and skill balance, although all models struggled with cultural sensitivity and local infrastructure considerations.

Conclusion: Current AI tools are influenced by Western-centric biases and infrastructure assumptions, highlighting the need for decolonial approaches to AI education that focus on contextual relevance and local needs.

Abstract: Employers increasingly expect graduates to utilize large language models
(LLMs) in the workplace, yet the competencies needed for computing roles across
Africa remain unclear given varying national contexts. This study examined how
six LLMs, namely ChatGPT 4, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude 3.5, Llama 3, and Mistral
AI, describe entry-level computing career expectations across ten African
countries. Using the Computing Curricula 2020 framework and drawing on Digital
Colonialism Theory and Ubuntu Philosophy, we analyzed 60 LLM responses to
standardized prompts. Technical skills such as cloud computing and programming
appeared consistently, but notable differences emerged in how models addressed
non-technical competencies, particularly ethics and responsible AI use. Models
varied considerably in recognizing country-specific factors, including local
technology ecosystems, language requirements, and national policies.
Open-source models demonstrated stronger contextual awareness and a better
balance between technical and professional skills, earning top scores in nine
of ten countries. Still, all models struggled with cultural sensitivity and
infrastructure considerations, averaging only 35.4% contextual awareness. This
first broad comparison of LLM career guidance for African computing students
uncovers entrenched infrastructure assumptions and Western-centric biases,
creating gaps between technical recommendations and local needs. The strong

### [365] [A Justice Lens on Fairness and Ethics Courses in Computing Education: LLM-Assisted Multi-Perspective and Thematic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18931)

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a justice-oriented scoring rubric with a large language model (LLM) to analyze and improve fairness, ethics, and justice content in AI/ML course syllabi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Course syllabi are critical for shaping learning experiences, especially in computing fields addressing fairness and ethics in AI/ML. Understanding how barriers to fair outcomes are approached in course design is essential.

Method: A justice-oriented scoring rubric was developed, and a large language model (LLM) evaluated syllabi using multi-perspective role simulation (instructor, departmental chair, institutional reviewer, external evaluator). The LLM also identified thematic trends.

Result: Four perspectives were used in evaluating 24 syllabi, revealing role-specific priorities and gaps in curricula design. Insights highlighted necessary improvements in addressing fairness and ethics in AI/ML courses.

Conclusion: Multiperspective syllabus evaluation using LLM is effective in uncovering gaps and guiding improvements in curricula regarding fairness, ethics, and justice content in AI/ML and computing courses.

Abstract: Course syllabi set the tone and expectations for courses, shaping the
learning experience for both students and instructors. In computing courses,
especially those addressing fairness and ethics in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and algorithmic design, it is imperative that we
understand how approaches to navigating barriers to fair outcomes are being
addressed.These expectations should be inclusive, transparent, and grounded in
promoting critical thinking. Syllabus analysis offers a way to evaluate the
coverage, depth, practices, and expectations within a course. Manual syllabus
evaluation, however, is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. To address
this, we developed a justice-oriented scoring rubric and asked a large language
model (LLM) to review syllabi through a multi-perspective role simulation.
Using this rubric, we evaluated 24 syllabi from four perspectives: instructor,
departmental chair, institutional reviewer, and external evaluator. We also
prompted the LLM to identify thematic trends across the courses. Findings show
that multiperspective evaluation aids us in noting nuanced, role-specific
priorities, leveraging them to fill hidden gaps in curricula design of AI/ML
and related computing courses focused on fairness and ethics. These insights
offer concrete directions for improving the design and delivery of fairness,
ethics, and justice content in such courses.

### [366] [REPAIR Approach for Social-based City Reconstruction Planning in case of natural disasters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19048)
*Ghulam Mudassir,Antinisca Di Marco,Giordano d'Aloisio*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper extends prior research on a decision support system using Deep Reinforcement Learning for post-disaster reconstruction, integrating additional deep learning models and a random agent baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in post-disaster city reconstruction by maximizing social benefits, addressing resource constraints, and considering stakeholder needs.

Method: Deep Reinforcement Learning (REPAIR framework) to determine optimal reconstruction plans with comparative analysis using additional deep learning models and a baseline random agent.

Result: Illustrates the REPAIR framework applied on a real-world use case: the 2009 earthquake reconstruction in L'Aquila; providing alternative reconstruction plans that local administrators can implement.

Conclusion: The REPAIR framework is flexible, efficient, and broadly applicable for planning post-disaster reconstructions, aiding governments to better utilize available resources.

Abstract: Natural disasters always have several effects on human lives. It is
challenging for governments to tackle these incidents and to rebuild the
economic, social and physical infrastructures and facilities with the available
resources (mainly budget and time). Governments always define plans and
policies according to the law and political strategies that should maximise
social benefits. The severity of damage and the vast resources needed to bring
life back to normality make such reconstruction a challenge. This article is
the extension of our previously published work by conducting comprehensive
comparative analysis by integrating additional deep learning models plus random
agent which is used as a baseline. Our prior research introduced a decision
support system by using the Deep Reinforcement Learning technique for the
planning of post-disaster city reconstruction, maximizing the social benefit of
the reconstruction process, considering available resources, meeting the needs
of the broad community stakeholders (like citizens' social benefits and
politicians' priorities) and keeping in consideration city's structural
constraints (like dependencies among roads and buildings). The proposed
approach, named post disaster REbuilding plAn ProvIdeR (REPAIR) is generic. It
can determine a set of alternative plans for local administrators who select
the ideal one to implement, and it can be applied to areas of any extension. We
show the application of REPAIR in a real use case, i.e., to the L'Aquila
reconstruction process, damaged in 2009 by a major earthquake.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-modal approach to simulating online shopping behavior, integrating both text and visual data to better capture human decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches in behavior simulation rely solely on text-based inputs, neglecting the significance of visual perception in shaping human decisions during online interactions.

Method: The study incorporates visual data (webpage screenshots) into behavior simulations using VLMs and employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for joint action prediction and rationale generation. Reinforcement learning (RL) with a hierarchical reward structure is also used to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: The addition of visual inputs led to a 6% improvement in exact match accuracy compared to text-only inputs, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy and simulation precision in visually complex environments.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-modal (text and visual) inputs significantly enhances the fidelity and accuracy of human behavior simulation frameworks. The paper identifies key limitations in current methods and offers directions for future research on the topic.

Abstract: LLMs have recently demonstrated strong potential in simulating online shopper
behavior. Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action
traces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance
reasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on
text-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in
shaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we
investigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage
screenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By
grounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim
to narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby
enabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior.
Specifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale
generation, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises
action history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot. To
further enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical
reward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes
challenging decision points. Empirically, our studies show that incorporating
visual grounding yields substantial gains: the combination of text and image
inputs improves exact match accuracy by more than 6% over text-only inputs.
These results indicate that multi-modal grounding not only boosts predictive
accuracy but also enhances simulation fidelity in visually complex
environments, which captures nuances of human attention and decision-making
that text-only agents often miss. Finally, we revisit the design space of
behavior simulation frameworks, identify key methodological limitations, and
propose future research directions toward building efficient and effective
human behavior simulators.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWM-AP, a method using hierarchical social world models to improve mechanism design for heterogeneous agents in multi-agent systems, demonstrating superior results in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of aligning individual and collective interests in artificial social intelligence systems dealing with heterogeneous agents and complex dynamics, while ensuring high sample efficiency due to costly real-world interactions.

Method: The method involves Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy Learning (SWM-AP), which uses a hierarchical social world model to infer agents' latent traits and predict responses, thus enhancing mechanism design and policy learning sample efficiency.

Result: SWM-AP leads to superior cumulative rewards and sample efficiency compared to other model-based and model-free RL approaches in experiments across various scenarios like tax policy design, team coordination, and facility location.

Conclusion: The proposed SWM-AP method proves to be a promising and effective tool for improving mechanism design in diverse and complex artificial social intelligence setups, especially with heterogeneous agents.

Abstract: Designing adaptive mechanisms to align individual and collective interests
remains a central challenge in artificial social intelligence. Existing methods
often struggle with modeling heterogeneous agents possessing persistent latent
traits (e.g., skills, preferences) and dealing with complex multi-agent system
dynamics. These challenges are compounded by the critical need for high sample
efficiency due to costly real-world interactions. World Models, by learning to
predict environmental dynamics, offer a promising pathway to enhance mechanism
design in heterogeneous and complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method named SWM-AP (Social World Model-Augmented Mechanism Design Policy
Learning), which learns a social world model hierarchically modeling agents'
behavior to enhance mechanism design. Specifically, the social world model
infers agents' traits from their interaction trajectories and learns a
trait-based model to predict agents' responses to the deployed mechanisms. The
mechanism design policy collects extensive training trajectories by interacting
with the social world model, while concurrently inferring agents' traits online
during real-world interactions to further boost policy learning efficiency.
Experiments in diverse settings (tax policy design, team coordination, and
facility location) demonstrate that SWM-AP outperforms established model-based
and model-free RL baselines in cumulative rewards and sample efficiency.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study examines the use of AI in a foundational design course for engineering and architecture students, focusing on its role as a tool, teammate, or neither, and its impact on innovation and reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring how AI can be effectively integrated into design education to foster innovation and ethical considerations.

Method: Students engaged with AI-enhanced design interventions and reflected on their use of AI under three categories: tool, teammate, or non-use, supported by structured coursework artifacts and qualitative analysis.

Result: Students developed practices like accelerated prototyping, selective non-use of AI, and workflows for dealing with AI hallucinations, enhancing both efficiency and innovation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that embedding structured AI interactions in education can scale innovation while ensuring accountability and cultivating reflection on ethical and strategic use.

Abstract: This pilot study traces students' reflections on the use of AI in a 13-week
foundational design course enrolling over 500 first-year engineering and
architecture students at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. The
course was an AI-enhanced design course, with several interventions to equip
students with AI based design skills. Students were required to reflect on
whether the technology was used as a tool (instrumental assistant), a teammate
(collaborative partner), or neither (deliberate non-use). By foregrounding this
three-way lens, students learned to use AI for innovation rather than just
automation and to reflect on agency, ethics, and context rather than on prompt
crafting alone. Evidence stems from coursework artefacts: thirteen structured
reflection spreadsheets and eight illustrated briefs submitted, combined with
notes of teachers and researchers. Qualitative coding of these materials
reveals shared practices brought about through the inclusion of Gen-AI,
including accelerated prototyping, rapid skill acquisition, iterative prompt
refinement, purposeful "switch-offs" during user research, and emergent
routines for recognizing hallucinations. Unexpectedly, students not only
harnessed Gen-AI for speed but (enabled by the tool-teammate-neither triage)
also learned to reject its outputs, invent their own hallucination fire-drills,
and divert the reclaimed hours into deeper user research, thereby transforming
efficiency into innovation. The implications of the approach we explore shows
that: we can transform AI uptake into an assessable design habit; that
rewarding selective non-use cultivates hallucination-aware workflows; and,
practically, that a coordinated bundle of tool access, reflection, role
tagging, and public recognition through competition awards allows AI based
innovation in education to scale without compromising accountability.

*Tomás Dodds,Wang Ngai Yeung,Claudia Mellado,Mathias-Felipe de Lima-Santos*

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Dutch journalists are managing AI integration in their workflows using interviews and proposes the concept of "controlled change" as a framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore the challenges and opportunities AI technologies, like ChatGPT, bring to journalism, examining their impact on journalists' authority and newsroom practices.

Method: The research utilizes qualitative methods by conducting 13 interviews with editors, journalists, and innovation managers in Dutch media organizations.

Result: Journalists are employing three primary mechanisms to manage AI integration: creating adaptive ethical guidelines, experimenting with AI tools, and critically evaluating their capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: Journalists are proactively managing AI integration through supervised practices that preserve their professional authority while adapting to technological changes.

Abstract: Using (generative) artificial intelligence tools and systems in journalism is
expected to increase journalists' production rates, transform newsrooms'
economic models, and further personalize the audience's news consumption
practices. Since its release in 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT and other large language
models have raised the alarms inside news organizations, not only for bringing
new challenges to news reporting and fact-checking but also for what these
technologies would mean for journalists' professional authority in journalism.
This paper examines how journalists in Dutch media manage the integration of AI
technologies into their daily routines. Drawing from 13 interviews with
editors, journalists, and innovation managers in different news outlets and
media companies, we propose the concept of controlled change. as a heuristic to
explain how journalists are proactively setting guidelines, experimenting with
AI tools, and identifying their limitations and capabilities. Using
professional authority as a theoretical framework, we argue that journalists
anticipate and integrate AI technologies in a supervised manner and identify
three primary mechanisms through which journalists manage this integration: (1)
developing adaptive guidelines that align AI use with ethical codes, (2)
experimenting with AI technologies to determine their necessity and fit, and
(3) critically assessing the capabilities and limitations of AI systems.

*Jake Freeman*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of anisotropic covariances in high-dimensional linear regression and introduces an innovative scaling of the minimum $_{2}$ norm interpolator to enhance generalization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ridge regularization methods don't work as expected when covariates are anisotropic and aligned with top population eigenvalues.

Method: Authors proposed scaling the minimum $_{2}$ norm interpolator and utilizing data-splitting techniques for consistent estimation under highly anisotropic covariances.

Result: Inflating the minimum $_{2}$ norm interpolator improved generalization errors, contradicting traditional shrinkage approaches.

Conclusion: Innovative scaling techniques and novel bounds reveal promising results, altering the trajectory for regularization in anisotropic linear regression systems.

Abstract: Hastie et al. (2022) found that ridge regularization is essential in high
dimensional linear regression $y=\beta^Tx + \epsilon$ with isotropic
co-variates $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $n$ samples at fixed $d/n$. However, Hastie
et al. (2022) also notes that when the co-variates are anisotropic and $\beta$
is aligned with the top eigenvalues of population covariance, the "situation is
qualitatively different." In the present article, we make precise this
observation for linear regression with highly anisotropic covariances and
diverging $d/n$. We find that simply scaling up (or inflating) the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm interpolator by a constant greater than one can improve the
generalization error. This is in sharp contrast to traditional
regularization/shrinkage prescriptions. Moreover, we use a data-splitting
technique to produce consistent estimators that achieve generalization error
comparable to that of the optimally inflated minimum-norm interpolator. Our
proof relies on apparently novel matching upper and lower bounds for
expectations of Gaussian random projections for a general class of anisotropic
covariance matrices when $d/n\to \infty$.

Motivation: To improve understanding of optimal transport-based filtering techniques and extend error analysis for practical applications in complex, non-Gaussian, and high-dimensional scenarios.

Method: Systematic error analysis of optimal transport algorithms and extension of error analysis to conditional Brenier maps. Numerical benchmarks are used to validate the effectiveness of an extended filtering algorithm.

Result: An extended optimal transport filtering algorithm demonstrates effectiveness in non-Gaussian and high-dimensional examples through numerical benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper advances the theory and application of optimal transport filtering methods, showing their practical potential for challenging data scenarios.

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of estimation errors for a class of optimal

we extend previous error analyses of Brenier maps to the case of conditional
Brenier maps that arise in the context of simulation based inference. We then
apply these results in a filtering scenario to analyze the optimal transport
filtering algorithm of Al-Jarrah et al. (2024, ICML). An extension of that
algorithm along with numerical benchmarks on various non-Gaussian and

*Marius Potfer,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores learning difficulties in two formats of repeated multi-unit auctions: uniform-price and discriminatory, focusing on bidders' regret scales under different conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and compare the learning difficulty and regret scales in uniform-price and discriminatory auctions formats for bidders learning to bid against stochastic adversaries.

Method: The study provides theoretical characterizations of learning difficulties and regret scaling in both auction formats under full-information and bandit feedback using formal analysis.

Result: Despite similar worst-case regret scaling for both auction formats, uniform-price auctions can exhibit faster regret reduction in specific scenarios compared to discriminatory auctions.

Conclusion: Uniform-price auctions might be preferable in certain cases due to potentially faster learning rates, which can influence strategic auction design and decision-making for bidders.

Abstract: Repeated multi-unit auctions, where a seller allocates multiple identical
items over many rounds, are common mechanisms in electricity markets and
treasury auctions. We compare the two predominant formats: uniform-price and
discriminatory auctions, focusing on the perspective of a single bidder
learning to bid against stochastic adversaries. We characterize the learning
difficulty in each format, showing that the regret scales similarly for both
auction formats under both full-information and bandit feedback, as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ and $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$, respectively.
However, analysis beyond worst-case regret reveals structural differences:
uniform-price auctions may admit faster learning rates, with regret scaling as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ in settings where discriminatory auctions remain
at $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$. Finally, we provide a specific analysis for
auctions in which the other participants are symmetric and have unit-demand,
and show that in these instances, a similar regret rate separation appears.

### [374] [Impartial Selection with Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19002)
*Javier Cembrano,Felix Fischer,Max Klimm*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper investigates impartial mechanisms in agent selection based on mutual nominations, improving upon existing performance bounds by incorporating predictive insights. It demonstrates enhanced consistency and robustness in such mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle agent selection where agents' nominations are influenced by self-interest. The challenge is to ensure fair selection processes that discourage misrepresentation of opinions while improving the mechanism's performance.

Method: The authors propose mechanisms that utilize predictions about highly nominated agents, providing theoretical bounds for consistency (when predictions are accurate) and robustness (when predictions are inaccurate). They generalize settings involving multiple agents and examine specific cases.

Result: For general cases, the proposed mechanism achieves a consistency of $1-O(1/k)$ and a robustness of $1-1/e-O(1/k)$. In specialized single-agent cases, they achieve perfect consistency (1-consistency) with reasonable robustness (1/2-robustness).

Conclusion: The paper concludes that optimal consistency in agent selection can be attained without significant compromise on robustness, thus balancing fairness and performance effectively in prediction-informed impartial mechanisms.

Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical
problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As
agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent
their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own
chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by
guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations
cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the
performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate
the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to
what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are
given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of
nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness
of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the
mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when
the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents
are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a
mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness
$1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a
single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that
$1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A
close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal
consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a protocol for fair evaluation of autobidding algorithms used in advertisement auctions, comparing classical and reinforcement learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable and fair evaluation of autobidding algorithms in advertisement auctions, which are central to e-commerce revenue generation.

Method: The authors utilize a recent open-source bidding environment and benchmark classical and RL-based autobidding algorithms using multiple performance-oriented metrics.

Result: The study identifies promising use cases, potential drawbacks of autobidding algorithms, and evaluates them in terms of efficiency, costs, and budget pacing.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation protocol aids e-commerce practitioners in assessing autobidding algorithms based on diverse metrics relevant to company goals.

Abstract: Advertisement auctions play a crucial role in revenue generation for
e-commerce companies. To make the bidding procedure scalable to thousands of
auctions, the automatic bidding (autobidding) algorithms are actively developed
in the industry. Therefore, the fair and reproducible evaluation of autobidding
algorithms is an important problem. We present a standardized and transparent
evaluation protocol for comparing classical and reinforcement learning (RL)
autobidding algorithms. We consider the most efficient autobidding algorithms
from different classes, e.g., ones based on the controllers, RL, optimal
formulas, etc., and benchmark them in the bidding environment. We utilize the
most recent open-source environment developed in the industry, which accurately
emulates the bidding process. Our work demonstrates the most promising use
cases for the considered autobidding algorithms, highlights their surprising
drawbacks, and evaluates them according to multiple metrics. We select the
evaluation metrics that illustrate the performance of the autobidding
algorithms, the corresponding costs, and track the budget pacing. Such a choice
of metrics makes our results applicable to the broad range of platforms where
autobidding is effective. The presented comparison results help practitioners
to evaluate the candidate autobidding algorithms from different perspectives
and select ones that are efficient according to their companies' targets.

TL;DR: This paper establishes that grounding meaning in a formal symbolic system is inherently an open-ended, non-algorithmic process due to foundational logical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the logical boundaries and constraints of the Symbol Grounding Problem, to understand how meaning can emerge in formal systems.

Method: Utilized a four-stage argument with formal proofs to analyze the constraints of purely symbolic systems, finite static systems, and the automation of connecting symbols to meanings.

Result: Demonstrated logical limitations of self-contained systems: symbolic systems cannot internally generate meaning, finite systems remain incomplete, and automated algorithms fail to solve meaning grounding.

Conclusion: Grounding meaning in symbolic systems requires an external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic process; thus, there are fundamental limits to the capacity of self-contained systems to generate meaning.

Abstract: This paper synthesizes a series of formal proofs to construct a unified
theory on the logical limits of the Symbol Grounding Problem. We demonstrate
through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise
from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove
that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot
internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to
self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with
any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently
incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very "act" of connecting an internal
symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within
the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that
any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external "judgment"
algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic
system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of
meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a
fundamental, G\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent
system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a model enabling a nuanced representation of strategy knowledge, capturing varying levels of awareness such as first-order, higher-order, and common knowledge.

Method: The authors propose theoretical refinements to the semantics of strategic reasoning and apply these to case studies like the game Hanabi and consensus problems.

Result: Higher-order strategy knowledge shapes reasoning outcomes in games, and common knowledge proves essential for reaching consensus. Model checking issues are also analyzed.

Conclusion: Fine-grained differentiation in strategy knowledge improves understanding in areas such as game mechanics and consensus algorithms, while raising decidability challenges in verification.

Abstract: Most existing work on strategic reasoning simply adopts either an informed or
an uninformed semantics. We propose a model where knowledge of strategies can
be specified on a fine-grained level. In particular, it is possible to
distinguish first-order, higher-order, and common knowledge of strategies. We
illustrate the effect of higher-order knowledge of strategies by studying the
game Hanabi. Further, we show that common knowledge of strategies is necessary
to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we study the decidability of the model
checking problem.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified theory connecting probabilistic systems, category theory, optimal transport, and quantitative modal logic, centered around the concept of $$-abstraction with mathematical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a coherent framework linking abstraction in probabilistic systems and logical semantics while balancing informativeness and value loss.

Method: Constructing canonical $$-quotients with universal properties, employing category theory and the Bellman operator. Introducing a quantitative modal $$-calculus and validating results through Markov decision processes.

Result: The framework showcases properties like contraction, value-loss bounds, stability, and scalability, offering robust tools for representation learning and state aggregation.

Conclusion: The paper presents a mathematically rigorous foundation for abstraction and representation in stochastic systems, with computational feasibility and robustness.

Abstract: A unified theory of quantitative abstraction is presented for probabilistic
systems that links category theory, optimal transport, and quantitative modal
logic. At its core is a canonical $ \varepsilon $-quotient endowed with a
universal property: among all $ \varepsilon $-abstractions, it is the most
informative one that respects a prescribed bound on value loss. This
construction induces an adjunction between abstraction and realization functors
$ (Q_{\varepsilon} \dashv R_{\varepsilon}) $, established via the Special
Adjoint Functor Theorem, revealing a categorical duality between metric
structure and logical semantics. A behavioral pseudometric is characterized as
the unique fixed point of a Bellman-style operator, with contraction and
Lipschitz properties proved in a coalgebraic setting. A quantitative modal $
\mu $-calculus is introduced and shown to be expressively complete for
logically representable systems, so that behavioral distance coincides with
maximal logical deviation. Compositionality under interface refinement is
analyzed, clarifying how abstractions interact across system boundaries. An
exact validation suite on finite Markov decision processes corroborates the
contraction property, value-loss bounds, stability under perturbation,
adversarial distinguishability, and scalability, demonstrating both robustness
and computational feasibility. The resulting framework provides principled
targets for state aggregation and representation learning, with mathematically
precise guarantees for value-function approximation in stochastic domains.

Conclusion: The proposed system demonstrates potential in reshaping collaborative learning and interaction patterns through LLM-assisted environments.

Abstract: For nearly two decades, conversational agents have played a critical role in
structuring interactions in collaborative learning, shaping group dynamics, and
supporting student engagement. The recent integration of large language models
(LLMs) into these agents offers new possibilities for fostering critical
thinking and collaborative problem solving. In this work, we begin with an open
source collaboration support architecture called Bazaar and integrate an
LLM-agent shell that enables introduction of LLM-empowered, real time, context
sensitive collaborative support for group learning. This design and
infrastructure paves the way for exploring how tailored LLM-empowered
environments can reshape collaborative learning outcomes and interaction
patterns.

discourse and regulation often focus more on risks than benefits. To address
this imbalance, we present LifeSync-Games, a framework leveraging simplified
digital twins to connect virtual gameplay with real-life activities. This
reciprocal relationship aims to enhance the developmental value of gaming by
promoting self-regulation and fostering growth across physical, mental, and
social domains. We present the framework's theoretical foundations,
technological components, design guidelines, and evaluation approaches.
Additionally, we present early applications in both new and bestselling games
to demonstrate its versatility and practical relevance.

TL;DR: Investigates inclusivity biases in user-facing AI products by identifying six types of inclusivity bugs and developing GenderMag-for-AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore barriers in user-facing AI products that exclude users with specific problem-solving approaches.

Method: Conducted a field study with three AI product teams to identify AI inclusivity bugs and adapt the GenderMag inclusive design method.

Result: Identified six types of inclusivity bugs, detected 83 instances, fixed 47 instances, and developed GenderMag-for-AI.

Conclusion: GenderMag-for-AI effectively identifies AI inclusivity bugs, helping developers design more inclusive AI products.

Abstract: While much research has shown the presence of AI's "under-the-hood" biases
(e.g., algorithmic, training data, etc.), what about "over-the-hood"
inclusivity biases: barriers in user-facing AI products that disproportionately
exclude users with certain problem-solving approaches? Recent research has
begun to report the existence of such biases -- but what do they look like, how
prevalent are they, and how can developers find and fix them? To find out, we
conducted a field study with 3 AI product teams, to investigate what kinds of
AI inclusivity bugs exist uniquely in user-facing AI products, and whether/how
AI product teams might harness an existing (non-AI-oriented) inclusive design
method to find and fix them. The teams' work resulted in identifying 6 types of
AI inclusivity bugs arising 83 times, fixes covering 47 of these bug instances,
and a new variation of the GenderMag inclusive design method, GenderMag-for-AI,
that is especially effective at detecting certain kinds of AI inclusivity bugs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve how conversational AIs address health concerns amidst risks of inaccuracies and bias, identifying design strategies for better user interaction.

Method: The authors conducted 4 mixed-method studies (total N=163) involving qualitative research and a randomized blinded study to understand user interaction and test a new "Wayfinding AI".

Result: Participants rated the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns compared to a baseline AI, validating proactive context-seeking approaches.

Conclusion: Proactive context-seeking in conversational AI significantly improves user satisfaction and suggests promising design strategies for navigating health-related topics.

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information
landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible
information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present
insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people
interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed
the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific
details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs
was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several
turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to
proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated
the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns
compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of
proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design
patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome data scarcity that limits scalable deployment of learning-to-defer systems for human-AI collaboration in real-world settings.

Method: A context-aware framework utilizes meta-learning to generate expert-specific embeddings and synthetic labels, ensuring adaptability to new experts through dual-purpose mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show rapid approach to oracle-level performance with synthetic labels, demonstrating the data efficiency of the framework.

Conclusion: The approach resolves training bottlenecks in learning-to-defer systems and contributes to scalable, practical human-AI collaboration solutions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical
deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a
context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate
expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the
efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to
generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to
enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment
results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these
synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the
data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this
work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for
human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current air quality management tools lack seamless integration of forecasting and visualization of spatial pollutant distributions, creating barriers for effective environmental planning and public health protection.

Method: The authors develop CityAQVis, a tool using machine learning to predict ground-level pollutant concentrations by integrating multi-source datasets such as satellite data, meteorological parameters, and population density. It enables users to compare predictive models and visualize spatial-temporal pollution patterns via a user-friendly GUI.

Result: CityAQVis demonstrated its efficacy in predicting and visualizing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in metropolitan areas, showcasing adaptability for diverse pollutant types.

Conclusion: ML-driven visual analytic tools like CityAQVis can enhance situational awareness, enabling data-driven decision-making in urban air quality management.

Abstract: Urban air pollution poses significant risks to public health, environmental
sustainability, and policy planning. Effective air quality management requires
predictive tools that can integrate diverse datasets and communicate complex
spatial and temporal pollution patterns. There is a gap in interactive tools
with seamless integration of forecasting and visualization of spatial
distributions of air pollutant concentrations. We present CityAQVis, an
interactive machine learning ML sandbox tool designed to predict and visualize
pollutant concentrations at the ground level using multi-source data, which
includes satellite observations, meteorological parameters, population density,
elevation, and nighttime lights. While traditional air quality visualization
tools often lack forecasting capabilities, CityAQVis enables users to build and
compare predictive models, visualizing the model outputs and offering insights
into pollution dynamics at the ground level. The pilot implementation of the
tool is tested through case studies predicting nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
concentrations in metropolitan regions, highlighting its adaptability to
various pollutants. Through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), the
user can perform comparative visualizations of the spatial distribution of
surface-level pollutant concentration in two different urban scenarios. Our
results highlight the potential of ML-driven visual analytics to improve
situational awareness and support data-driven decision-making in air quality
management.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines the impact of three types of AI-generated feedback (Directive, Metacognitive, Hybrid) in a semester-long trial involving 329 students and finds Hybrid feedback most effective in triggering revision behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the potential of AI-generated feedback in education and seeks to compare the impact of directive, metacognitive, and hybrid feedback on student engagement, confidence, and work quality.

Method: The study uses a semester-long randomized controlled trial with 329 students in an introductory course, assigning them to groups receiving either directive, metacognitive, or hybrid AI-generated feedback.

Result: Results showed that Hybrid feedback prompted the most revisions among students while confidence ratings remained high and work quality comparable across groups.

Conclusion: Hybrid AI-generated feedback is promising as it combines actionable guidance for improvement with self-reflection opportunities, supporting both immediate learning and metacognitive skill development.

Abstract: Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on student learning, with
extensive research examining how best to implement it in educational settings.
Increasingly, feedback is being generated by artificial intelligence (AI),
offering scalable and adaptive responses. Two widely studied approaches are
directive feedback, which gives explicit explanations and reduces cognitive
load to speed up learning, and metacognitive feedback which prompts learners to
reflect, track their progress, and develop self-regulated learning (SRL)
skills. While both approaches have clear theoretical advantages, their
comparative effects on engagement, confidence, and quality of work remain
underexplored. This study presents a semester-long randomised controlled trial
with 329 students in an introductory design and programming course using an
adaptive educational platform. Participants were assigned to receive directive,
metacognitive, or hybrid AI-generated feedback that blended elements of both
directive and metacognitive feedback. Results showed that revision behaviour
differed across feedback conditions, with Hybrid prompting the most revisions
compared to Directive and Metacognitive. Confidence ratings were uniformly
high, and resource quality outcomes were comparable across conditions. These
findings highlight the promise of AI in delivering feedback that balances
clarity with reflection. Hybrid approaches, in particular, show potential to
combine actionable guidance for immediate improvement with opportunities for
self-reflection and metacognitive growth.

TL;DR: This paper presents a news-aware reinforcement learning approach for trading decisions, using sentiment scores from large language models and market data, demonstrating better performance in cryptocurrency markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively incorporate news data into quantitative trading without relying on manually designed rules or handcrafted features.

Method: Integrates reinforcement learning algorithms (DDQN and GRPO) with news sentiment scores from large language models, processed via sequence models like RNNs or Transformers.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed approach outperforms market benchmarks in cryptocurrency trading.

Conclusion: The news-aware approach highlights the importance of time-series information and offers a promising methodology for improved trading decisions.

Abstract: The financial market is known to be highly sensitive to news. Therefore,
effectively incorporating news data into quantitative trading remains an
important challenge. Existing approaches typically rely on manually designed
rules and/or handcrafted features. In this work, we directly use the news
sentiment scores derived from large language models, together with raw price
and volume data, as observable inputs for reinforcement learning. These inputs
are processed by sequence models such as recurrent neural networks or
Transformers to make end-to-end trading decisions. We conduct experiments using
the cryptocurrency market as an example and evaluate two representative
reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The results demonstrate that our
news-aware approach, which does not depend on handcrafted features or manually
designed rules, can achieve performance superior to market benchmarks. We
further highlight the critical role of time-series information in this process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the loss of nuance during news translation and improve interpretability and usability of multilingual news for stock market analysis.

Method: The authors utilized optimal transport for aligning sentences in Bloomberg's English and Japanese articles, creating a semantically matched dataset for 140,000 article pairs.

Result: Aligned sentences exhibit higher semantic similarity and outperform full text samples in predicting stock returns, boosting Sharpe ratios by 10%.

Conclusion: Aligned sentence analysis demonstrates improved interpretability, correlation with stock returns, and better trading strategy outcomes compared to using untranslated full texts.

Abstract: News spreads rapidly across languages and regions, but translations may lose
subtle nuances. We propose a method to align sentences in multilingual news
articles using optimal transport, identifying semantically similar content
across languages. We apply this method to align more than 140,000 pairs of
Bloomberg English and Japanese news articles covering around 3500 stocks in
Tokyo exchange over 2012-2024. Aligned sentences are sparser, more
interpretable, and exhibit higher semantic similarity. Return scores
constructed from aligned sentences show stronger correlations with realized
stock returns, and long-short trading strategies based on these alignments
achieve 10\% higher Sharpe ratios than analyzing the full text sample.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a noninvasive approach to analyze neural activity patterns related to grasp type using EEG imaging and advanced classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding macroscopic neural activation patterns for grasp-type planning using noninvasive EEG instead of invasive recordings.

Method: A vision-based grasping platform was developed that separates planning and execution, employing EEG imaging, Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) for feature extraction, and support vector machine (SVM) classification for analyzing neural activity.

Result: Low-frequency oscillations were key to grasp-type discrimination (e.g., precision vs. power) with high classification accuracy, outperforming established methods like MRCP. Feature importance pinpointed brain networks involved during planning and execution phases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significance of low-frequency neural activity in planning grasp types using EEG-based analysis and offers novel insights into frontoparietal and motor network involvement during visuomotor tasks.

Abstract: The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with
cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings
have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type
planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We
introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate
grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across
large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates
grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic
visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)
technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features
within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated
binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs.
power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against
traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency
oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during
planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification
performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power
discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40
Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp
classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature
importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within
frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution.
This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp
type during planning using noninvasive EEG.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new problem called Online Two-Stage Submodular Maximization (O2SSM) and proposes a sublinear regret algorithm tailored to weighted threshold potential functions, validated both theoretically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Two-Stage Submodular Maximization (2SSM) for selecting subsets under online-revealed objectives, especially within the context of monotone submodular functions such as influence maximization and facility location.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm for O2SSM that guarantees sublinear regret: achieving $(1 - 1/e)^2$-regret under general matroid constraints and a better $(1 - 1/e)(1-e^{-k}k^k/k!)$-regret for uniform matroids of rank $k$.

Result: The algorithm achieves state-of-the-art theoretical bounds and shows promising results when tested experimentally using real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively addresses the O2SSM problem, offers superior theoretical regret bounds, and demonstrates empirical success, contributing significantly to the fields of online optimization and submodular function maximization.

Abstract: Given a collection of monotone submodular functions, the goal of Two-Stage
Submodular Maximization (2SSM) [Balkanski et al., 2016] is to restrict the
ground set so an objective selected u.a.r. from the collection attains a high
maximal value, on average, when optimized over the restricted ground set. We
introduce the Online Two-Stage Submodular Maximization (O2SSM) problem, in
which the submodular objectives are revealed in an online fashion. We study
this problem for weighted threshold potential functions, a large and important
subclass of monotone submodular functions that includes influence maximization,
data summarization, and facility location, to name a few. We design an
algorithm that achieves sublinear $(1 - 1/e)^2$-regret under general matroid
constraints and $(1 - 1/e)(1-e^{-k}k^k/k!)$-regret in the case of uniform
matroids of rank $k$; the latter also yields a state-of-the-art bound for the
(offline) 2SSM problem. We empirically validate the performance of our online
algorithm with experiments on real datasets.

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning model to analyze and predict noisy multicellular dynamics using graph neural networks and other methods, achieving high accuracy with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding noisy multicellular dynamics is essential for biological processes like wound healing and morphogenesis, but these dynamics are difficult to predict accurately.

Method: The paper introduces a biomimetic machine learning framework that uses graph neural networks, normalizing flows, and WaveNet algorithms to model tissues as neural stochastic differential equations based on evolving graph structures.

Result: The model successfully predicts stochastic cell motion, cell cycle state evolution, and accurately replicates experimental dynamics such as fly wing development and stochastic ERK wave signaling.

Conclusion: This framework provides a new, efficient method for modeling tissue dynamics and has potential applications in bioengineering and clinical fields as digital simulations of biological processes.

Abstract: Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from
wound healing to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are
notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning
framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from
experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks,
normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural
stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph.
This machine learning architecture reflects the architecture of the underlying
biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed to train
it compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking
epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only
captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states
in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately
generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly
wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the
way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.

Result: SBAN enables cross-representation learning, semantic software understanding, security analytics, and scalable training for LLMs, like transformers.

Conclusion: SBAN improves software code mining with LLMs, enhances security analysis, and broadens opportunities in automated reasoning about code across representations.

Abstract: This paper introduces SBAN (Source code, Binary, Assembly, and Natural
Language Description), a large-scale, multi-dimensional dataset designed to
advance the pre-training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for
software code analysis. SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including
2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across
four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language
descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables
research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software,
and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports
broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software
mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for
scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM
architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level
human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent

Conclusion: Machine learning-assisted approaches can outperform state-of-the-art classical techniques in combinatorial optimization problems, providing significant advancements.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical
applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and
quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted
approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed
simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the
challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising
spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates
standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show
that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance.
Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we
demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of
Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population
Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size
without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the
first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization
method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in
a combinatorial optimization setting.

### [395] [Transformers are Inherently Succinct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19315)
*Pascal Bergsträßer,Ryan Cotterell,Anthony W. Lin*

Main category: cs.FL

TL;DR: The paper examines the expressive power and succinctness of transformers, demonstrating their ability to represent formal languages more concisely than traditional methods like finite automata and LTL formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the expressive capabilities of transformers, specifically their ability to succinctly encode concepts and compare it to traditional formal language representations.

Method: The study involves theoretical analysis of the representational and verification capabilities of transformers, including proofs related to expressivity and computational complexity.

Result: Transformers are found to be highly expressive and capable of succinctly representing formal languages. However, verifying transformer properties is computationally intractable (EXPSPACE-complete).

Conclusion: While transformers excel in expressively encoding concepts, their complexity makes verification of their properties challenging.

Abstract: We propose succinctness as a measure of the expressive power of a transformer
in describing a concept. To this end, we prove that transformers are highly
expressive in that they can represent formal languages substantially more
succinctly than standard representations of formal languages like finite
automata and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. As a by-product of this
expressivity, we show that verifying properties of transformers is provably
intractable (i.e. EXPSPACE-complete).

*Yuxing Fei,Matthew J. McDermott,Christopher L. Rom,Shilong Wang,Gerbrand Ceder*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Dara,' an automated framework for analyzing complex powder XRD data, enhancing accuracy and reducing manual effort in phase identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of manual and expertise-intensive interpretation of powder XRD patterns, particularly in multiphase materials, which can lead to misinterpretation and errors.

Method: The proposed method, Dara, uses a data-driven approach. It performs exhaustive tree searches for phase combinations within a chemical space, employs robust Rietveld refinement (BGMN), structural database filtering, automatic clustering of isostructural phases, and uses peak-matching for scoring.

Result: Dara demonstrates the ability to reliably identify and refine multiple phases of complex XRD data and to handle ambiguities by generating multiple hypotheses for expert assessment or further characterization.

Conclusion: Dara automates and improves the reliability of XRD phase identification. Its integration into broader characterization workflows supports scalable and autonomous materials discovery.

Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing
crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns,
particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding
task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information,
multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to
potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease
humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven
Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust
identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara
performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within
a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld
refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering,
automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion,
peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When
ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided
between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing
the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable
analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for
integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully
self-driving materials discovery.

*Danial Ebrahimzadeh,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Mike Banad*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: SyntheFormer is a framework designed to predict the synthesizability of hypothetical inorganic crystals, achieving high precision in identifying promising materials for synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to fast-track materials discovery by predicting experimental realizability of hypothetical inorganic crystals, addressing limitations of relying solely on thermodynamic stability metrics.

Method: The paper introduces SyntheFormer, which incorporates Fourier-transformed crystal periodicity (FTCP), hierarchical feature extraction, Random-Forest feature selection, and a deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier. It is trained on historical data and tested on temporally separated future data.

Result: SyntheFormer achieves an AUC of 0.735 and a high-recall screening with 97.6% recall at 94.2% coverage in predicting synthesizable materials, outperforming the reliance on stability metrics.

Conclusion: SyntheFormer highlights the limitations of traditional stability-based predictions in materials synthesis and offers a promising, practical framework for prioritizing new inorganic materials for experimental synthesis.

Abstract: Predicting which hypothetical inorganic crystals can be experimentally
realized remains a central challenge in accelerating materials discovery.
SyntheFormer is a positive-unlabeled framework that learns synthesizability
directly from crystal structure, combining a Fourier-transformed crystal
periodicity (FTCP) representation with hierarchical feature extraction,
Random-Forest feature selection, and a compact deep MLP classifier. The model
is trained on historical data from 2011 through 2018 and evaluated
prospectively on future years from 2019 to 2025, where the positive class
constitutes only 1.02 per cent of samples. Under this temporally separated
evaluation, SyntheFormer achieves a test area under the ROC curve of 0.735 and,
with dual-threshold calibration, attains high-recall screening with 97.6 per
cent recall at 94.2 per cent coverage, which minimizes missed opportunities
while preserving discriminative power. Crucially, the model recovers
experimentally confirmed metastable compounds that lie far from the convex hull
and simultaneously assigns low scores to many thermodynamically stable yet
unsynthesized candidates, demonstrating that stability alone is insufficient to
predict experimental attainability. By aligning structure-aware representation
with uncertainty-aware decision rules, SyntheFormer provides a practical route
to prioritize synthesis targets and focus laboratory effort on the most
promising new inorganic materials.

*Hamed Jelodar,Samita Bai,Roozbeh Razavi-Far,Ali A. Ghorbani*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper presents FlexiDataGen, a framework utilizing large language models for generating domain-specific datasets in sensitive fields, addressing data availability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing challenges in accessing high-quality, annotated datasets in sensitive and high-stakes domains like healthcare and cybersecurity.

Method: FlexiDataGen integrates components like syntactic-semantic analysis, retrieval-augmented generation, dynamic element injection, and iterative paraphrasing to generate tailored datasets.

Result: The model efficiently generates semantically coherent and domain-specific datasets, alleviating data acquisition and annotation issues.

Conclusion: FlexiDataGen provides a scalable solution to enhance machine learning model development in sensitive and data-scarce fields by overcoming dataset limitations.

Abstract: Dataset availability and quality remain critical challenges in machine
learning, especially in domains where data are scarce, expensive to acquire, or
constrained by privacy regulations. Fields such as healthcare, biomedical
research, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs,
limited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events.
These issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the
development of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such
high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive
large language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset
generation in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich,
semantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to
specialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1)
syntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic
element injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation.
Together, these components ensure the generation of high-quality,
domain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively
alleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and
accurate machine learning model development.

*Veena Krishnaraj,Adrian E. Bayer,Christian Kragh Jespersen,Peter Melchior*

Main category: astro-ph.CO

TL;DR: The paper explores transfer learning in cosmological inference, using pre-training on $ \Lambda$CDM models to reduce simulation costs for beyond-$ \Lambda$CDM scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the high simulation costs of cosmological inference models by leveraging transfer learning techniques.

Method: The authors use pre-training on standard $ \Lambda$CDM cosmology models and fine-tune them for various extended scenarios, such as massive neutrinos and modified gravity.

Result: Pre-training reduces the need for simulations, but negative transfer can arise due to strong physical degeneracies between $ \Lambda$CDM and extended models.

Conclusion: While transfer learning has the potential to accelerate cosmological model inference, issues like negative transfer indicate careful architectural choices are crucial for success.

Abstract: Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically
requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models.
Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing
knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of
cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM
scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial
non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer
can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures,
finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our
findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model
approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also
hinder learning new physics.

### [400] [No Intelligence Without Statistics: The Invisible Backbone of Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19212)
*Ernest Fokoué*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper argues that the theoretical foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally statistical, encompassing nine pillars critical to AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight and emphasize the fundamental role of statistical principles in shaping and advancing AI and machine learning.

Method: The paper traces the statistical roots of nine key AI components and demonstrates their reliance on century-old statistical methods.

Result: It establishes a strong connection between statistical foundations and the core methodologies in AI, advocating for the recognition of this relationship.

Conclusion: AI's future robustness and trustworthiness depend on re-embracing its statistical foundation in education, research, and practice.

Abstract: The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) is often portrayed as a
revolution born from computer science and engineering. This narrative, however,
obscures a fundamental truth: the theoretical and methodological core of AI is,
and has always been, statistical. This paper systematically argues that the
field of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning
and modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference,
Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation
Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and
Unification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical
principles. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and
estimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of
clustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent
networks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an
unbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that
power modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical
frameworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer
science provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing
this statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary
step for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent
systems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to
re-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a
fragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There
is no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence
without statistical thought.

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in memory tiering caused by hotness fragmentation and introduces "address-space engineering" to dynamically reorganize virtual address spaces for better memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory tiering in datacenters fails to fully leverage its potential due to hotness fragmentation, which limits efficient memory reclamation despite skewed access patterns.

Method: The proposed approach, "address-space engineering," reorganizes virtual address spaces into hot and cold regions using a compiler-runtime system that tracks and migrates object access patterns.

Result: Experiments across ten data structures show up to 70% memory reduction with marginal performance overhead of 3%, proving the efficiency of the method.

Conclusion: Address space engineering enhances page-level tiering systems by reducing memory usage aggressively while maintaining optimal performance.

Abstract: Memory tiering in datacenters does not achieve its full potential due to
hotness fragmentation -- the intermingling of hot and cold objects within
memory pages. This fragmentation prevents page-based reclamation systems from
distinguishing truly hot pages from pages containing mostly cold objects,
fundamentally limiting memory efficiency despite highly skewed accesses. We
introduce address-space engineering: dynamically reorganizing application
virtual address spaces to create uniformly hot and cold regions that any
page-level tiering backend can manage effectively. HADES demonstrates this
frontend/backend approach through a compiler-runtime system that tracks and
migrates objects based on access patterns, requiring minimal developer
intervention. Evaluations across ten data structures achieve up to 70% memory
reduction with 3% performance overhead, showing that address space engineering
enables existing reclamation systems to reclaim memory aggressively without
performance degradation.

TL;DR: MIST, a molecular foundation model trained on comprehensive data, achieves state-of-the-art predictions across diverse chemical domains and introduces scalable approaches to accelerate materials innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper highlights the need for scalable computational models to efficiently explore chemical space for accelerating materials innovation, addressing shortcomings of existing methods.

Method: MIST employs a novel tokenization capturing nuclear, electronic, and geometric data, trains on diverse molecules, and introduces hyperparameter-penalized Bayesian neural scaling laws for efficient model development.

Result: MIST successfully predicts over 400 structure-property relationships, achieving or surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks in diverse fields such as physiology, electrochemistry, and quantum chemistry.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that MIST models can tackle complex real-world chemical problems, generalize scientific concepts, and significantly reduce computational costs in model creation, advancing materials discovery and design.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from
molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and
experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate
chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled
datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse
application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation
models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior
works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures
nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse
range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400
structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and
quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve
real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte
solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction,
stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and
multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using
mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends
not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn
generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized
Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of
model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented
here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery,
design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance
for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models.
