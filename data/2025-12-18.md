### [1] [Attention as Binding: A Vector-Symbolic Perspective on Transformer Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14709)
*Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores transformer models through Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA), revealing insights into reasoning failures and proposing improvements for robust and interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models show strong reasoning capabilities but are brittle in symbolic manipulations. The paper aims to address this by linking transformer mechanisms to Vector Symbolic Architectures.

Method: The paper interprets self-attention and residual streams using VSA, proposes biases in architecture, outlines training objectives for role-filler separation, and suggests metrics for assessing VSA-related properties.

Result: It connects transformer behaviors to chain-of-thought reasoning, memory augmentation, and symbolic reasoning failure modes, while proposing methods to enhance logical compositionality and reliability.

Conclusion: Viewing transformers as implementing soft vector-symbolic computations can lead to improved interpretability and consistency in reasoning systems, suggesting a path forward for robust AI development.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

### [2] [GR-Agent: Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent under Incomplete Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14766)
*Dongzhuoran Zhou,Yuqicheng Zhu,Xiaxia Wang,Hongkuan Zhou,Jiaoyan Chen,Steffen Staab,Yuan He,Evgeny Kharlamov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) by focusing on incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). They propose a benchmark methodology and introduce the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent), which improves reasoning over incomplete KGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets the unrealistic assumption in existing KGQA benchmarks that knowledge graphs are complete, ignoring the challenge posed by missing facts which demand reasoning and inference.

Method: They propose a methodology to construct benchmarks for incomplete KGs by removing direct triples but retaining alternative reasoning paths. Additionally, they introduce GR-Agent, an interactive environment-based framework to enhance KGQA by leveraging reasoning tools and maintaining memory of evidence.

Result: Experiments reveal that existing KGQA methods struggle under KG incompleteness, whereas GR-Agent demonstrates superior performance over baselines and comparable results to training-based approaches in both complete and incomplete environments.

Conclusion: The paper showcases a benchmark methodology and GR-Agent to address KG incompleteness in KGQA, improving reasoning capability and adaptability, marking progress in handling real-world KG challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

### [3] [IaC Generation with LLMs: An Error Taxonomy and A Study on Configuration Knowledge Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14792)
*Roman Nekrasov,Stefano Fossati,Indika Kumara,Damian Andrew Tamburri,Willem-Jan van den Heuvel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the low success rates of Language Models (LLMs) in generating intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and investigates methods to improve generation through structured knowledge injection, with significant success but limitations in nuanced user intent alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the poor performance of LLMs in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC), especially for Terraform, aiming to improve their functionality.

Method: The authors enhanced the IaC-Eval benchmark with cloud emulation and error analysis, introduced a new error taxonomy, and implemented knowledge injection techniques such as Naive and Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Result: Their approach improved the technical validation success rate from 27.1% to 75.3% and overall success from 27.1% to 62.6%, though intent alignment issues persisted.

Conclusion: While knowledge injection significantly improved the technical correctness of IaC code generation, LLMs still face challenges in achieving nuanced intent alignment, highlighting the gap between technical correctness and user intent fulfillment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

### [4] [AgroAskAI: A Multi-Agentic AI Framework for Supporting Smallholder Farmers' Enquiries Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14910)
*Nadine Angela Cantonjos,Arpita Biswas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces AgroAskAI, a multi-agent AI system designed to support climate adaptation decision-making in agriculture, particularly in rural communities. Leveraging modular, role-specialized agents, the system provides context-aware, actionable outputs while addressing issues like hallucinations and inclusivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate-related risks like droughts and heavy rainfall threaten rural agricultural regions, necessitating adaptive decision-making strategies. Conventional AI systems often lack dynamic reasoning and inclusivity, highlighting the need for innovative approaches.

Method: The paper develops AgroAskAI, a modular multi-agent AI architecture that employs a chain-of-responsibility coordination method. It integrates real-time tools, datasets, governance mechanisms, and multilingual interactions to ensure coherent, actionable outputs.

Result: AgroAskAI demonstrates improvements in delivering actionable and inclusive solutions to climate adaptation queries through experimental tests. Enhanced modularity, prompt refinement, and governance mechanisms contribute to its contextual and grounded outputs.

Conclusion: AgroAskAI showcases the capabilities of agentic AI in providing accountable, inclusive, and sustainable decision-making support for climate adaptation in agriculture, particularly for vulnerable rural communities.

Abstract: Agricultural regions in rural areas face damage from climate-related risks, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and shifting weather patterns. Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.

### [5] [Beyond Accuracy: A Geometric Stability Analysis of Large Language Models in Chess Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15033)
*Xidan Song,Weiqi Wang,Ruifeng Cao,Qingya Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques standard accuracy metrics in evaluating LLMs' reasoning in chess, proposing a Geometric Stability Framework to assess consistency under transformations. Results show disparities in models' stability despite high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methodologies to evaluate LLM reasoning rely too heavily on accuracy metrics, which fail to differentiate true conceptual reasoning from superficial memorization, particularly in complex geometric domains like chess.

Method: A Geometric Stability Framework was developed to evaluate six LLMs by testing consistency under invariant transformations such as board rotation, mirror symmetry, and color inversion using 3,000 chess positions.

Result: GPT-5.1 showed strong accuracy but unstable performance under geometric transformations, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo exhibited high robustness across all transformation types. Gemini 2.5 Flash excelled in rejecting illegal states.

Conclusion: Geometric stability is a critical metric for AI model evaluation, providing insights into reasoning capabilities and addressing issues in data contamination and overfitting. It highlights the need for orthogonal techniques beyond scalar accuracy.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles. In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.

### [6] [LADY: Linear Attention for Autonomous Driving Efficiency without Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15038)
*Jihao Huang,Xi Xia,Zhiyuan Li,Tianle Liu,Jingke Wang,Junbo Chen,Tengju Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LADY introduces an efficient generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving, utilizing linear attention mechanisms for effective spatiotemporal modeling and cross-modal data fusion with constant computation and memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving demands efficient temporal modeling, but current transformer-based methods are resource-intensive due to their quadratic attention costs, limiting deployment on edge systems.

Method: LADY uses linear attention mechanisms for constant-time and memory complexity while introducing lightweight linear cross-attention for flexible cross-modal and temporal data fusion.

Result: LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks with reduced computational cost and improved planning capabilities, validated on edge devices.

Conclusion: LADY demonstrates practical deployment feasibility in resource-limited scenarios with efficient computation and memory use, paving the way for advanced autonomous driving solutions.

Abstract: End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.

Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.

*Jinwu Hu,Dongjin Yang,Langyu Bian,Zhiquan Wen,Yufeng Wang,Yaofo Chen,Bin Xiao,Yuanqing Li,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogER is a framework for large language models that mimics human hierarchical reasoning, enhancing reasoning efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting suitable strategies for queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across tasks of varying difficulties, primarily depending on fixed reasoning strategies.

Method: CogER dynamically assesses query complexity and selects reasoning levels using a Markov Decision Process with reinforcement learning, integrating Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning for tasks requiring external tools.

Result: CogER achieved significant improvements in performance, with a 13% better average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% improvement on Out-of-Domain tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CogER demonstrates the potential of cognitive-inspired dynamic reasoning to enhance the adaptability and performance of large language models on diverse language tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

### [9] [A Clustering-Based Variable Ordering Framework for Relaxed Decision Diagrams for Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15198)
*Mohsen Nafar,Michael Römer,Lin Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a clustering-based framework for variable ordering in Relaxed Decision Diagrams to improve computational efficiency in Discrete Optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic variable ordering heuristics improve bounds in DO, but their global evaluations incur computational overhead, necessitating a more refined approach.

Method: The framework partitions variables into clusters and applies targeted ordering strategies such as Cluster-to-Cluster and Pick-and-Sort, while optimizing the cluster count dynamically.

Result: Embedding the framework into branch-and-bound algorithms for MWISP showed reduced computational costs compared to standard dynamic ordering baselines.

Conclusion: The clustering-based variable ordering approach enhances efficiency and tightens bounds in DO algorithms without compromising computational feasibility.

Abstract: Efficient exact algorithms for Discrete Optimization (DO) rely heavily on strong primal and dual bounds. Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.

*Zhengchao Chen,Haoran Wang,Jing Yao,Pedram Ghamisi,Jun Zhou,Peter M. Atkinson,Bing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified framework for automated Earth observation workflows, featuring expert-guided planning and adaptive, learning mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing task-specific automated systems in processing diverse remote sensing datasets efficiently and reliably, thereby addressing the need for a unified and scalable framework.

Method: The proposed method includes the integration of a Procedural Knowledge Base, Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and Evolutionary Memory Module to create a unified system capable of guided planning, autonomous error recovery, and continuous learning.

Result: CangLing-KnowFlow outperformed the Reflexion baseline by 4% in Task Success Rate in evaluations involving 13 large language models over diverse, complex workflows.

Conclusion: CangLing-KnowFlow shows strong potential as a robust, adaptive, and scalable framework for automating complex Earth observation workflows, leveraging expert knowledge and adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: The automated and intelligent processing of massive remote sensing (RS) datasets is critical in Earth observation (EO). Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).

*Toshihide Ubukata,Enhong Mu,Takuto Yamauchi,Mingyue Zhang,Jialong Li,Kenji Tei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GCRL, a reinforcement learning-based method that improves controller synthesis by using Graph Neural Networks to better encode exploration history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controller synthesis efficiency relies on exploration policies, which are often limited by fixed rules or simplistic RL methods that focus on current features.

Method: The authors introduce GCRL, a method that incorporates Graph Neural Networks to encode Labeled Transition System exploration as a graph, including richer contextual history.

Result: GCRL outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in four out of five benchmark domains, except one with high symmetry and localized interactions.

Conclusion: Graph Neural Networks can enhance RL-based controller synthesis by providing richer exploration contexts, improving efficiency and generalization in most scenarios.

Abstract: Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

*Seok-Hyun Ga,Chun-Yen Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how Generative AI, specifically state-of-the-art LLMs, performs on multimodal scientific reasoning tasks, revealing cognitive limitations and proposing ways to design AI-resistant assessment questions in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing use of AI in student assignments, raising concerns over academic integrity and the efficacy of traditional assessments.

Method: The researchers analyzed multimodal reasoning capabilities of LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro) on Earth Science I questions from Korea's CSAT, using three testing conditions (full-page input, individual item input, optimized multimodal input). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted.

Result: The LLMs showed performance issues with unstructured inputs and fundamental reasoning flaws even under optimized conditions. Key findings include perception errors, process hallucination, and an inability to connect calculations with scientific concepts.

Conclusion: The findings highlight cognitive gaps in LLMs and propose designing AI-resistant evaluation methods to ensure fairness and combat unauthorized AI use in educational settings.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

*Zehua Pei,Hui-Ling Zhen,Shixiong Kai,Sinno Jialin Pan,Yunhe Wang,Mingxuan Yuan,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPE, a system for improving large language models by optimizing their prompts using an online optimization approach, showing substantial improvement in task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in current LLM agents to manage and adapt to large, dynamic contexts, which leads to failures in corrective and enhancement activities.

Method: The researchers propose SCOPE, which evolves agent prompts through a Dual-Stream mechanism (balancing tactical and strategic adjustments) and Perspective-Driven Exploration for broader strategy coverage.

Result: SCOPE significantly improves task success rates, elevating performance on tests from 14.23% to 38.64% without requiring human intervention.

Conclusion: SCOPE demonstrates that self-evolving prompt optimization can greatly enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents. The introduced approach offers a promising avenue for future advancements in adaptive and autonomous reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention.

*Stefan Edelkamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework leveraging AI self-play to improve decision-making in multi-player card games by expanding a human game database with AI-generated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in early-stage decision-making in multi-player card games where computational approaches rely heavily on human game statistics.

Method: The authors propose a bootstrapping outer-learning framework paired with feature hash functions, enabling a card game engine to self-learn from millions of AI self-play games and infer new knowledge.

Result: The framework improved prediction accuracy and automated decision-making, demonstrated through a case study in the card game Skat.

Conclusion: This method introduces a viable automated approach for enhancing gameplay decisions in multi-player card games using AI-driven self-learning based on both human and AI-generated data.

Abstract: In multi-player card games such as Skat or Bridge, the early stages of the game, such as bidding, game selection, and initial card selection, are often more critical to the success of the play than refined middle- and end-game play. At the current limits of computation, such early decision-making resorts to using statistical information derived from a large corpus of human expert games. In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics. We implement perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, producing a self-improving card game engine, where newly inferred knowledge is continuously improved during self-learning. The case study in Skat shows that the automated approach can be used to support various decisions in the game.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrated system combining Answer Set Programming (ASP) and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for efficient and explainable scheduling in vertiports within Urban Air Mobility (UAM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing focus on efficient vertiport scheduling in UAM due to constrained resources, particularly addressing dynamic operational needs and ambiguous human rescheduling requests.

Method: The approach used involves employing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for scheduling, utilizing three-valued logic to interpret ambiguous user intents, and developing a system that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with MILP and decision trees.

Result: The integrated system provides an optimized and explainable scheduling framework for UAM, capable of addressing dynamic and unclear human inputs effectively.

Conclusion: This work presents a robust and adaptive scheduling framework for Urban Air Mobility, enhancing the transparency and efficiency of human-centric scheduling processes.

Abstract: Due to the restricted resources, efficient scheduling in vertiports has received much more attention in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). For the scheduling problem, we utilize a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is often formulated in a resource-restricted project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we show our approach to handle both dynamic operation requirements and vague rescheduling requests from humans. Particularly, we utilize a three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and a decision tree, proposing a newly integrated system that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and MILP. This integrated framework optimizes schedules and supports human inputs transparently. With this system, we provide a robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nemotron-Math, a mathematical reasoning dataset with diverse reasoning styles and tool integration, providing improved problem-solving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mathematical reasoning datasets have limitations in diversity, reasoning style, long-form traces, and tool integrations, creating a need for a more comprehensive dataset.

Method: The authors create Nemotron-Math, using gpt-oss-120b for multi-mode generation to develop 7.5M solution traces. This integrates datasets such as AoPS and StackExchange-Math, alongside a fine-tuning strategy to enhance performance.

Result: Nemotron-Math achieves superior results compared to OpenMathReasoning, improves generalization through StackExchange-Math data integration, supports long-context fine-tuning, and achieves leading benchmarks like 100% maj@16 accuracy on AIME tasks.

Conclusion: Nemotron-Math establishes a new state-of-the-art for mathematical reasoning datasets by offering diverse features and achieving high performance across various benchmarks.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical reasoning supervision requires diverse reasoning styles, long-form traces, and effective tool integration, capabilities that existing datasets provide only in limited form. Leveraging the multi-mode generation ability of gpt-oss-120b, we introduce Nemotron-Math, a large-scale mathematical reasoning dataset containing 7.5M solution traces across high, medium, and low reasoning modes, each available both with and without Python tool-integrated reasoning (TIR).
  The dataset integrates 85K curated AoPS problems with 262K community-sourced StackExchange-Math problems, combining structured competition tasks with diverse real-world mathematical queries. We conduct controlled evaluations to assess the dataset quality.
  Nemotron-Math consistently outperforms the original OpenMathReasoning on matched AoPS problems. Incorporating StackExchange-Math substantially improves robustness and generalization, especially on HLE-Math, while preserving accuracy on math competition benchmarks.
  To support efficient long-context training, we develop a sequential bucketed strategy that accelerates 128K context-length fine-tuning by 2--3$\times$ without significant accuracy loss. Overall, Nemotron-Math enables state-of-the-art performance, including 100\% maj@16 accuracy on AIME 2024 and 2025 with Python TIR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark evaluating large language models (LLMs) on scientific discovery tasks, revealing a gap between their capabilities and general science benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs in real-world scientific discovery settings, capturing their ability to generate hypotheses, design tests, and interpret results—tasks overlooked by traditional benchmarks.

Method: A two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework assessing LLMs on modular research scenarios and comprehensive project-level tasks across disciplines like biology and physics.

Result: SDE framework reveals consistent gaps in LLM performance on scientific tasks, diminishing returns in scaling models, and shared weaknesses among top-tier LLMs, though some promise is demonstrated.

Conclusion: LLMs, while not close to scientific superintelligence, show potential in aiding discovery. The SDE framework provides a reproducible way to benchmark and guide the development of LLMs for scientific research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

### [19] [A Decision-Theoretic Approach for Managing Misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15584)
*Daniel A. Herrmann,Abinav Chari,Isabelle Qian,Sree Sharvesh,B. A. Levinstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to decide when AI systems can be trusted to make decisions despite imperfect alignment, based on balancing alignment, epistemic accuracy, and operational reach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding the uncertainty in delegating decisions to AI, particularly the trade-offs between alignment, accuracy, and reach of the AI system.

Method: A decision-theoretic framework is introduced, quantifying the tradeoffs involved and offering a scoring system to evaluate rational delegation.

Result: The analysis shows that universal delegation requires near-perfect alignment, while context-specific delegation can be rational even with misalignment due to improved decision problems from the agent's capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper shifts focus from achieving perfect alignment to evaluating contextual delegation risks and benefits, providing a method to assess whether AI is sufficiently aligned for specific tasks.

Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

*Jiaqi Xu,Cuiling Lan,Xuejin Chen,Yan LU*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Stepwise Think-Critique (STC) framework, which interleaves reasoning and self-critiquing directly within large language models (LLMs) to improve critical thinking capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current LLMs that often separate reasoning from verification, thereby failing to achieve synchronized and consistent learning akin to human critical thinking.

Method: The authors propose the STC framework, combining reasoning and self-critique at each reasoning step within the same model, trained with hybrid reinforcement learning using reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards.

Result: STC showcases enhanced critical thinking and produces more interpretable and robust reasoning results, as demonstrated on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The STC framework represents progress towards LLMs with integrated critical thinking, reducing reliance on external verification systems and enabling unified reasoning and evaluation.

Abstract: Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

### [21] [Explaining the Reasoning of Large Language Models Using Attribution Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15663)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAGE framework enhances attribution explanations in LLMs by introducing directed graphs capturing inter-generational influences, achieving 40% improvement in faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of LLM reasoning raises concerns for safety and trust. Current attribution methods inadequately explain the inter-generational influence in autoregressive LLMs.

Method: The paper proposes the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework, utilizing a directed attribution graph incorporating causality and row stochasticity properties.

Result: CAGE provides improved context attribution faithfulness across various models, datasets, metrics, and methods, with gains up to 40%.

Conclusion: CAGE effectively captures inter-generational influences to enhance explanation accuracy for autoregressive LLMs, addressing limitations in existing attribution methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

### [23] [Predictive Concept Decoders: Training Scalable End-to-End Interpretability Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15712)
*Vincent Huang,Dami Choi,Daniel D. Johnson,Sarah Schwettmann,Jacob Steinhardt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end approach to train interpretability assistants to make neural network activations interpretable by predicting behavior via a communication bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for interpreting neural network activations rely on hand-engineered approaches which lack scalability and adaptability.

Method: The authors introduce a Predictive Concept Decoder (PCD) where an encoder compresses activations into sparse concepts, and a decoder reads and answers natural language questions. This assistant is pretrained on large datasets and finetuned for specific tasks.

Result: The approach demonstrates scalability, improving interpretability scores and performance on downstream tasks, such as detecting jailbreaks, latent concepts, and user attributes.

Conclusion: The proposed PCD architecture effectively bridges the gap in scalable interpretability, producing meaningful explanations of neural network behaviors.

Abstract: Interpreting the internal activations of neural networks can produce more faithful explanations of their behavior, but is difficult due to the complex structure of activation space. Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-end training objective, by training interpretability assistants to accurately predict model behavior from activations through a communication bottleneck. Specifically, an encoder compresses activations to a sparse list of concepts, and a decoder reads this list and answers a natural language question about the model. We show how to pretrain this assistant on large unstructured data, then finetune it to answer questions. The resulting architecture, which we call a Predictive Concept Decoder, enjoys favorable scaling properties: the auto-interp score of the bottleneck concepts improves with data, as does the performance on downstream applications. Specifically, PCDs can detect jailbreaks, secret hints, and implanted latent concepts, and are able to accurately surface latent user attributes.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates hardware costs of thermometer encoding in weightless neural networks and presents a hardware generator addressing this concern.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining the hardware cost associated with thermometer encoding in differential weightless neural networks for efficient FPGA acceleration.

Method: Introduced a DWN hardware generator with explicit thermometer encoding. Experimentally tested its impact on LUT usage in FPGA implementation for Jet Substructure Classification task.

Result: Thermometer encoding increased LUT usage by up to 3.20×, particularly affecting small network costs.

Conclusion: Thermometer encoding dominates hardware costs in DWNs, emphasizing the necessity of encoding-aware hardware designs for efficient neural network accelerators.

Abstract: Fully parallel neural network accelerators on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer high throughput for latency-critical applications but face hardware resource constraints. Weightless neural networks (WNNs) efficiently replace arithmetic with logic-based inference. Differential weightless neural networks (DWN) further optimize resource usage by learning connections between encoders and LUT layers via gradient-based training. However, DWNs rely on thermometer encoding, and the associated hardware cost has not been fully evaluated. We present a DWN hardware generator that includes thermometer encoding explicitly. Experiments on the Jet Substructure Classification (JSC) task show that encoding can increase LUT usage by up to 3.20$\times$, dominating costs in small networks and highlighting the need for encoding-aware hardware design in DWN accelerators.

*Zhihan Xu,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor K. Prasanna*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper introduces an FPGA-based accelerator, FAME, that significantly improves the efficiency of homomorphic encrypted matrix multiplication (HE MM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of HE MM, which hinders privacy-preserving data computation in applications like machine learning.

Method: Design a novel datapath for Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT) to enhance memory efficiency and reduce bottlenecks. Implement the FPGA accelerator, FAME, optimized for matrix multiplication with configurable HE parameters.

Result: FAME achieves 221x average speedup compared to CPU implementations, improving scalability and practicality for large-scale HE MM.

Conclusion: The proposed FAME accelerator overcomes computational and memory barriers in encrypted matrix multiplication, making privacy-preserving applications more feasible.

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, addressing privacy concerns in cloud computing. However, the high computational cost of HE operations, particularly matrix multiplication (MM), remains a major barrier to its practical deployment. Accelerating homomorphic encrypted MM (HE MM) is therefore crucial for applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning.
  In this paper, we present a bandwidth-efficient FPGA implementation of HE MM. We first develop a cost model to evaluate the on-chip memory requirements for a given set of HE parameters and input matrix sizes. Our analysis shows that optimizing on-chip memory usage is critical for scalable and efficient HE MM. To this end, we design a novel datapath for Homomorphic Linear Transformation (HLT), the primary bottleneck in HE MM. The proposed datapath significantly reduces off-chip memory traffic and on-chip memory demand by enabling fine-grained data reuse. Leveraging this datapath, we introduce FAME, the first FPGA-based accelerator specifically tailored for HE MM. FAME supports arbitrary matrix shapes and is configurable across a wide range of HE parameter sets. We implement FAME on an Alveo U280 FPGA and evaluate its performance across diverse matrix sizes and shapes. Experimental results show that FAME achieves an average speedup of 221x over state-of-the-art CPU-based implementations, demonstrating its scalability and practicality for large-scale consecutive HE MM and real-world workloads.

*Richard Ackermann,Simeon Emanuilov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hallucinations in large language models are intrinsic to their architecture, not just a result of misaligned incentives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the view that hallucinations in transformer models arise due to optimization failures and misaligned rewards, presenting an alternative interpretation based on structural limitations.

Method: Empirical experiments with a Licensing Oracle and theoretical examinations of transformer embedding spaces to investigate hallucination origins.

Result: Findings show hallucinations stem from architectural necessity and require external truth-validation mechanisms for elimination.

Conclusion: Hallucinations are a structural issue in generative models, necessitating hybrid systems with grounding modules to ensure epistemic reliability.

Abstract: OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.
  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.
  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.

TL;DR: The paper introduces T5Gemma 2, an advanced lightweight encoder-decoder model with enhanced multilingual, multimodal, and long-context capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a model with enhanced capabilities for multilingual, multimodal, and long-context tasks while optimizing efficiency and improving over previous architectures.

Method: The method involves adapting pretrained decoder-only models into encoder-decoder models using UL2, extending it to multimodal tasks via Gemma 3, and improving efficiency through shared embeddings and unified attention mechanisms.

Result: T5Gemma 2 demonstrates general adaptability across modalities and architectures, excels in long-context tasks, matches or improves pretraining performance, and significantly outperforms its multimodal predecessor (Gemma 3) post-training.

Conclusion: T5Gemma 2 is a significant advancement in lightweight encoder-decoder models for multilingual and multimodal contexts; it is efficient, strong in long-context capabilities, and publicly available for further research.

Abstract: We introduce T5Gemma 2, the next generation of the T5Gemma family of lightweight open encoder-decoder models, featuring strong multilingual, multimodal and long-context capabilities. T5Gemma 2 follows the adaptation recipe (via UL2) in T5Gemma -- adapting a pretrained decoder-only model into an encoder-decoder model, and extends it from text-only regime to multimodal based on the Gemma 3 models. We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling. Similar to T5Gemma, T5Gemma 2 yields comparable or better pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training performance than its Gemma 3 counterpart. We release the pretrained models (270M-270M, 1B-1B and 4B-4B) to the community for future research.

TL;DR: The paper enhances a news viewpoint classification pipeline by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating semantic actor descriptions—achieving improved performance, especially in analyzing long inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and assess media balance and fairness in shaping public and political discourses through topic-based and viewpoint-driven analysis in the context of public debate.

Method: The authors improved a previously introduced hybrid human-machine pipeline by fine-tuning LLMs for viewpoint classification and enriching claim representations using semantic actor information from Wikidata.

Result: The improved pipeline demonstrated enhanced classification performance, outperforming alternative solutions, with integrated LLMs and enriched claim descriptions showing the best results, especially for long inputs.

Conclusion: Integrating fine-tuned LLMs with enriched semantic claim representations enhances the ability to classify news viewpoints, offering a more sophisticated tool to analyze media narratives and public discourse dynamics.

Abstract: News sources play a central role in democratic societies by shaping political and social discourse through specific topics, viewpoints and voices. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) on pharmacy licensure questions and introduces a method called DrugRAG to improve accuracy through external knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving LLM accuracy in pharmacy licensure question-answering tasks using evidence-based drug knowledge.

Method: The authors benchmarked 11 LLMs using a 141-question pharmacy dataset and implemented DrugRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that integrates structured drug information into model prompts externally.

Result: Baseline LLM accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with improved accuracy of 7 to 21 percentage points using DrugRAG across all models.

Conclusion: DrugRAG enhances pharmacy-related LLM performance by integrating external evidence-based knowledge without altering model architecture, making it a practical tool for AI-assisted pharmacy applications.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate large language model (LLM) performance on pharmacy licensure-style question-answering (QA) tasks and develop an external knowledge integration method to improve their accuracy.
  Methods: We benchmarked eleven existing LLMs with varying parameter sizes (8 billion to 70+ billion) using a 141-question pharmacy dataset. We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters.
  Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models. This approach provides a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications with evidence-based information.

### [30] [Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA): A Game Theoretic and Optimization Driven Approach to Efficient Contextual Modeling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14925)
*Caner Erden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAHA to address quadratic complexity in self-attention for Large Language Models, achieving better scalability and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up Large Language Models for long-context tasks is hindered by the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms, which fail to efficiently capture global dependencies or multiscale semantic granularity.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical decomposition approach called MAHA, which uses learnable downsampling operators and a novel aggregation strategy formulated as either a convex optimization problem or a game-theoretic Nash equilibrium for optimal scale fusion.

Result: MAHA reduces computational costs by 81% at sequence lengths of 4096, demonstrated via empirical FLOPs analysis, while maintaining effective representation of both local nuances and global context.

Conclusion: MAHA successfully bridges optimization theory with sequence modeling, providing a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation LLMs that balances computational efficiency with semantic fidelity.

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs.

*George-Andrei Dima,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tackles the low-resource language gap by creating Romanian multimodal NLP resources and fine-tuning visual language models (VLMs) for Romanian visual question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of multimodal NLP datasets and tools for low-resource languages like Romanian, contributing to more inclusive generative AI models.

Method: The authors translate the Flickr30k dataset into Romanian, extend it with visual question answering data, and fine-tune widely used open-source VLMs (LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, Qwen2) using the LoRA method.

Result: The fine-tuned models exhibit improvements in Romanian visual question answering and other tasks such as image captioning, with significant gains in BERTScore F1 and reduced grammatical errors.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential for fine-tuning existing models to improve NLP capabilities in low-resource languages, advancing both language understanding and fluency for Romanian.

Abstract: Focusing on low-resource languages is an essential step toward democratizing generative AI. In this work, we contribute to reducing the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian. We translate the widely known Flickr30k dataset into Romanian and further extend it for visual question answering by leveraging open-source LLMs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our datasets by fine-tuning open-source VLMs on Romanian visual question answering. We select VLMs from three widely used model families: LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, and Qwen2. For fine-tuning, we employ the parameter-efficient LoRA method. Our models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA, as well as on tasks they were not trained on, such as Romanian image description generation. The seven-billion-parameter Qwen2-VL-RoVQA obtains top scores on both tasks, with improvements of +6.05% and +2.61% in BERTScore F1 over its original version. Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.

### [32] [Cross-Tokenizer Likelihood Scoring Algorithms for Language Model Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14954)
*Buu Phan,Ashish Khisti,Karen Ullrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for aligning vocabularies between teacher and student language models with different tokenizers, enabling effective cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring and boosting distillation efficiency and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring for language model distillation, particularly when the teacher and student models use different tokenizers and vocabularies.

Method: The method leverages the recursive structure of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to create a probabilistic framework for likelihood scoring across mismatched tokenizers. It addresses both subset and general vocabulary scenarios.

Result: In subset vocabulary scenarios, the method reduces memory footprint by up to 12% while improving performance up to 4% in Qwen2.5-1.5B distillation. In general settings, it improves GSM8K accuracy by over 2% among state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively resolves vocabulary misalignment in LM distillation, yielding significant memory savings and performance improvements in both specialized and broad applications.

Abstract: Computing next-token likelihood ratios between two language models (LMs) is a standard task in training paradigms such as knowledge distillation. Since this requires both models to share the same probability space, it becomes challenging when the teacher and student LMs use different tokenizers, for instance, when edge-device deployment necessitates a smaller vocabulary size to lower memory overhead. In this work, we address this vocabulary misalignment problem by uncovering an implicit recursive structure in the commonly deployed Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm and utilizing it to create a probabilistic framework for cross-tokenizer likelihood scoring. Our method enables sequence likelihood evaluation for vocabularies different from the teacher model native tokenizer, addressing two specific scenarios: when the student vocabulary is a subset of the teacher vocabulary, and the general case where it is arbitrary. In the subset regime, our framework computes exact likelihoods and provides next-token probabilities for sequential sampling with only O(1) model evaluations per token. When used for distillation, this yields up to a 12% reduction in memory footprint for the Qwen2.5-1.5B model while also improving baseline performance up to 4% on the evaluated tasks. For the general case, we introduce a rigorous lossless procedure that leverages BPE recursive structure, complemented by a fast approximation that keeps large-vocabulary settings practical. Applied to distillation for mathematical reasoning, our approach improves GSM8K accuracy by more than 2% over the current state of the art.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 40 multimodal language models (MLLMs) on chemistry Olympiad questions, finding significant challenges in modality fusion and offering strategies to improve reasoning and grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges LLMs face with scientific reasoning in chemistry, where interpreting both visual and textual data is critical.

Method: The paper evaluates 40 proprietary and open-source MLLMs using a curated benchmark of USNCO-style questions, along with ablation studies and interpretability techniques to assess performance.

Result: Many models struggle with integrating vision and language, with some performing better when images are excluded. Chain-of-Thought prompting improves accuracy and grounding.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations in current MLLMs for domain-specific reasoning and emphasizes the need for further advancements to create better-integrated multimodal AI systems for scientific applications.

Abstract: Multimodal scientific reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in chemistry, where problem-solving relies on symbolic diagrams, molecular structures, and structured visual data. Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in segmenting topics in maritime VHF dialogues, which involve informal and implicit communication, by introducing an effective and interpretable method.

Method: The DASH-DTS framework is built on LLMs and introduces techniques like dialogue handshake recognition for topic shift detection, similarity-based contextual enhancement, and selective sample generation for model robustness.

Result: The DASH-DTS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly introduced VHF-Dial dataset and standard benchmarks, with enhanced interpretability and reliability.

Conclusion: DASH-DTS shows strong potential for improving operational dialogue understanding, offering accurate segmentation and stable monitoring tools for maritime communication scenarios.

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) is crucial for understanding task-oriented public-channel communications, such as maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit transitions. To address the limitations of traditional methods, we propose DASH-DTS, a novel LLM-based framework. Its core contributions are: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition; (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection; and (3) the generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve model discrimination and robustness. Additionally, we release VHF-Dial, the first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications, to advance research in this domain. DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.

*Hongbo Wang,MaungMaung AprilPyone,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called SGM to mitigate toxicity in multimodal large language models by targeting toxic neurons without updating parameters, significantly reducing harmful outputs while maintaining model fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models often inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals due to their pretraining data, posing safety risks, particularly when confronted with adversarial triggers.

Method: The proposed approach, SGM, recalibrates toxic expert neurons through expertise-weighted soft suppression at the neuron level without requiring parameter updates. This method serves as a safety intervention for toxicity control.

Result: The SGM method decreased harmful output rates from 48.2% to 2.5% under both standard and adversarial conditions in tested models, while still preserving multimodal reasoning and fluency.

Conclusion: SGM provides an interpretable, cost-effective, and extensible solution for addressing toxicity in multimodal generation systems. It can also be integrated with existing methods for enhanced safety.

Abstract: Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort.
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a formal framework called Meta-Prompting Protocol to make LLMs reliable, moving beyond heuristic prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current heuristic-based prompt engineering lacks reliability, hindering LLMs from being used in mission-critical applications.

Method: The approach uses Meta-Prompting Protocol with Adversarial Trinity (Generator, Auditor, Optimizer), semantic computation graphs, and textual critique gradients.

Result: The theoretical viability of the framework is showcased using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad).

Conclusion: The Meta-Prompting Protocol provides a foundation for observable software engineering in probabilistic computing systems.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPE, a framework addressing confirmation bias and sparse rewards in test-time reinforcement learning for LLMs, achieving superior results across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reasoning performance of large language models by tackling the limitations of majority voting strategy, such as confirmation bias and sparse rewards, in test-time reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose SCOPE, which incorporates step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation and dynamic subgroup partitioning for better reasoning quality and exploration diversity.

Result: SCOPE achieves substantial performance gains, with 13.1% improvement on AIME 2025 and 8.1% on AMC benchmarks, surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: SCOPE is an effective method for enhancing reasoning in LLMs by integrating confidence and subgroup partitioning, and is superior to recent baselines in experimental benchmarks.

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning mitigates the reliance on annotated data by using majority voting results as pseudo-labels, emerging as a complementary direction to reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1\% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1\% on AMC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety risks posed by emerging LLMs utilizing MCP for interactions with heterogeneous tools, which existing benchmarks fail to cover comprehensively.

Method: Developing MCP-SafetyBench, a benchmark that evaluates safety in multi-turn, multi-domain workflows, incorporating 20 attack types and requiring complex reasoning and coordination.

Result: Evaluated leading LLMs using MCP-SafetyBench, discovering disparities in safety performance and vulnerabilities increasing with task complexity and server interactions.

Conclusion: MCP-SafetyBench underscores the importance of improved defenses and serves as a critical tool for diagnosing and improving safety in MCP-based systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into agentic systems that reason, plan, and operate external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a key enabler of this transition, offering a standardized interface for connecting LLMs with heterogeneous tools and services. Yet MCP's openness and multi-server workflows introduce new safety risks that existing benchmarks fail to capture, as they focus on isolated attacks or lack real-world coverage. We present MCP-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark built on real MCP servers that supports realistic multi-turn evaluation across five domains: browser automation, financial analysis, location navigation, repository management, and web search. It incorporates a unified taxonomy of 20 MCP attack types spanning server, host, and user sides, and includes tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-server coordination under uncertainty. Using MCP-SafetyBench, we systematically evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, revealing large disparities in safety performance and escalating vulnerabilities as task horizons and server interactions grow. Our results highlight the urgent need for stronger defenses and establish MCP-SafetyBench as a foundation for diagnosing and mitigating safety risks in real-world MCP deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the 'Great Misalignment Problem' where traditional assessment methods are inadequate because students increasingly use tools like ChatGPT, requiring updated, process-focused evaluation systems.

Method: The authors propose the Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA) model, which adopts a process-based and multi-evidence approach, inspired by multi-factor authentication.

Result: The introduction of the P-MFA model is a response to the inadequacy of product-based evaluations, shifting focus toward assessing learning processes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by adopting P-MFA, educators can align assessment methods with modern challenges, ensuring validity in evaluating students' learning in the era of advanced generative tools.

Abstract: This paper explores the growing epistemic parallel between NLG evaluation and grading of students in a Finnish University. We argue that both domains are experiencing a Great Misalignment Problem. As students increasingly use tools like ChatGPT to produce sophisticated outputs, traditional assessment methods that focus on final products rather than learning processes have lost their validity. To address this, we introduce the Pedagogical Multi-Factor Assessment (P-MFA) model, a process-based, multi-evidence framework inspired by the logic of multi-factor authentication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes RFKG-CoT to enhance knowledge-intensive QA in LLMs, achieving up to 14.7 pp accuracy improvement on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to improve the reliability of large language models in answering knowledge-intensive questions by addressing the issues of rigid reasoning step selection and underutilization of knowledge graph paths.

Method: The proposed RFKG-CoT integrates a relation-driven hop-count selector for adaptive reasoning and a few-shot in-context learning mechanism to guide comprehension through reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show up to 14.7 percentage point accuracy improvement over KG-CoT, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: RFKG-CoT effectively enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs, making them more accurate and reliable in knowledge-intensive QA tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct "brother" relations, 2-hop for indirect "father-son" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a "question-paths-answer" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.

The experiments explored various approaches, including fine-tuning pre-trained models like mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) and IndicBart (Dabre et al., 2021) in both multilingual and monolingual settings, LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) fine-tuning IndicTrans2 (Gala et al., 2023), zero-shot and few-shot prompting (Brown, 2020) with large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3 (Dubey et al., 2024) and Mixtral 8x7b (Jiang et al., 2024), LoRA supervised fine-tuning of Llama 3 (Mecklenburg et al., 2024), and training Transformer models (Vaswani, 2017) from scratch. The results were evaluated on the WMT23 Low-Resource Indic Language Translation Shared Task test data using SacreBLEU (Post, 2018) and CHRF (Popovic, 2015), highlighting the challenges of low-resource translation and the potential of LLMs for these tasks, particularly with fine-tuning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FAME, a multilingual synthetic benchmark for machine unlearning in LLMs, facilitating entity and instance-level unlearning across five languages using fictional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns raised by LLMs trained on web-scale data by enabling controlled evaluation of machine unlearning techniques without retraining.

Method: Developed FAME, a synthetic benchmark comprising 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs in five languages, supporting two unlearning scenarios: entity-level and instance-level.

Result: Provides systematic comparison methods for unlearning techniques across various languages, ensuring information control due to the synthetic nature of the dataset.

Conclusion: FAME enables advanced multilingual evaluation of unlearning methods, offering a structured synthetic dataset for enhanced privacy measures in LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs trained on web-scale data raise concerns about privacy and the right to be forgotten. To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset to analyze moral values in discourse, develops annotation methods for complex moralizations, evaluates language models' performance, and discusses challenges in detecting these persuasive arguments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore how moral values are strategically applied in argumentation, given that moralizations are an underexplored yet significant aspect of persuasive communication.

Method: The authors created a diverse dataset of German texts, developed a frame-based annotation scheme for identifying moralizations, and evaluated large language models under various prompting conditions.

Result: Detailed prompt instructions were found to be more effective than few-shot or explanation-based methods for detecting moralizations. The task remains highly subjective and dependent on context.

Conclusion: The study underscores the complexity of analyzing moralizations and advocates for interdisciplinary advancements in understanding moral discourse in NLP, providing data and tools to support further research.

Abstract: Moralizations - arguments that invoke moral values to justify demands or positions - are a yet underexplored form of persuasive communication. We present the Moralization Corpus, a novel multi-genre dataset designed to analyze how moral values are strategically used in argumentative discourse. Moralizations are pragmatically complex and often implicit, posing significant challenges for both human annotators and NLP systems. We develop a frame-based annotation scheme that captures the constitutive elements of moralizations - moral values, demands, and discourse protagonists - and apply it to a diverse set of German texts, including political debates, news articles, and online discussions. The corpus enables fine-grained analysis of moralizing language across communicative formats and domains. We further evaluate several large language models (LLMs) under varied prompting conditions for the task of moralization detection and moralization component extraction and compare it to human annotations in order to investigate the challenges of automatic and manual analysis of moralizations. Results show that detailed prompt instructions has a greater effect than few-shot or explanation-based prompting, and that moralization remains a highly subjective and context-sensitive task. We release all data, annotation guidelines, and code to foster future interdisciplinary research on moral discourse and moral reasoning in NLP.

Abstract: We introduce SynGP500, a clinician-curated collection of 500 synthetic Australian general practice medical notes. The dataset integrates curriculum-based clinical breadth (RACGP 2022 Curriculum), epidemiologically-calibrated prevalence (BEACH study), and diverse consultation contexts. This approach systematically includes both common presentations and less-common curriculum-specified conditions that GPs must recognize but appear infrequently in single practice populations, potentially supporting more generalizable model training than datasets constrained by naturally occurring case distributions. SynGP500 is messy by design, reflecting the authentic complexity of healthcare delivery: telegraphic documentation, typos, patient non-adherence, socioeconomic barriers, and clinician-patient disagreements, unlike sanitized synthetic datasets that obscure clinical realities. Multi-faceted validation demonstrates dataset quality through epidemiological alignment with real Australian GP consultation patterns (BEACH study), stylometric analysis confirming high linguistic variation, semantic diversity analysis demonstrating broad coverage, and exploratory downstream evaluation using self-supervised medical concept extraction, showing F1 improvements. SynGP500 addresses a critical national gap, providing researchers and educators with a resource for developing and evaluating clinical NLP methods for Australian general practice while inherently protecting patient privacy.

*Yiliu Sun,Zicheng Zhao,Yang Wei,Yanfang Zhang,Chen Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPPO, a novel RLVR approach focusing on prefix token optimization in LLM reasoning, leading to significant accuracy improvements with reduced training tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR approaches inefficiently train on all tokens, neglecting the contributions of prefix tokens to reasoning.

Method: The proposed PPPO explicitly targets the prefix reasoning process using two strategies: Progressive Prefix Retention and Continuation Accumulated Reward.

Result: PPPO achieves an 18.02% accuracy improvement while using only 26.17% of training tokens compared to existing RLVR methods.

Conclusion: Focusing on prefix tokens enhances the reasoning capability and efficiency of LLMs, as evidenced by the performance of PPPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.

*Xiaotian Zhang,Yuan Wang,Ruizhe Chen,Zeya Wang,Runchen Hou,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes PersonalAgent, a lifelong adaptive system for enhancing user preference alignment in conversational systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment techniques fail to address long-term personalization and the user cold-start problem, which are crucial for interactive systems utilizing LLMs.

Method: The approach involves constructing a dynamic unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions and treating preference inference as a sequential decision-making process.

Result: Experiments demonstrated superior performance of PersonalAgent in both idealized and noisy contexts over existing methods, ensuring cross-session consistency of user preferences.

Conclusion: PersonalAgent highlights the significance of personalized, adaptive interactions, paving the way for more user-centric conversational agents.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive systems necessitates a deep alignment with the nuanced and dynamic preferences of individual users. Current alignment techniques predominantly address universal human values or static, single-turn preferences, thereby failing to address the critical needs of long-term personalization and the initial user cold-start problem. To bridge this gap, we propose PersonalAgent, a novel user-centric lifelong agent designed to continuously infer and adapt to user preferences. PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions, framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task. Experiments show that PersonalAgent achieves superior performance over strong prompt-based and policy optimization baselines, not only in idealized but also in noisy conversational contexts, while preserving cross-session preference consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation confirms that PersonalAgent excels at capturing user preferences naturally and coherently. Our findings underscore the importance of lifelong personalization for developing more inclusive and adaptive conversational agents. Our code is available here.

### [48] [Evaluating LLMs for Zeolite Synthesis Event Extraction (ZSEE): A Systematic Analysis of Prompting Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15312)
*Charan Prakash Rathore,Saumi Ray,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the effectiveness of different prompting strategies for large language models (LLMs) in extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experiments, finding high-level understanding but limited fine-grained task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in extracting structured scientific information from zeolite synthesis procedures, which is essential for materials discovery.

Method: The study evaluates six state-of-the-art LLMs across four key extraction subtasks and tests four prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, reflection-based) using the ZSEE dataset containing 1,530 annotated sentences.

Result: LLMs demonstrated strong performance in event type classification (80-90% F1) but struggled with fine-grained extraction tasks like argument roles and texts (50-65% F1). Advanced prompting strategies did not significantly outperform zero-shot approaches, revealing limitations in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs can perform high-level understanding tasks but lack the precision needed for fine-grained scientific parameter extraction. Domain-adapted models are necessary to overcome these limitations.

Abstract: Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.

TL;DR: The study evaluates thematic dispersion in Arabic Applied Linguistics using Brookes' Measure, finding the field to be highly heterogeneous.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the thematic structure and dispersion within Arabic Applied Linguistics research utilizing bibliometric methods.

Method: Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion is applied to analyze 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025 across eight subfields.

Result: The dispersion index is Δ = 0.194, indicating extreme thematic heterogeneity with prominent subfields like Computational Linguistics and Sociolinguistics but no dominating core.

Conclusion: The research highlights the heterogeneity in Arabic Applied Linguistics, validates Brookes' formula, and offers a replicable method for disciplinary analysis.

Abstract: This study applies Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion (Δ) to analyze the thematic structure of contemporary Arabic Applied Linguistics research. Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of Δ = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields. This study clarifies the correct application of Brookes' original formula, demonstrates its utility for field characterization, and provides a replicable bibliometric methodology for assessing disciplinary structure across domains.

### [50] [Adversarial versification in portuguese as a jailbreak operator in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15353)
*Joao Queiroz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that transforming prompts into poetry significantly increases the susceptibility of large language models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks, leading to substantial safety failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the structural vulnerabilities of aligned LLMs and investigate how minimal variations, such as versification, exploit these weaknesses in adversarial contexts.

Method: The study analyzes the success rates of adversarial prompts rewritten as poetry, comparing manual and automated formulations and examining multiple LLM alignment approaches under varying poetic structures.

Result: Results show high adversarial success rates, with structurally aligned models consistently failing to handle poetic prompts, highlighting their reliance on surface patterns rather than deeper AI robustness.

Conclusion: Versification reveals critical safety flaws in aligned LLMs. To address these vulnerabilities, specifically in languages like Portuguese, evaluation metrics should include poetic structures such as metre and prosodic variation.

Abstract: Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap. Experimental protocols must parameterise scansion, metre, and prosodic variation to test vulnerabilities specific to Lusophone patterns, which are currently ignored.

TL;DR: The paper presents Denser, a novel framework for optimizing language density in reasoning and answering phases, achieving 62% efficiency gains in token usage compared to traditional methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency caused by uniform language density in reasoning tasks, aiming to improve computational efficiency.

Method: Proposed Denser, which uses high-density compressed language for reasoning and human-readable language for answers. It includes a query processing module, compressed reasoning mechanism, and answer generation component.

Result: Denser reduces token usage by up to 62% while maintaining or improving answer accuracy in multiple benchmarks, especially effective for multi-step reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Denser improves language model efficiency by separating reasoning and answer phases, enabling significant computational and token usage savings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches employ uniform language density for both intermediate reasoning and final answers, leading to computational inefficiency. Our observation found that reasoning process serves a computational function for the model itself, while answering serves a communicative function for human understanding. This distinction enables the use of compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate computations while maintaining human-readable final explanations. To address this inefficiency, we present Denser: \underline{D}ual-d\underline{ens}ity inf\underline{er}ence, a novel framework that optimizes information density separately for reasoning and answering phases. Our framework implements this through three components: a query processing module that analyzes input problems, a high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and an answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions. Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning question answering benchmarks demonstrates that Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62\% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy. These efficiency gains are particularly significant for complex multi-step reasoning problems where traditional methods generate extensive explanations.

TL;DR: The study explores using AI, through fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), to replicate Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques for scalable health behavior support, achieving promising but not yet fully equivalent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replacing human counselors with scalable AI systems in Motivational Interviewing to overcome the limitations posed by the demand for highly-trained professionals.

Method: Chinese psychological counseling datasets were used to train and fine-tune three Chinese-capable open-source large language models with MI principles, followed by evaluations via automatic metrics and expert coding.

Result: Fine-tuning improved linguistic metrics and core MI adherence in LLMs, though they lacked proficiency in complex MI skills like reflections and certain ratios.

Conclusion: MI fine-tuning helps endow LLMs with MI-consistent skills, making them a potential scalable tool for AI-assisted health interventions, though improvements and real-world trials are necessary.

Abstract: Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective counseling approach for promoting health behavior change, but its impact is constrained by the need for highly trained human counselors. Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.

Motivation: To bridge the gap in sentiment analysis involving civil unrest, especially in underrepresented languages like Bangla, during a national crisis.

Method: The study collected 2,028 annotated Bangla news headlines and used thematic analysis (LDA) and sentiment classification to evaluate public emotions during Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising.

Result: The researchers categorized emotions into Outrage, Hope, and Despair, identifying key themes. A Bangla-specific model surpassed multilingual and traditional methods, with accuracy scores of 77%, outperforming mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

Conclusion: Language-specific models excelled in understanding public sentiment in Bangla during a period of political turmoil, providing a valuable framework for future studies in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, an emerging research area within natural language processing (NLP), has primarily been explored in contexts like elections and social media trends, but there remains a significant gap in understanding emotional dynamics during civil unrest, particularly in the Bangla language. Our study pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during a national crisis by examining public emotions amid Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising. We curated a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair. Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analyzed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns. It outperformed multilingual transformers (mBERT: 67%, XLM-RoBERTa: 71%) and traditional machine learning methods (SVM and Logistic Regression: both 70%). These results highlight the effectiveness of language-specific models and offer valuable insights into public sentiment during political turmoil.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'CTKVR,' a novel method to optimize Key-Value (KV) retrieval in long-context language models. It achieves efficiency through a two-stage retrieval process and hardware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long context processing in language models suffers from inefficiency due to high memory overhead and retrieval latency, constraining their practical applications.

Method: A two-stage KV retrieval system: first, centroid-level indexing using precomputed centroids, followed by token-level refinement to ensure precise retrieval. The method also utilizes CPU-GPU co-execution for indexing and search optimization.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves throughput (3-4x speedups) on large models like Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at extended context lengths, with less than 1% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: CTKVR balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy in long-context LLMs, making them more practical for real-world applications through notable improvements in speed and system optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

TL;DR: The paper studies how linguistic inflection classes can be learned through unsupervised clustering using Adaptive Resonance Theory in Latin, Portuguese, and Estonian, yielding insights into morphological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language users cognitively acquire and process verbal inflection patterns, and to explore how computational models might replicate this process.

Method: The authors applied Adaptive Resonance Theory (a neural network model) with a vigilance parameter, performing unsupervised clustering of lexemes into inflection classes across three languages—Latin, Portuguese, and Estonian.

Result: The clustering achieved results reflecting attested linguistic inflection classes, with performance peaking at a specific vigilance parameter value and demonstrating linguistic relevance in learned features.

Conclusion: The model effectively simulates the acquisition of inflection classes and holds potential for studying linguistic evolution and changes in inflection systems through future agent-based modeling.

Abstract: The concept of inflection classes is an abstraction used by linguists, and provides a means to describe patterns in languages that give an analogical base for deducing previously unencountered forms. This ability is an important part of morphological acquisition and processing. We study the learnability of a system of verbal inflection classes by the individual language user by performing unsupervised clustering of lexemes into inflection classes. As a cognitively plausible and interpretable computational model, we use Adaptive Resonance Theory, a neural network with a parameter that determines the degree of generalisation (vigilance). The model is applied to Latin, Portuguese and Estonian. The similarity of clustering to attested inflection classes varies depending on the complexity of the inflectional system. We find the best performance in a narrow region of the generalisation parameter. The learned features extracted from the model show similarity with linguistic descriptions of the inflection classes. The proposed model could be used to study change in inflection classes in the future, by including it in an agent-based model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for identifying essential English words for language learners, like the General Service List, are time-consuming and rely heavily on linguistic expertise.

Method: The authors created their own SWLs using an automated, objective process and compared their effectiveness against the NGSL using coverage metrics.

Result: The SWL created using their model achieved the required 95% language comprehension coverage with fewer words compared to the NGSL.

Conclusion: By using an automated and objective process to create tailored word lists, language learners can benefit from scaled, customizable solutions to optimize their learning experience.

Abstract: Traditional linguists have proposed the use of a General Service List (GSL) to assist new language learners in identifying the most important words in English. This process requires linguistic expertise, subjective input, and a considerable amount of time. We attempt to create our own GSL and evaluate its practicality against the industry standard (The NGSL). We found creating a Specialized Word List (SWL), or a word list specific to a subset of the overall corpus, to be the most practical way for language-learners to optimize the process. The SWL's that we created using our model outperformed the industry standard, reaching the 95% coverage required for language comprehension with fewer words comparatively. By restricting the SWL process to objective criteria only, it can be automated, scaled, and tailored to the needs of language-learners across the globe.

*Lifeng Han,Gareth J. F. Jones,Alan F. Smeaton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of Chinese character decomposition technology in improving machine translation performance for Multi-word Expressions (MWEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by MWEs in neural machine translation, especially in under-researched languages like Chinese, where sub-word techniques from Western languages are not directly applicable.

Method: Chinese character decomposition technology is systematically studied to represent original word meanings better and manage MWE translations effectively in neural machine translation.

Result: The study demonstrates how Chinese character decomposition enhances the translation of MWEs and contributes to better representation of Chinese words and characters.

Conclusion: Chinese character decomposition serves as a promising technique to overcome linguistic challenges posed by MWEs in neural machine translation, particularly for ideographic languages like Chinese.

Abstract: Word meaning, representation, and interpretation play fundamental roles in natural language understanding (NLU), natural language processing (NLP), and natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.

TL;DR: Bolmo is a family of byte-level language models (LMs) that are competitive with subword-level LMs, offering benefits like better character understanding and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of subword tokenizations, such as poor character understanding and inefficiency due to fixed vocabularies, necessitate better alternatives that do not sacrifice performance.

Method: The authors propose 'byteification'—converting subword-level LMs into byte-level models through an expressivity-matching architecture and an efficient distillation objective, requiring minimal computational resources.

Result: Bolmo surpasses prior byte-level LMs in performance, matches near-parity on general tasks with subword LMs, and excels in character understanding and coding while achieving competitive inference speeds.

Conclusion: Bolmo demonstrates byte-level LMs as a practical, efficient, and competitive alternative to subword-level LMs for various applications.

Abstract: We introduce Bolmo, the first family of competitive fully open byte-level language models (LMs) at the 1B and 7B parameter scales. In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.

Result: The pipeline reduced annotation time by 22.4% and performed well in expert reviews. Language models showed room for improvement, while corpus analyses indicated patterns in defense usage.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the challenges in understanding psychological defenses in dialogues and offer tools to advance research; materials will be publicly released for further study.

Abstract: Psychological defenses are strategies, often automatic, that people use to manage distress. Rigid or overuse of defenses is negatively linked to mental health and shapes what speakers disclose and how they accept or resist help. However, defenses are complex and difficult to reliably measure, particularly in clinical dialogues. We introduce PsyDefConv, a dialogue corpus with help seeker utterances labeled for defense level, and DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline that provides evidence-based pre-annotations. The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses. Corpus analyses confirm that mature defenses are most common and reveal emotion-specific deviations. We will release the corpus, annotations, code, and prompts to support research on defensive functioning in language.

### [61] [Evaluating Metrics for Safety with LLM-as-Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15617)
*Kester Clegg,Richard Hawkins,Ibrahim Habli,Tom Lawton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores ways to safely integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into critical tasks, focusing on evaluation frameworks that use LLMs as judges (LaJ) and proposing risk mitigation measures using weighted metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in critical information processes, but their error rate raises safety concerns in tasks like medical triage or nuclear facility scheduling.

Method: The paper suggests employing weighted metrics and context sensitivity to evaluate LLMs reliability, as well as designing confidence thresholds to escalate low-concordance judgments for human review.

Result: This approach can lower error rates, assess error severity, and establish protocols for human intervention when LLM evaluations are unreliable.

Conclusion: Adopting robust evaluation metrics and human review triggers can improve the safety and reliability of LLMs in critical operations.

Abstract: LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.

### [62] [How Much is Too Much? Exploring LoRA Rank Trade-offs for Retaining Knowledge and Domain Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15634)
*Darshita Rathore,Vineet Kumar,Chetna Bansal,Anindya Moitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and compares supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on downstream tasks, analyzing performance trade-offs, generalisation, and internal representation changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the under-explored impacts of specific parameter-efficient fine-tuning configurations (e.g., rank) on downstream tasks, generalisation, and performance differences compared to supervised fine-tuning.

Method: A comprehensive evaluation of reasoning and recall datasets was conducted using PEFT approaches like LoRA, including rank sweeps to investigate trade-offs. Internal representations were analyzed through spectral features and layer-wise attention structures.

Result: LoRA showed competitive or better performance than SFT, particularly for reasoning tasks at certain ranks. Differences in generalisation, task-specific forgetting, and structural attention changes were highlighted.

Conclusion: LoRA is a viable alternative to SFT for many tasks, with specific settings enabling superior performance. The study provides insights into representational and attention dynamics during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.

### [63] [Characterizing Mamba's Selective Memory using Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15653)
*Tamanna Hossain,Robert L. Logan,Ganesh Jagadeesan,Sameer Singh,Joel Tetreault,Alejandro Jaimes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how State Space Models (SSMs) tend to forget certain types of information in sequences by reconstructing data using an autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs promise efficient language modeling due to their fixed memory usage but suffer from information loss in long sequences. The gap in understanding the forgotten information motivates this study.

Method: An auto-encoder is trained to reconstruct sequences from SSM hidden states, and information loss is measured by comparing original inputs with reconstructed sequences.

Result: SSMs show higher information loss for math-related tokens, named entities, and less frequent tokens/data such as alternative dialects. Less frequent tokens in pretraining data are more prone to being forgotten.

Conclusion: The study highlights the relationship between token frequency and forgetting rates in SSMs, guiding future research to mitigate information loss and improve retention of less frequent tokens or sequences.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) are a promising alternative to transformers for language modeling because they use fixed memory during inference. However, this fixed memory usage requires some information loss in the hidden state when processing long sequences. While prior work has studied the sequence length at which this information loss occurs, it does not characterize the types of information SSM language models (LMs) tend to forget. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by identifying the types of tokens (e.g., parts of speech, named entities) and sequences (e.g., code, math problems) that are more frequently forgotten by SSM LMs. We achieve this by training an auto-encoder to reconstruct sequences from the SSM's hidden state, and measure information loss by comparing inputs with their reconstructions. We perform experiments using the Mamba family of SSM LMs (130M--1.4B) on sequences ranging from 4--256 tokens. Our results show significantly higher rates of information loss on math-related tokens (e.g., numbers, variables), mentions of organization entities, and alternative dialects to Standard American English. We then examine the frequency that these tokens appear in Mamba's pretraining data and find that less prevalent tokens tend to be the ones Mamba is most likely to forget. By identifying these patterns, our work provides clear direction for future research to develop methods that better control Mamba's ability to retain important information.

*Xiaodi Li,Dingcheng Li,Rujun Gao,Mahmoud Zamani,Feng Mi,Latifur Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduced PPSEBM, a novel framework for addressing catastrophic forgetting in continual learning using energy-based models and progressive parameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning in machine learning suffers from catastrophic forgetting, limiting a model's ability to retain past knowledge when learning new tasks.

Method: PPSEBM combines Progressive Parameter Selection (allocating task-specific parameters) and Energy-Based Models (generating pseudo-samples) to guide parameter selection and preserve past knowledge.

Result: Experimental results on NLP benchmarks show that PPSEBM outperforms existing continual learning approaches.

Conclusion: PPSEBM provides an effective and robust solution to catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for NLP tasks.

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

### [65] [Activation Oracles: Training and Evaluating LLMs as General-Purpose Activation Explainers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15674)
*Adam Karvonen,James Chua,Clément Dumas,Kit Fraser-Taliente,Subhash Kantamneni,Julian Minder,Euan Ong,Arnab Sen Sharma,Daniel Wen,Owain Evans,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores Activation Oracles (AOs) trained through LatentQA methods to interpret LLM activations better, achieving scalable and generalist performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLM activations is complex, and existing methods are limited. The motivation is to provide a simpler, scalable approach to extract and verbalize information about these activations in natural language.

Method: The LatentQA approach trains models to take LLM activations as inputs and answer natural-language queries about them. Activation Oracles are evaluated in diverse, out-of-distribution settings to test their scalability and improvement through diversified training data.

Result: AOs performed well, including recovering fine-tuned model-specific information. They outperformed prior baseline methods on most tasks, consistently improving with added training diversity.

Conclusion: Training AOs using diversified datasets leads to a general capability for accurately verbalizing LLM activation information, surpassing prior methods in scalability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.

### [66] [SkyCap: Bitemporal VHR Optical-SAR Quartets for Amplitude Change Detection and Foundation-Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14755)
*Paul Weinmann,Ferdinand Schenck,Martin Šiklar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SkyCap, a dataset combining optical (SkySat) and SAR (Capella) data for enhanced change detection in monitoring linear infrastructures. It evaluates foundation models for SAR data, showing the impact of preprocessing and cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges in monitoring linear infrastructures where reliable and regular data acquisition is needed but hindered by issues like clouds in optical imagery and difficulty in annotating SAR data.

Method: The authors developed a new dataset, SkyCap, combining optical-SAR data with optical-to-SAR label transfer techniques for SAR change detection. They benchmarked SAR-specific and optical foundation models under various preprocessing strategies.

Result: The study finds that an optical foundation model (MTP(ViT-B+RVSA)) combined with specific preprocessing (dB+Z-score) outperforms SAR-specific ones, highlighting preprocessing's sensitivity and domain-specific variances.

Conclusion: SkyCap dataset and optical-to-SAR label transfer enable effective SAR amplitude change detection without expert annotations. Preprocessing and cross-domain adaptation play critical roles.

Abstract: Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD.

*Tomohito Kawabata,Xinyu Zhang,Ling Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research develops SocialNav-MoE, a vision language model optimized for socially compliant navigation in human environments, focusing on both efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of exploration in socially compliant navigation in robots, particularly incorporating human comfort, social norms, and reducing computational overhead.

Method: Proposed an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model (SocialNav-MoE) reinforced with reinforcement fine-tuning and semantic similarity rewards to enhance decision-making.

Result: SocialNav-MoE shows excellent performance on the SNEI dataset, achieving a balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: SocialNav-MoE demonstrates its potential as a resource-efficient solution for real-time socially compliant robotic navigation, filling an underexplored research gap.

Abstract: For robots navigating in human-populated environments, safety and social compliance are equally critical, yet prior work has mostly emphasized safety. Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Fan Bu,Rongfeng Li,Zijin Li,Ya Li,Linfeng Fan,Pei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a system to digitize Chinese Jianpu notation with lyrics into machine-readable formats, achieving high recognition precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of research and digitization efforts in non-Western music notations, specifically Chinese Jianpu, and make these resources more accessible.

Method: The researchers developed a modular expert-system pipeline combining traditional computer-vision techniques and unsupervised deep learning to process printed Jianpu scores into MusicXML and MIDI formats.

Result: The system successfully digitized over 5,000 songs in melody-only datasets and 1,400 songs with lyrics, attaining high recognition precision for both melody (F1 = 0.951) and lyrics (F1 = 0.931).

Conclusion: This hybrid approach demonstrates a promising framework for efficiently digitizing non-Western music notation, balancing accuracy and interpretability without requiring extensive annotated data.

Abstract: Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).

*Afrah Shaahid,Muzammil Behzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AquaDiff is a framework for improving underwater images by addressing color distortion, low contrast, and loss of detail through diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from distortions due to light absorption and scattering, which affect their usability in underwater applications.

Method: AquaDiff combines chromatic prior-guided color compensation and conditional diffusion processes, along with enhanced denoising techniques and a novel cross-domain consistency loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show AquaDiff outperforms traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods in color correction and image quality.

Conclusion: AquaDiff improves underwater image enhancement by focusing on color correction and ensuring perceptual fidelity and structural integrity under various underwater conditions.

Abstract: Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DAVR, a framework aimed at improving the reliability of vision-language models (VLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA), addressing hallucination issues via dual-pathway uncertainty assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the issue of hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs), which produce overconfident but incorrect answers, to improve their reliability in Visual Question Answering (VQA).

Method: DAVR integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification into a dual-pathway approach: one path assesses reliability by fusing VLM latent features with Question-Answer embeddings, while the other path utilizes external reference models for factual cross-checking.

Result: DAVR demonstrated outstanding performance in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, achieving a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving answer reliability.

Conclusion: DAVR significantly enhances the trustworthiness of VLM responses by combining internal uncertainty analysis with external fact verification, establishing a robust framework for Reliable Visual Question Answering.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

### [71] [HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870)
*Dan Ben-Ami,Gabriele Serussi,Kobi Cohen,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERBench is introduced as a benchmark for Video Question Answering (VideoQA), demanding the integration of multiple evidential cues across video segments. Existing Video-LLMs struggle with this challenge, achieving only 31-42% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA benchmarks often fail to test capabilities of aggregating temporally separated cues, which are essential for robust reasoning in video understanding.

Method: HERBench evaluates VideoQA by requiring integration of at least three distinct cues across different video segments. It comprises 26K multiple-choice questions across twelve tasks, introducing the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS) metric to measure evidential complexity.

Result: HERBench imposes significantly higher evidential integration demand (mean MRFS 5.5) compared to prior datasets. State-of-the-art Video-LLMs show poor performance, scoring slightly above random chance.

Conclusion: HERBench highlights the deficiencies in current Video-LLMs, specifically in evidence retrieval and fusion. It fosters progress in developing models capable of robust, compositional understanding of videos.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) and proposes an efficient model using pose estimation, segmentation, and a ResNet-Transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap in automated language translation for American Sign Language (ASL) users, which is limited by visual complexity, scarce data, signer variability, and high computational demands.

Method: The proposed method includes a pose estimation pipeline to extract joint coordinates, a segmentation module for relevant information, and a ResNet-Transformer backbone to model spatial and temporal dependencies.

Result: While the abstract doesn't provide specific results, the proposed model claims to reduce computational requirements and remain robust to signer variation in ISLR tasks.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel approach to improve ISLR, potentially making ASL translation more accessible and computationally efficient.

Abstract: The recent surge in large language models has automated translations of spoken and written languages. However, these advances remain largely inaccessible to American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose language relies on complex visual cues. Isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) - the task of classifying videos of individual signs - can help bridge this gap but is currently limited by scarce per-sign data, high signer variability, and substantial computational costs. We propose a model for ISLR that reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation. Our approach integrates (i) a pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (ii) a segmentation module that isolates relevant information, and (iii) a ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper integrates textual descriptors into animal re-identification, enhancing AI's capabilities by combining visuals and human-interpretable language tags.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of image-based AI tools for animal re-identification and improve explainability by using textual descriptors derived from forensic methodologies.

Method: A text-image co-synthesis pipeline was developed, leveraging manually labelled minutiae and dermatoglyphic semantics to encode animal coat patterns for cross-modal retrieval.

Result: The proposed method enhanced AI accuracy in cross-modal identity retrieval, alleviated data scarcity, and demonstrated novel textual-to-visual capabilities.

Conclusion: Dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics unify descriptive modalities, overcoming vision-only limitations and boosting ecological monitoring explainability.

Abstract: Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Vibe Blending,' a novel method for generating creative and meaningful visual hybrids using shared attributes between ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address current limitations in creating visually coherent hybrids between distant concepts, which existing methods struggle to achieve.

Method: The authors propose 'Vibe Space,' a hierarchical graph manifold learning low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP for smooth and consistent transitions.

Result: Using human judgments, LLM reasoning, and geometric path difficulty scores, Vibe Space blends are rated as more creative and coherent compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Vibe Space effectively enhances creative blending between concepts, offering insightful solutions for generating meaningful visual hybrids.

Abstract: Creating new visual concepts often requires connecting distinct ideas through their most relevant shared attributes -- their vibe. We introduce Vibe Blending, a novel task for generating coherent and meaningful hybrids that reveals these shared attributes between images. Achieving such blends is challenging for current methods, which struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths linking distant concepts in latent space. We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score. We find that Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a dataset for evaluating AI models' biological robustness in prostate cancer Gleason grading. It highlights model performance variations and provides tools for further evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to assess AI models' reliance on biological signals versus confounding artifacts in prostate cancer diagnosis, which directly impacts treatment decisions.

Method: The authors created a curated benchmark dataset comprising expert-annotated prostate biopsies with diverse Gleason patterns. Models were assessed for their ability to isolate biological signals from confounders using standardized metrics on tissue patches.

Result: Significant variation in robustness was found among seven tested models. HistoEncoder showed the best performance for capturing biological features, while all models displayed gaps between within-slide and cross-slide accuracy.

Conclusion: PANDA-PLUS-Bench fills a crucial gap by offering researchers a standardized dataset and tools to evaluate the real-world robustness of foundation models for clinically relevant applications like Gleason grading.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.

TL;DR: The paper addresses glioma segmentation limitations in deep learning models and proposes adaptive post-processing techniques that improve segmentation quality and computational fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gliomas are highly lethal brain tumors requiring accurate segmentation for effective treatment, but existing deep learning models often make systematic errors and face challenges like GPU availability and environmental costs.

Method: Adaptive post-processing techniques were developed to refine glioma segmentations made by pretrained models in various brain tumor segmentation tasks.

Result: The proposed techniques improved segmentation ranking metrics by 14.9% in sub-Saharan Africa challenges and 0.9% in adult glioma challenges.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for a shift in glioma segmentation research toward post-processing strategies that are more efficient, clinically relevant, equitable, and sustainable, rather than focusing solely on complex model architectures.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

*Zhenzhi Wang,Jian Wang,Ke Ma,Dahua Lin,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TalkVerse, a large-scale dataset and framework for audio-driven human video generation, enabling reproducibility and fair comparison across models while offering a low-cost 5B model and open resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of open, standardized data for evaluating audio-driven talking video generation methods and to provide a reproducible framework for research with reduced computational costs.

Method: TalkVerse was created using a transparent pipeline for curating 2.3 million high-resolution audio-video clips, adding annotations like 2D skeletons and style captions. The authors developed a 5B DiT model with a video VAE and sliding window mechanism, allowing efficient, long-minute generation with reduced drift. Additional support for storytelling and zero-shot dubbing was included.

Result: The 5B model achieves comparable lip-sync and visual quality to more expensive models but at one-tenth the computational cost. The integration of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director enhances storytelling abilities, and the model also supports zero-shot dubbing.

Conclusion: TalkVerse and its associated tools allow for lower-cost, reproducible research in audio-driven video generation, setting a standard for the field and broadening accessibility through open-source resources.

Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

TL;DR: The paper introduces Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a reinforcement learning framework that improves Visual Language Models (VLMs) reasoning abilities without relying on manual annotations or external verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in current reinforcement learning approaches like GRPO for VLMs, including reliance on annotations, flat reward structures, and logical inconsistencies.

Method: Develops PC-GRPO with self-supervised puzzle tasks (e.g., PatchFit, Rotation, Jigsaw), dynamic difficulty-aware curriculum, and reasoning-answer consistency (RAC) monitoring.

Result: PC-GRPO enhances reasoning quality, increases training stability, and improves accuracy across benchmarks using Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones.

Conclusion: PC-GRPO offers a scalable and interpretable reinforcement learning approach, providing verifiable rewards without external reliance for VLMs.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.

Motivation: To address the problem of missing or degraded modalities in person recognition systems under real-world conditions.

Method: A Trimodal framework utilizing multi-task learning, cross-attention, gated fusion mechanisms, and confidence-weighted fusion to handle person recognition robustly for varying modalities.

Result: The system achieved 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on a newly introduced dataset (CANDOR) and 99.92% accuracy on the VoxCeleb1 dataset in Bimodal mode.

Conclusion: The proposed system shows superior accuracy compared to Unimodal and late-fusion methods and demonstrates robustness in scenarios where one or two modalities are unavailable.

Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

### [80] [Where is the Watermark? Interpretable Watermark Detection at the Block Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14994)
*Maria Bulychev,Neil G. Marchant,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a watermarking approach that ensures images have detectable, localized, and interpretable watermark regions, while maintaining robustness and imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking mechanisms lack transparency and provide only global detection scores, which reduces user trust and complicates interpreting tampering impact.

Method: The method involves embedding watermark signals using a statistical block-wise strategy in the discrete wavelet transform domain, enabling detection maps to show localized watermarked or altered regions.

Result: The proposed method achieves high robustness against image transformations, detects semantic manipulations, and keeps watermarks imperceptible. It displays competitive robustness with interpretable detection, such as handling cropping up to half the image.

Conclusion: This watermarking scheme provides localized interpretability, trustworthy detection maps, and robust performance, addressing limitations in prior approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

*Sibi Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pose-based computational framework to classify social interactions in livestock by analyzing keypoint trajectories, outperforming proximity-only methods, particularly for affiliative behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static proximity thresholds in assessing livestock social behaviors, which fail to distinguish affiliative from agonistic interactions in complex environments.

Method: Developed a vision-based computational framework using YOLOv11 for object detection, ZebraPose for anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier for analyzing interaction-specific motion signatures.

Result: Achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative vs. agonistic behaviors and showed significant performance gains over proximity-based methods, especially for affiliative interactions.

Conclusion: The framework is suitable for real-time inference of social interactions in livestock, offering improved analysis for social network construction and herd welfare monitoring.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

*Huaying Zhang,Atsushi Hashimoto,Tosho Hirasawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the evaluation of video question generation (VQG) models, focusing on question quality for eliciting expert knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand what makes questions effective in extracting expert knowledge and to improve VQG models.

Method: Introducing a novel evaluation protocol for VQG through simulated expert communication, leveraging a newly created QA dataset called EgoExoAsk.

Result: Demonstrates that models with richer contexts are rated better under the proposed metric, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol successfully evaluates VQG models in terms of eliciting unseen knowledge, emphasizing the importance of question quality.

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

*Yunseong Nam,Jiwon Jang,Dongkyu Won,Sang Hyun Park,Soopil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPO, a novel framework for model-agnostic preference optimization in medical image segmentation, improving performance without direct ground-truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image segmentation approaches depend on model-specific techniques and lack diversity in prediction sampling, causing limitations in scalability and generalization.

Method: MAPO leverages Dropout-based stochastic segmentations to form preference-consistent gradients and eliminates the need for direct ground-truth supervision while being compatible with any model architecture.

Result: MAPO improves boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and stabilizes optimization dynamics across various medical datasets.

Conclusion: MAPO presents an architecture-agnostic solution that enhances medical image segmentation performance and generalizability in both 2D and 3D domains.

Abstract: Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of rendering high-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes from low-resolution inputs by introducing a novel Multi-View Consistent Super-Resolution framework (MVGSR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3DGS super-resolution rely on single-image or video-based approaches that lack view consistency or require strict temporal order, making them unsuitable for enhanced rendering from unstructured multi-view datasets.

Method: The authors propose MVGSR, which includes an Auxiliary View Selection Method for handling arbitrary multi-view datasets and introduces an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism to improve geometric consistency and detail fidelity.

Result: MVGSR achieves superior performance compared to prior methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on 3DGS super-resolution benchmarks for both object-centric and scene-level tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between low-resolution inputs and high-resolution 3DGS rendering, offering improved multi-view consistency and fidelity for unstructured datasets.

Abstract: Scenes reconstructed by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) trained on low-resolution (LR) images are unsuitable for high-resolution (HR) rendering. Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety in automated driving by developing better evaluation metrics that can distinguish between safety-critical and non-relevant objects.

Method: Conducted a review of existing criticality metrics, validated their performance using the DeepAccident dataset, and introduced bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation as novel strategies.

Result: The proposed methods led to up to a 100% improvement in criticality classification accuracy for object detection systems.

Conclusion: Novel evaluation strategies substantially improve the reliability of safety assessments in automated driving systems, promoting better perception and safety outcomes.

Abstract: Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of traditional high-speed camera-based measurement methods, including high costs and poor performance in harsh lighting conditions.

Method: The approach employs an event camera and LED markers, filtering observation noise based on event stream characteristics and spatiotemporal correlation. LED markers are extracted after distinguishing between motion-induced and LED-blinking events. A monocular event camera is used to measure deformations.

Result: Experimental results validate the proposed method's accuracy in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

Conclusion: The presented method offers a cost-effective and robust solution for accurately measuring high-frequency deformations even under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the critical issue of monocular depth model hallucinations on planar but ambiguous visuals, introducing the 3D Mirage concept and tools to probe, quantify, and mitigate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth models often fail on perceptually ambiguous planar inputs, generating illusory 3D structures, posing safety risks.

Method: The paper develops the 3D-Mirage benchmark, Laplacian-based metrics for evaluation, and Grounded Self-Distillation to enforce planarity while preserving other knowledge.

Result: Tools and metrics were introduced to better understand and control depth hallucinations, emphasizing structural and contextual robustness in model evaluations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved depth evaluation methods beyond pixel-wise accuracy, with publicly accessible tools fostering future research.

Abstract: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.

*Chenxiao Zhang,Runshi Zhang,Junchen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel network for segmenting and tracking objects in ultrasound videos, addressing challenges like low contrast and noisy backgrounds using memory bank-based wavelet filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulties in accurately segmenting and tracking organs and lesions in ultrasound videos due to low contrast, noisy backgrounds, and boundary segmentation errors necessitated a more effective solution.

Method: A memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network was proposed, integrating features like wavelet convolution, cascaded wavelet compression, cross-attention mechanisms, and adaptive filters.

Result: The approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in segmentation tasks on four ultrasound video datasets, especially improving accuracy for small thyroid nodules.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively segments small ultrasound objects in long videos, validating its utility in medical applications and addressing key challenges in computer-assisted surgery workflows.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

Result: Experiments on DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD surpasses existing methods in terms of consistency, detail quality, and controllability of generated images.

Conclusion: PMMD provides advancements in photorealistic human image synthesis by addressing cross-modal discrepancies and offering improved identity fidelity, detail enhancement, and controllability.

Abstract: Generating consistent human images with controllable pose and appearance is essential for applications in virtual try on, image editing, and digital human creation. Current methods often suffer from occlusions, garment style drift, and pose misalignment. We propose Pose-guided Multi-view Multimodal Diffusion (PMMD), a diffusion framework that synthesizes photorealistic person images conditioned on multi-view references, pose maps, and text prompts. A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline. Experiments on the DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD outperforms representative baselines in consistency, detail preservation, and controllability.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the Nano Banana Pro model for low-level vision tasks, finding it excels in subjective visual quality but struggles with pixel-level consistency required by traditional quantitative metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether a commercial text-to-image model, Nano Banana Pro, can serve as a generalist for traditional low-level vision tasks.

Method: Conducted zero-shot evaluations of Nano Banana Pro across 14 distinct low-level tasks using 40 datasets, compared against state-of-the-art specialist models, employing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning.

Result: Nano Banana Pro exhibits superior subjective visual quality but falls short in traditional quantitative metrics due to its stochastic generative nature.

Conclusion: Nano Banana Pro has potential as a zero-shot practitioner for low-level vision, but achieving fidelity on par with specialist models remains a challenge.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

### [92] [3DProxyImg: Controllable 3D-Aware Animation Synthesis from Single Image via 2D-3D Aligned Proxy Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15126)
*Yupeng Zhu,Xiongzhen Zhang,Ye Chen,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D animation framework decoupling geometry control from appearance synthesis to address limitations in rendering quality and 3D controllability, enabling efficient animation generation with high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify and optimize 3D animation production, which traditionally is labor-intensive, costly, and requires expertise, with current methods failing to balance rendering quality and controllability.

Method: The framework introduces a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that utilizes a coarse 3D structure for geometry and learned image-space generative priors for appearance and view synthesis.

Result: The method delivers efficient and interactive 3D animation on low-power platforms, surpassing video-based methods in identity preservation, consistency, and controllability.

Conclusion: The proxy-based lightweight framework effectively addresses trade-offs in 3D animation, combining efficient generation with high fidelity and interactive control ideal for lower-cost platforms.

Abstract: 3D animation is central to modern visual media, yet traditional production pipelines remain labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.
  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.

*Shengxiao Zhou,Chenghua Li,Jianhao Huang,Qinghao Hu,Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents GENIE, a framework for better instance editing by disentangling intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of semantic entanglement limits instance editing since the challenge lies in disentangling intrinsic appearance and extrinsic attributes from reference data.

Method: GENIE employs a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) to correct spatial misalignments, an Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) to amplify intrinsic cues and suppress extrinsic features, and a Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) to apply the disentangled information onto the target.

Result: Extensive experiments on the AnyInsertion dataset show that GENIE achieves superior fidelity and robustness compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: GENIE sets a new benchmark for disentanglement-based instance editing by successfully resolving the semantic entanglement problem.

Abstract: Reference-guided instance editing is fundamentally limited by semantic entanglement, where a reference's intrinsic appearance is intertwined with its extrinsic attributes. The key challenge lies in disentangling what information should be borrowed from the reference, and determining how to apply it appropriately to the target. To tackle this challenge, we propose GENIE, a Generalizable Instance Editing framework capable of achieving explicit disentanglement. GENIE first corrects spatial misalignments with a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM). Then, an Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) learns what to borrow by amplifying salient intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, while a Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) mechanism learns how to render this appearance onto the target, preserving its structure. Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset demonstrate that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.

*Mengshi Qi,Yeteng Wu,Xianlin Zhang,Huadong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task, dataset, and method for assessing and improving human action standardization effectively, with strong results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods do not assess action standardization or offer detailed feedback, and existing datasets lack nuanced annotations for action quality assessment.

Method: The authors define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, create the CoT-AFA dataset with chain-of-thought explanations, and propose the Explainable Fitness Assessor framework integrating visual and semantic data for reasoning and feedback.

Result: The proposed framework improves explanation generation (+16.0% CIDEr), action classification accuracy (+2.7%), and quality assessment accuracy (+2.1%).

Conclusion: The introduced CoT-AFA dataset and Explainable Fitness Assessor have significant potential for future research, offering comprehensive tools for human action form assessment and feedback.

Abstract: Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Hang Zhang,Mu Xu,Yang Han,Hong Zhang,Ding Yuan,Yifan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EagleVision improves spatial reasoning by introducing a dual-stage framework for 3D perception and verification, achieving state-of-the-art results in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial intelligence models often lack spatial consistency, multi-viewpoint diversity, and traceability to supporting evidence, making them insufficient for accurate spatial reasoning.

Method: The framework includes two stages: 'Macro perception,' employing SPF-DPP to select keyframes from videos under fixed token budgets, and 'Micro verification,' where spatial reasoning is posed as BEV-grounded pose querying and optimized through reinforcement learning.

Result: EagleVision demonstrated superior spatial reasoning capabilities, outperforming existing open-source vision-language models on the VSI-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: EagleVision's innovative dual-stage methodology solves major challenges in spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, showing significant advancements in spatial intelligence frameworks.

Abstract: Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CMUS-Net, a model for classifying multiple glomerular diseases using multi-modal and multi-scale renal biopsy images, achieving high performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with effective fusion and classification due to nanoscale and microscale differences in renal biopsy images.

Method: They developed CMUS-Net, utilizing sparse multi-instance learning and cross-modal scale attention modules, combined with multi-loss functions to aid diagnosis.

Result: CMUS-Net achieved an accuracy of 95.37%, AUC of 99.05%, and F1-score of 95.32% on an in-house dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: CMUS-Net effectively addresses scale differences, enhances classification accuracy, and shows generalization capability in staging glomerular diseases through multi-modal data.

Abstract: Constructing a multi-modal automatic classification model based on three types of renal biopsy images can assist pathologists in glomerular multi-disease identification. However, the substantial scale difference between transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image features at the nanoscale and optical microscopy (OM) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IM) images at the microscale poses a challenge for existing multi-modal and multi-scale models in achieving effective feature fusion and improving classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal ultra-scale learning network (CMUS-Net) for the auxiliary diagnosis of multiple glomerular diseases. CMUS-Net utilizes multiple ultrastructural information to bridge the scale difference between nanometer and micrometer images. Specifically, we introduce a sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate features from TEM images. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal scale attention module to facilitate feature interaction, enhancing pathological semantic information. Finally, multiple loss functions are combined, allowing the model to weigh the importance among different modalities and achieve precise classification of glomerular diseases. Our method follows the conventional process of renal biopsy pathology diagnosis and, for the first time, performs automatic classification of multiple glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (LN) based on images from three modalities and two scales. On an in-house dataset, CMUS-Net achieves an ACC of 95.37+/-2.41%, an AUC of 99.05+/-0.53%, and an F1-score of 95.32+/-2.41%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMUS-Net outperforms other well-known multi-modal or multi-scale methods and show its generalization capability in staging MN.

*Sarim Hashmi,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Mohammed Talha Alam,Samuele Poppi,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deepfake detection suffers from high false positive rates (FPR) and lack of robustness against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces a resynthesis framework that improves detection reliability and robustness against low-compute adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes undermine digital media authenticity and current detection methods fail due to high FPRs and weakness against adaptive attackers. There's a critical need for a robust, reliable deepfake detection approach.

Method: The paper proposes a calibrated resynthesis framework utilizing advanced inversion techniques to verify authenticity with controllable FPRs and to maintain robustness against efficient adversaries.

Result: The resynthesis method reliably verifies authentic content with low FPRs and demonstrates strong adversarial robustness against compute-restricted adversaries compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach advances the reliability and robustness of deepfake detection systems, addressing key limitations of current methods and supporting multiple modalities.

Abstract: Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

*Jianan Wang,Yang Hong,Hesong Li,Tao Wang,Songrong Liu,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet) that efficiently enhances low-light RAW images by leveraging a multi-scale parallel architecture and green channel guidance, achieving superior performance and high speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAW image enhancement methods struggle to balance performance and efficiency due to sequential processing of multi-scale information and the underutilization of the green channel's potential advantage.

Method: ERIENet uses an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with channel-aware residual dense blocks and a green channel guidance branch to enhance low-light RAW images effectively while reducing computational cost.

Result: ERIENet improves low-light RAW image enhancement quality while achieving real-time performance, notably achieving 146 FPS for 4K-resolution images on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090.

Conclusion: ERIENet demonstrates that a parallel multi-scale architecture and leveraging green channel information can significantly advance low-light RAW image enhancement in both quality and efficiency.

Abstract: RAW images have shown superior performance than sRGB images in many image processing tasks, especially for low-light image enhancement. However, most existing methods for RAW-based low-light enhancement usually sequentially process multi-scale information, which makes it difficult to achieve lightweight models and high processing speeds. Besides, they usually ignore the green channel superiority of RAW images, and fail to achieve better reconstruction performance with good use of green channel information. In this work, we propose an efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet), which parallelly processes multi-scale information with efficient convolution modules, and takes advantage of rich information in green channels to guide the reconstruction of images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with a novel channel-aware residual dense block to extract feature maps, which reduces computational costs and achieves real-time processing speed. Secondly, we introduce a green channel guidance branch to exploit the rich information within the green channels of the input RAW image. It increases the quality of reconstruction results with few parameters and computations. Experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets show that ERIENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher effiency. It also achieves an optimal speed of over 146 frame-per-second (FPS) for 4K-resolution images on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 with 24G memory.

*Yufeng Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric to address traditional issues in infrared-visible image fusion for UAV reconnaissance in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image fusion metrics like Entropy and Average Gradient fail in low-light environments by misinterpreting high-frequency noise as valid details, leading to unreliable guidance for fusion algorithms.

Method: The proposed TBC metric, inspired by Weber's Law, focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets instead of relying on global statistical analyses, penalizing background noise and emphasizing target visibility.

Result: Tests on the DroneVehicle dataset show that TBC correlates better with human perception and provides a more reliable standard in low-altitude reconnaissance scenarios.

Conclusion: The TBC metric improves infrared-visible image fusion reliability by minimizing noise-induced distortions and enhancing relevant features, particularly in complex low-light environments.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion is a pivotal technology in low-altitude UAV reconnaissance missions, providing high-quality data support for downstream tasks such as target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with background texture details.However, traditional no-reference metrics fail(Specifically,like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG)) in complex low-light environments. They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a "Noise Trap," paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Mesh-Plug, a module to accurately transform 3D human meshes from camera to world coordinates, solving issues related to camera rotation. It uses RGB and depth maps for rotation prediction and body pose adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods err when transforming 3D human meshes to the world coordinate system due to the assumption of zero camera rotation. Solving this helps achieve more accurate real-world applications.

Method: The authors developed Mesh-Plug, which predicts camera rotation parameters using a human-centered approach with RGB images and depth maps. It integrates these predictions into a mesh adjustment module to refine the mesh's root orientation and body pose.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mesh-Plug surpasses state-of-the-art techniques on SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.

Conclusion: Mesh-Plug offers a robust solution to transform 3D human meshes by accurately estimating camera rotations and refining mesh attributes, improving performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D human meshes in the world coordinate system from in-the-wild images remains challenging due to the lack of camera rotation information. While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents SLCFormer, a framework for removing nighttime lens flare using spectral-local context transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively remove nonuniform scattered flares in complex nighttime scenarios, affecting visual quality.

Method: The proposed SLCFormer uses FFEM for global frequency domain processing and DESM for local spatial enhancement paired with a realistic scatter flare generation pipeline (ZernikeVAE).

Result: SLCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Flare7K++ dataset and generalizes well to real-world nighttime conditions.

Conclusion: The study introduces a robust solution for nighttime lens flare removal with competitive performance and real-world application potential.

Abstract: Lens flare is a common nighttime artifact caused by strong light sources scattering within camera lenses, leading to hazy streaks, halos, and glare that degrade visual quality. However, existing methods usually fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares, which severely reduces their applicability to complex real-world scenarios with diverse lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose SLCFormer, a novel spectral-local context transformer framework for effective nighttime lens flare removal. SLCFormer integrates two key modules: the Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module (FFEM), which captures efficient global contextual representations in the frequency domain to model flare characteristics, and the Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module (DESM) for local structural enhancement and directional features in the spatial domain for precise flare removal. Furthermore, we introduce a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline to synthesize physically realistic scatter flares with spatially varying PSFs, bridging optical physics and data-driven training. Extensive experiments on the Flare7K++ dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, and generalizing robustly to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the redundancy in low-rank adaptation methods and enhance parameter efficiency for large-scale model fine-tuning.

Method: Null-LoRA freezes parts of low-rank matrices and constrains incremental updates within null spaces to maximize adaptation efficiency.

Result: Null-LoRA outperforms existing methods in image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Null-LoRA demonstrates a novel approach to fine-tuning by leveraging null spaces, achieving state-of-the-art results while using fewer parameters.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have gained considerable popularity for adapting large-scale models to downstream tasks, particularly LoRA and its variants. Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms. Null-LoRA surpasses the state of the art with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

*Yupeng Zhang,Adam G. Dunn,Usman Naseem,Jinman Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel training framework, CMAC-MMD, for reducing diagnostic biases in medical AI systems across intersectional patient subgroups without compromising performance or requiring demographic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address intersectional biases in medical AI systems that result in less confident and potentially inaccurate diagnoses for marginalized patient subgroups.

Method: The proposed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD) framework equalizes decision confidence across patient subgroups without using sensitive demographic data. It was evaluated on datasets for skin lesions and glaucoma detection, analyzing performance by age, gender, and race.

Result: In dermatology, CMAC-MMD reduced the missed diagnosis gap (ΔTPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving AUC from 0.94 to 0.97. For glaucoma detection, ΔTPR decreased from 0.41 to 0.31, with AUC increasing slightly from 0.71 to 0.72.

Conclusion: CMAC-MMD provides a scalable and privacy-conscious framework for equitable and accurate performance in clinical decision support systems, addressing biases across diverse patient demographics.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

*Kuinan Hou,Jing Mi,Marco Zorzi,Lamberto Ballan,Alberto Testolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares specialized counting architectures with vision-language models (VLMs) and finds VLMs perform well, but further research is needed for counting objects in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether domain-general multimodal VLMs can reliably count objects in visual scenes, providing flexibility compared to specialized counting architectures.

Method: Systematic comparison of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures versus multimodal VLMs using existing counting datasets and a novel dataset with finer control over visual properties.

Result: VLMs can match or surpass specialized counting architectures, with improved enumeration accuracy when generating intermediate representations. However, they struggle with complex scenes.

Conclusion: VLMs show potential for object counting but are not yet reliable for complex visual environments, highlighting the need for continued research.

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

### [105] [MMMamba: A Versatile Cross-Modal In Context Fusion Framework for Pan-Sharpening and Zero-Shot Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15261)
*Yingying Wang,Xuanhua He,Chen Wu,Jialing Huang,Suiyun Zhang,Rui Liu,Xinghao Ding,Haoxuan Che*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMMamba, a new pan-sharpening framework based on the Mamba architecture, ensuring efficient cross-modal fusion with high computational efficiency and delivering superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional CNN-based and cross-attention methods in effective pan-sharpening fusion and adapt to diverse spatial and spectral variations efficiently.

Method: Proposed a cross-modal in-context fusion framework (MMMamba) using the MMDiT architecture with novel multimodal interleaved scanning to ensure efficient information exchange between PAN and MS modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments confirmed that MMMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMMamba is a highly effective pan-sharpening framework that leverages efficient cross-modal in-context interaction and ensures strong performance in image processing tasks.

Abstract: Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), presenting SynthSeg Agents, a framework that generates synthetic training data without real images using large language and vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce dependence on real-world annotated images in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby making the process more cost-efficient and scalable while still achieving competitive results.

Method: The proposed framework, SynthSeg Agents, uses two modules: a Self Refine Prompt Agent for creating diverse prompts and an Image Generation Agent for synthesizing images guided by CLIP similarity scoring, combined to produce high-quality synthetic data.

Result: The SynthSeg Agents framework shows competitive results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 datasets without relying on real image supervision.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the viability of using synthetic data generated solely by LLMs and vision models for semantic segmentation, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional methods relying on real imagery.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations. While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images. SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images. This highlights the potential of LLM driven agents in enabling cost efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cross-modality distillation framework for single-panoramic-camera BEV segmentation, leveraging knowledge from LiDAR-based models to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations and high dependency on multi-sensor setups for BEV segmentation by proposing a framework that reduces sensor complexity and reliance solely on a single panoramic camera.

Method: The method includes leveraging a LiDAR-based teacher model that uses a novel LiDAR image representation fused from multiple channels, along with a voxel-aligned view transformer. The teacher distills knowledge into a student network using knowledge distillation tailored for panoramic camera inputs.

Result: The teacher model achieves a 25.6% IoU improvement on the Dur360BEV dataset over existing methods, while the distilled student achieves an 8.5% IoU gain with state-of-the-art 31.2 FPS inference speed. The framework generalizes effectively across diverse camera setups such as KITTI-360.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient, low-cost, and practical solution for BEV segmentation in autonomous driving, reducing the need for complex and costly multi-sensor configurations.

Abstract: We present the first cross-modality distillation framework specifically tailored for single-panoramic-camera Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation. Our approach leverages a novel LiDAR image representation fused from range, intensity and ambient channels, together with a voxel-aligned view transformer that preserves spatial fidelity while enabling efficient BEV processing. During training, a high-capacity LiDAR and camera fusion Teacher network extracts both rich spatial and semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network that relies solely on a single 360-degree panoramic camera image. Extensive experiments on the Dur360BEV dataset demonstrate that our teacher model significantly outperforms existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods, achieving a 25.6\% IoU improvement. Meanwhile, the distilled Student network attains competitive performance with an 8.5\% IoU gain and state-of-the-art inference speed of 31.2 FPS. Moreover, evaluations on KITTI-360 (two fisheye cameras) confirm that our distillation framework generalises to diverse camera setups, underscoring its feasibility and robustness. This approach reduces sensor complexity and deployment costs while providing a practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in real-world autonomous driving.

*Antony Jerald,Dattesh Shanbhag,Sudhanya Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoMAC-MRI is a framework to grade motion artifacts in MRI images with explainable and interpretable results, leveraging contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MRI image quality assessments by providing interpretable grading of motion artifacts, addressing limitations of binary assessments and reducing patient recalls.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning to derive discriminative representations of motion severity, with affinity scores quantifying proximity to specific motion grades.

Result: Demonstrated alignment of automated affinity scores with expert annotations on over 5000 brain MRI slices across various contrasts and orientations.

Conclusion: AutoMAC-MRI provides an effective and interpretable solution for automated motion artifact grading, enhancing MRI quality control and workflow optimization.

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCSNet for few-shot anomaly detection, improving performance by addressing the domain gap through prototypical learning and context-aware segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings in FSAD methods, particularly the domain gap between pre-trained representations and target scenarios, which hampers effective anomaly detection.

Method: PCSNet is composed of two sub-networks: the Prototypical Feature Adaption (PFA) to enhance feature compactness and anomaly separation, and the Context-Aware Segmentation (CAS), which uses pseudo anomalies and pixel-level techniques for anomaly localization.

Result: PCSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with AUROC scores of 94.9% and 80.2% on MVTec and MPDD datasets, respectively, in an 8-shot anomaly detection setting.

Conclusion: PCSNet effectively addresses domain gaps in FSAD, significantly improving anomaly detection performance, and shows potential for real-world applications with limited training samples.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) denotes the identification of anomalies within a target category with a limited number of normal samples. Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

### [111] [A Masked Reverse Knowledge Distillation Method Incorporating Global and Local Information for Image Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15326)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Can,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Masked Reverse Knowledge Distillation (MRKD) to address overgeneralization in anomaly detection via image and feature-level masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods for anomaly detection suffer from overgeneralization, stemming from the similarity between input and supervisory signals.

Method: MRKD uses Image-level Masking (ILM) and Feature-level Masking (FLM) to differentiate input and supervisory signals and simulate feature-level anomalies, enhancing both global and local information capture.

Result: MRKD achieves high performance on the MVTec dataset with 98.9% AU-ROC (image-level), 98.4% AU-ROC (pixel-level), and 95.3% AU-PRO.

Conclusion: MRKD effectively mitigates overgeneralization in anomaly detection and demonstrates superior performance with strong contextual representation capabilities.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.

*Parvesh Saini,Soumyadipta Maiti,Beena Rai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses a human-inspired system for accurately reading measurements (e.g., from a syringe or measuring cylinder) via computer vision and transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop robotic systems capable of mimicking human abilities in an unstructured laboratory environment, including reading measurements from various instruments for autonomous functioning.

Method: The method involves image transformations to correct orientation, reducing the area of interest, and extracting features like major markers, digits, and level indicator location to compute final readings.

Result: The system produced highly accurate readings that closely correspond with human-read values for the same instances.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mimics human-like accuracy in reading measurements, paving the way for enhanced robotic autonomy in laboratory settings.

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

*Junjie Chen,Fei Wang,Zhihao Huang,Qing Zhou,Kun Li,Dan Guo,Linfeng Zhang,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIMAR, a framework for 3D conversational head generation, aiming to improve coherence and expressiveness in dialogue modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model bidirectional conversational dynamics in 3D for applications like expressive avatars and interactive robots, overcoming the limitations of independent or non-causal frameworks which hinder temporal coherence.

Method: TIMAR combines multimodal information within conversational turns, uses turn-level causal attention for historical context integration, and employs a diffusion model to predict continuous 3D head dynamics.

Result: TIMAR significantly improves performance by reducing Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on benchmark and out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures dynamic conversational interactions, paving the way for seamless interaction in 3D conversational systems. Code will be made publicly available for further development.

Abstract: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data. The source code will be released in the GitHub repository https://github.com/CoderChen01/towards-seamleass-interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pro-GRPO optimizes generative models by addressing computational bottlenecks in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a dynamic pruning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO is limited by computational costs when using large groups, leading to inefficiency in generative model alignment.

Method: The authors introduce Pro-GRPO, which employs dynamic trajectory pruning and an Expand-and-Prune strategy to maximize diversity and reduce computational costs.

Result: Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead and improves optimization efficiency in experiments on diffusion-based and flow-based generative models.

Conclusion: Pro-GRPO demonstrates superior performance and efficiency, showcasing its general applicability for optimizing generative models.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

Motivation: To address the critical need for infrastructure inspection and maintenance by providing a dataset that supports 3D semantic segmentation of bridges, with a focus on the impact of sensor variations on performance.

Method: The authors created a dataset with high-resolution 3D scans of bridge structures, conducted semantic labeling, assessed state-of-the-art 3D deep learning models, and studied the impact of sensor domain gaps.

Result: The architectures tested demonstrated robust performance, but domain gaps caused by sensor variability led to a performance decline of up to 11.4% mIoU.

Conclusion: The dataset supports advancements in automated bridge monitoring, but sensor variations highlight the need for improved domain gap handling in 3D segmentation.

Abstract: We propose a novel dataset that has been specifically designed for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges and the domain gap analysis caused by varying sensors. This addresses a critical need in the field of infrastructure inspection and maintenance, which is essential for modern society. The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, we present data acquired through diverse sensors to quantify the domain gap resulting from sensor variations. Our findings indicate that all architectures demonstrate robust performance on the specified task. However, the domain gap can potentially lead to a decline in the performance of up to 11.4% mIoU.

TL;DR: The paper develops methods for emotion recognition in Japanese Sign Language (JSL) and establishes a new dataset, eJSL, alongside employing British Sign Language datasets for improved recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address the overlap between grammatical and affective facial expressions in sign languages and the lack of adequate data for emotion recognition model training.

Method: The research uses a new eJSL dataset consisting of 1,092 labeled video clips of Japanese Sign Language signers and applies techniques like textual emotion recognition, temporal segment selection, and hand motion analysis to address challenges.

Result: The study demonstrates that spoken language textual analysis helps mitigate data scarcity for sign languages, and that hand motion and temporal segmentation improve recognition accuracy. A stronger baseline surpassing spoken language-based approaches is established.

Conclusion: This work advances emotion recognition in sign languages by leveraging multi-lingual datasets and multimodal cues, addressing both limited data issues and sign language-specific challenges.

Abstract: Recognition of signers' emotions suffers from one theoretical challenge and one practical challenge, namely, the overlap between grammatical and affective facial expressions and the scarcity of data for model training. This paper addresses these two challenges in a cross-lingual setting using our eJSL dataset, a new benchmark dataset for emotion recognition in Japanese Sign Language signers, and BOBSL, a large British Sign Language dataset with subtitles. In eJSL, two signers expressed 78 distinct utterances with each of seven different emotional states, resulting in 1,092 video clips. We empirically demonstrate that 1) textual emotion recognition in spoken language mitigates data scarcity in sign language, 2) temporal segment selection has a significant impact, and 3) incorporating hand motion enhances emotion recognition in signers. Finally we establish a stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

*Arnau Barrera Roy,Albert Clapés Sintes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper focuses on action anticipation in basketball videos, particularly in predicting rebound possession.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automated sports analytics by targeting the overlooked task of action anticipation in basketball games.

Method: Introduces a new basketball dataset with 100,000 clips and applies state-of-the-art deep learning methods for action anticipation tasks.

Result: Reports baseline results and explores rebound prediction, classification, and spotting, showcasing dataset versatility and predictive modeling challenges.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the potential of action anticipation for sports analytics and real-time applications like automated broadcasting.

Abstract: Computer vision and video understanding have transformed sports analytics by enabling large-scale, automated analysis of game dynamics from broadcast footage. Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces the SMART model for partially view-aligned clustering, addressing challenges in leveraging unaligned data and overcoming cross-view distributional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view clustering approaches struggle to handle unaligned data effectively and deal with distributional shifts in multi-view representations, impairing learning accuracy.

Method: The proposed model, SMART, employs semantic matching contrastive learning to minimize the effects of cross-view distributional shifts and better exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmark datasets reveal that SMART consistently outperforms existing methods in the partially view-aligned clustering (PVC) task.

Conclusion: SMART provides a robust solution for PVC, demonstrating superior performance by addressing key challenges in multi-view clustering, including handling unaligned data and cross-view distribution issues.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has been empirically shown to improve learning performance by leveraging the inherent complementary information across multiple views of data. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) which outperforms traditional early-fusion CNN models in multiplexed tissue imaging, highlighting the inefficacy of early marker fusion for preserving marker-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current deep learning models in multiplexed tissue imaging, which often assume shared structures across channels and struggle in preserving marker-specific information, especially for rare cells.

Method: The study introduces channel-independent architectures, primarily the CIM-S model, and evaluates its performance against early-fusion CNNs using self-supervised representation learning on a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 49 and 18 markers, respectively.

Result: The CIM-S model achieved better representation learning compared to early-fusion CNNs, showing superior performance in retaining marker-specific information and rare-cell discrimination, despite its compact size of just 5.5K parameters.

Conclusion: Lightweight, channel-independent architectures like CIM-S offer a more effective approach for representation learning in multiplex data, surpassing traditional and foundation models while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

Motivation: Address the challenge of efficiently acquiring reliable training data for multimodal large language models in GUI automation and facilitate real-world deployment.

Method: A self-evolving training pipeline with Calibrated Step Reward System for high-quality annotations. It introduces Step-GUI models, GUI-MCP protocol, and a benchmark called AndroidDaily.

Result: Step-GUI models achieve state-of-the-art performance in GUI automation, with >90% annotation accuracy at significantly lower costs, and robust capabilities demonstrated on AndroidDaily benchmark.

Conclusion: The research advances GUI automation by enabling practical deployment through innovative models, efficient training pipelines, privacy-preserving protocols, and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

### [121] [CLIP-FTI: Fine-Grained Face Template Inversion via CLIP-Driven Attribute Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15433)
*Longchen Dai,Zixuan Shen,Zhiheng Zhou,Peipeng Yu,Zhihua Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CLIP-FTI, a framework for face template inversion that combines semantic embeddings from the CLIP model and StyleGAN to reconstruct facial images with higher accuracy and finer attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face template leaks can compromise privacy and security by enabling realistic impersonation. Traditional inversion methods face challenges in reconstructing fine-grained facial attributes, motivating improved solutions.

Method: CLIP-FTI integrates CLIP-extracted semantic facial feature embeddings with leaked templates through a cross-modal feature interaction network. The fused data is then utilized by StyleGAN to generate high-quality reconstructed images.

Result: The approach improves identification accuracy, attribute similarity, semantic sharpness of facial components, and cross-model attack transferability, achieving state-of-the-art results for face template inversion.

Conclusion: CLIP-FTI significantly enhances face template inversion capability, presenting a novel and more effective method for reconstructing recognizable and fine-detailed facial images.

Abstract: Face recognition systems store face templates for efficient matching. Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.

*Yueqianji Chen,Kevin Williams,John H. Doonan,Paolo Remagnino,Jo Hepworth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ST-DETrack, a neural network for tracking plant branches in time-series imagery with high accuracy, addressing challenges like growth dynamics and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking individual plant branches over time is complicated due to non-rigid growth and occlusions, but is crucial for high-throughput phenotyping.

Method: The paper proposes a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network combining spatial and temporal cues with adaptive gating and biological constraints to enhance tracking accuracy.

Result: The model achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6% on a Brassica napus dataset, outperforming spatial and temporal baselines significantly.

Conclusion: ST-DETrack effectively maintains branch identity in dynamic canopies, proving its potential for automated plant phenotype analysis.

Abstract: Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is essential for high-throughput phenotyping, yet it remains computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies. To overcome these stage-dependent ambiguities, we propose ST-DETrack, a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network designed to preserve branch identity from budding to flowering. Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate the method's robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how vision-text compression (VTC) affects long-context understanding in vision-language models (VLMs), introducing the first benchmark to systematically evaluate this capability, uncovering limitations in current VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in understanding how VLMs handle highly compressed, dense VTC information, impacting their long-context capabilities despite the potential of VTC for scaling up context windows.

Method: Introduces the first benchmark for VTC performance (including settings for retrieval, reasoning, and memory) and evaluates VLMs using diverse input simulations through the VTCBench-Wild framework.

Result: Finds that current VLMs struggle with long-context understanding in VTC-compressed data, despite performing well in basic decoding tasks like OCR.

Conclusion: This study highlights the limitations of existing VLMs in handling long-context capabilities post-VTC compression and sets the groundwork for developing more robust, scalable VLMs.

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

TL;DR: This study evaluates and compares the performance of ResNet-101 and Inception v3 models for wildlife object detection under challenging environmental conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance biodiversity conservation efforts by evaluating effective deep learning methods for wildlife object detection, addressing challenges like visual similarities and environmental variability.

Method: The study utilized ResNet-101 and Inception v3 models, trained on a wildlife image dataset with standardized preprocessing. The process involved resizing images, color conversion, and data transformation, with a 70:30 training-validation split.

Result: ResNet-101 achieved 94% accuracy and 0.91 mAP, while Inception v3 achieved 95% accuracy and 0.92 mAP. Both faced difficulties with visually similar species and poor lighting conditions.

Conclusion: Both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 models were effective and provide a solid foundation for wildlife detection and conservation-related applications, though challenges persist in specific scenarios.

Abstract: Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.

### [125] [RUMPL: Ray-Based Transformers for Universal Multi-View 2D to 3D Human Pose Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15488)
*Seyed Abolfazl Ghasemzadeh,Alexandre Alahi,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter for accurate 3D human pose estimation, overcoming challenges like occlusions, projective ambiguity, and limited training datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in estimating 3D human poses due to occlusions, projective ambiguity, and the lack of large-scale multi-view datasets, as well as poor generalization of existing methods to real-world scenarios.

Method: The RUMPL framework uses a transformer-based approach with a novel 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints, enabling calibration and view independence. It includes a View Fusion Transformer that aggregates information from multiple views for enhanced performance.

Result: RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to image-representation transformer models. It performs robustly across new in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets.

Conclusion: RUMPL offers a robust, scalable, and universal solution for 3D pose estimation without the need for camera calibration or retraining. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results and adaptability in real-world settings.

Abstract: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

*Rohit Jena,Pratik Chaudhari,James C. Gee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper re-evaluates claims about deep learning's zero-shot performance in the LUMIR challenge, highlighting limitations and issues with generalization, scalability, and preprocessing sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically assess the zero-shot generalization claims of deep learning-based deformable image registration methods in neuroimaging, which conflict with known domain shift challenges.

Method: The study uses rigorous evaluation protocols to test deep learning methods against iterative optimization on in-distribution and out-of-distribution imaging contrasts and resolutions.

Result: Key findings include comparable performance on in-distribution data, significant degradation on out-of-distribution contrasts, scalability issues with high-resolution data for deep methods, and high sensitivity to preprocessing.

Conclusion: Current claims about deep learning’s universal zero-shot superiority are overstated. Careful evaluation aligned with realistic clinical workflows is necessary to ensure reliability and practicality.

Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

*Arthur Moreau,Richard Shaw,Michal Nazarczuk,Jisu Shin,Thomas Tanay,Zhensong Zhang,Songcen Xu,Eduardo Pérez-Pellitero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an improved feed-forward model for real-time 3D scene generation using adaptive 3D Gaussian primitive placement instead of a pixel-aligned grid, achieving better quality and efficiency in scene synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting models are constrained by rigid pixel-aligned grids, resulting in suboptimal quality and performance. There is a need for a more efficient and accurate method to allocate Gaussian primitives.

Method: The authors propose a feed-forward architecture that utilizes an adaptive, off-grid distribution of 3D Gaussian primitives. A multi-resolution decoder detects sub-pixel primitives, trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning.

Result: The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for feed-forward methods, generating photorealistic scenes with fewer primitives. It improves scene quality, reduces artifacts, and enhances camera pose estimation without requiring labels.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that adaptive placement of 3D Gaussian primitives results in both efficiency and quality gains for 3D scene synthesis. The model also has potential for label-free training of foundational models like camera pose estimation.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a framework addressing challenges in verifying AI-generated images' authenticity by providing accurate and interpretable anomaly scoring through Vision Transformers and SegFormer embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of AI-generated images necessitates robust tools to detect forgeries, especially since modern methods evade traditional pixel/compression artifact-based detectors.

Method: VAAS combines global anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers and patch-level analysis with SegFormer embeddings to deliver a hybrid model for anomaly scoring.

Result: VAAS demonstrated competitive performance metrics (F1 and IoU) on DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets, while showcasing improved visual explainability using anomaly maps.

Conclusion: VAAS effectively bridges the gap between quantitative detection and human-understandable reasoning, offering transparent support in assessing image integrity.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeX-Portrait introduces a method for realistic and expressive portrait animation by disentangling head pose and facial expression controls, outperforming prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the lack of disentangled control in diffusion models for pose and expression in portrait animation, which hindered specific editing and animation applications.

Method: The approach involves learning decomposed driving signals for pose and expression through dedicated encoders, utilizing a dual-branch conditioning mechanism for pose transformation injection, cross attention for expression, and progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for identity consistency.

Result: The proposed approach achieves higher animation quality and better disentangled control compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DeX-Portrait enables more accurate and versatile portrait animation by offering disentangled pose-expression control, advancing current generation methods.

Abstract: Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC), which enhances reliability by verbalizing confidence in its emotion predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing MLLM-based VEC systems that treat emotion prediction as a deterministic task, overlooking the inherent subjectivity and multiple plausible interpretations of emotions in images.

Method: The proposed method includes a three-stage training framework: structured reasoning, teaching confidence verbalization, and calibrating confidence expressions, resulting in the development of EmoCaliber.

Result: EmoCaliber outperforms existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation on VECBench, a unified benchmark for VEC.

Conclusion: The study validates that equipping VEC systems with confidence-awareness improves reliability and represents significant progress toward robust VEC solutions.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address multiple tasks in remote sensing using Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs), despite their high computational cost, inspired this work.

Method: The study proposes an encoder-only model architecture called GeoMELT to handle multi-task learning (e.g., text generation from images and cross-modal retrieval) efficiently.

Result: GeoMELT achieves effective results on remote sensing benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy and reduced computational demands.

Conclusion: GeoMELT successfully tackles remote sensing multi-task learning challenges while remaining computationally efficient and parameter-compact.

Abstract: The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, necessitates robust anonymization methods to protect privacy while maintaining essential visual information.

Method: BLANKET involves a two-stage process: generating a random face via inpainting with a diffusion model and ensuring temporal consistency through face swapping and expression transfer across video frames.

Result: BLANKET outperforms the existing method, DeepPrivacy2, in preserving facial attributes, achieving better de-identification, minimizing artifacts, and maintaining quality for downstream tasks like human pose estimation.

Conclusion: BLANKET provides an effective solution for anonymizing video data of infants, balancing privacy and utility. The code is freely available for use.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects.

Method: The authors propose a text-only benchmark (TED-6K) for efficient evaluation and a two-stage training paradigm that refines text encoders via fine-tuning on multimodal models and layer-wise weighting.

Result: GRAN-TED achieves state-of-the-art results on the TED-6K benchmark and improves performance in text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks.

Conclusion: The development of the GRAN-TED encoder and the TED-6K benchmark provide effective tools for advancing text-to-visual generation capabilities. Their methods substantially improve semantic quality in downstream tasks.

Abstract: The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

### [134] [On the Effectiveness of Textual Prompting with Lightweight Fine-Tuning for SAM3 Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15564)
*Roni Blushtein-Livnon,Osher Rafaeli,David Ioffe,Amir Boger,Karen Sandberg Esquenazi,Tal Svoray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates SAM3's mask generation capabilities for RS image segmentation using textual, geometric, and hybrid prompts, highlighting performance variations and challenges with fine-tuning under limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited annotated data and semantic differences between RS images and natural imagery foundational models. By using SAM3 for efficient adaptation in RS image tasks.

Method: SAM3's concept-driven framework is employed with strategies that include textual, geometric, and hybrid prompts, assessed under different levels of fine-tuning supervision and zero-shot inference.

Result: Hybrid cues outperform textual-only prompting, yielding maximum segmentation efficacy. Fine-tuning improves performance, but additional supervision offers diminishing returns. Precision gaps usually reflect issues like under-segmentation and inaccurate boundaries, especially for irregular targets.

Conclusion: SAM3 provides effective segmentation improvement using minimal geometric annotations, with hybrid prompting as the most promising strategy. Nevertheless, accuracy issues persist for complex RS targets.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoonSeg3R for online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, leveraging geometric priors from single RGB streams and methods to improve temporal consistency and frame fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail at online 3D instance segmentation because they depend on posed RGB-D sequences, a limitation that this paper aims to address by using a monocular RGB approach.

Method: MoonSeg3R introduces self-supervised query refinement, 3D query index memory, and state-distribution tokens to transform 2D segmentation into 3D queries and ensure temporal consistency.

Result: The method is the first to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and performs competitively with RGB-D-based systems in ScanNet200 and SceneNN benchmarks.

Conclusion: MoonSeg3R makes online monocular 3D instance segmentation possible using geometric priors and novel 3D query techniques, achieving competitive results with RGB-D systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems. Code and models will be released.

### [136] [IMKD: Intensity-Aware Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation for Camera-Radar Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15581)
*Shashank Mishra,Karan Patil,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework using multi-level knowledge distillation, achieving superior 3D object detection without LiDAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of radar-camera 3D object detection cause distortions by transferring modality-specific features directly to sensors. The authors aim to address this limitation by preserving intrinsic characteristics of each sensor while enhancing their complementary strengths.

Method: IMKD employs a three-stage intensity-aware distillation strategy: 1) LiDAR-to-Radar distillation enhances radar structural cues, 2) LiDAR-to-Fused intensity guidance improves depth and complementarity, and 3) Camera-Radar fusion aligns features effectively.

Result: IMKD achieves 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP on the nuScenes benchmark, surpassing all previous distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

Conclusion: The proposed IMKD method advances radar-camera 3D object detection by ensuring complementary sensor integration while avoiding distortions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

TL;DR: FlexAvatar introduces a method for creating high-quality 3D head avatars from a single image, overcoming issues in view extrapolation through a novel transformer-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of incomplete 3D head reconstructions and the limited availability of multi-view data in the field of head avatar creation from monocular images.

Method: FlexAvatar proposes a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model using learnable bias sinks to combine monocular and multi-view datasets during training. This approach blends the generalization ability from monocular data with the full 3D completeness of multi-view data.

Result: FlexAvatar effectively generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations, overcoming view extrapolation struggles in the evaluations on various tasks like single-view and few-shot avatar creation.

Conclusion: FlexAvatar demonstrates itself as a robust method for creating high-quality, smooth 3D avatars from monocular inputs, enabling new capabilities in identity interpolation and model fitting.

Abstract: We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: https://tobias-kirschstein.github.io/flexavatar/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Qwen-Image-Layered, a diffusion model for decomposing RGB images into editable RGBA layers, enabling isolated edits without compromising image consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address consistency issues in image editing using visual generative models, inspired by the layered editing style in professional design tools.

Method: They propose an RGBA-based decomposition model incorporating RGBA-VAE, VLD-MMDiT architecture, and multi-stage training for adaptive layer decomposition. Additionally, they create a pipeline to annotate multilayer images from Photoshop files.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms existing decomposition approaches and achieves high-quality, editable multilayer images.

Conclusion: The study establishes a new approach for consistent image editing with layered representations, significantly improving decomposition accuracy and editability.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

*Johannes Hägerlind,Bao-Long Tran,Urs Waldmann,Per-Erik Forssén*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a robust method for pose estimation and camera calibration, achieving notable accuracy improvements, particularly for cameras with strong radial distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in camera pose estimation and calibration, specifically for setups involving rigid cameras used in animal behavior and forensic analysis.

Method: The authors analyze structure-from-motion (SfM) components, optimize design choices including correspondence subsampling and incremental view addition, and evaluate improvements with rigorous experiments.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant accuracy improvements (e.g., 79.9% accuracy vs. 40.4% for the baseline with strong radial distortion). It also generalizes well for diverse camera setups.

Conclusion: This method advances the field by addressing known challenges in SfM and could serve as a valuable tool for applications like animal behavior and forensic studies.

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

*Morgan Coe,Gruffudd Jones,Leah-Nani Alconcel,Marina Gashinova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sub-THz ISAR imaging system to detect and track external structures on satellites for Space Domain Awareness, using methods like Hough transform and feature tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of resident space objects necessitates detailed inspections to enhance Space Domain Awareness, particularly using space-based sensing systems.

Method: Sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) is employed for imaging satellites, incorporating gradient-based edge detection, affine transformations, and a double-weighted Hough transform for feature recognition.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated increased confidence in feature detection, classification, and robust detection of shadowing as a feature within ISAR images.

Conclusion: Tracking features across sequential ISAR images improves recognition and enhances reliable classification of satellite structures, supporting Space Domain Awareness advancements.

Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.

*Yu Zheng,Jie Hu,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing OccSTeP, a concept for 4D spatio-temporal understanding in autonomous driving, addressing reactive and proactive scene forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous driving systems by providing robust and comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes, particularly under challenging conditions.

Method: Developed a tokenizer-free model, OccSTeP-WM, that uses voxel-based scene state, spatio-temporal fusion, and long-range spatial attention.

Result: OccSTeP-WM achieves significant improvements in semantic mIoU (+6.56%) and occupancy IoU (+9.26%) compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The OccSTeP concept and model demonstrate robust and effective forecasting capabilities in 4D scene understanding for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AllSky, a novel model for generating flexible, photorealistic, and user-controllable outdoor sky maps using physically captured HDRI, improving upon the limitations of existing sky-models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN-generated sky models and HDRI methods cannot adequately recreate natural skies with accurate illumination, tones, and shadows for photorealistic rendering under all weather conditions.

Method: The AllSky model is directly trained on physically captured HDRI and allows intuitive user control over sun and cloud positioning while providing support for full 22 f-stop dynamic range outdoor illumination.

Result: AllSky achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing sky-models in photorealism, flexibility, and scalability, while enabling accurate environmental illumination for downstream applications.

Conclusion: AllSky bridges gaps between DNN-generated and physically captured HDRI, offering a more accurate and user-controllable solution for creating natural and visually coherent outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component for rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications

TL;DR: The paper introduces IC-Effect, a DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that ensures spatial and temporal consistency while adding complex effects like flames and particles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video VFX editing struggles with integrating effects seamlessly while preserving backgrounds and learning from limited data, something existing models fail to achieve.

Method: IC-Effect employs a DiT-based model, two-stage training (general adaptation plus Effect-LoRA), and spatiotemporal sparse tokenization to efficiently ensure consistent and high-quality video edits.

Result: IC-Effect demonstrates superior VFX editing via improved background preservation, natural effect integration, and editing efficiency on a new paired editing dataset.

Conclusion: IC-Effect offers a controllable, high-quality, and temporally consistent solution for video VFX editing, expanding creative possibilities in video production.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

*Qirui Li,Yizhe Tang,Ran Yi,Guangben Lu,Fangyuan Zou,Peng Shu,Huan Yu,Jie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses spatial relationship hallucinations in foreground-conditioned inpainting. It proposes InpaintDPO, a method ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background via optimized strategies like MaskDPO, Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, and Shared Commonality Preference Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foreground-conditioned inpainting methods struggle with spatial relationship hallucinations, leading to unrealistic spatial relationships between foreground and background objects. Additionally, subjective spatial rationality makes it difficult to quantify and address using traditional methods.

Method: The proposed InpaintDPO framework includes:
1. MaskDPO: Confines preference optimization to the background to resolve gradient conflicts.
2. Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization: Enhances coherence at the foreground-background boundary via global preference optimization.
3. Shared Commonality Preference Optimization: Improves the model's understanding of shared spatial rationality in winning samples.

Result: The framework effectively addresses spatial rationality issues, reducing spatial relationship hallucinations and improving harmony between foreground and background in generated images.

Conclusion: InpaintDPO introduces novel optimization techniques that significantly enhance spatial rationality and contextual coherence in foreground-conditioned inpainting, improving the realism and harmony of generated images.

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.

### [145] [Hard Labels In! Rethinking the Role of Hard Labels in Mitigating Local Semantic Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15647)
*Jiacheng Cui,Bingkui Tong,Xinyue Bi,Xiaohan Zhao,Jiacheng Liu,Zhiqiang shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper revisits the use of hard labels in training, proposing a method called HALD to mitigate local semantic drift in soft-label-based training. It shows consistent improvements in various benchmarks, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of local semantic drift in soft label-based knowledge transfer where crops from images often lose alignment with their global semantic meaning, introducing errors during training and testing.

Method: The authors introduce HALD (Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift), which integrates hard labels as corrective signals to counteract semantic drift while preserving the advantages of soft labels.

Result: Through experiments on dataset distillation and classification tasks, HALD demonstrates consistent improvements. On ImageNet-1K, it achieves 42.7% accuracy using only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 9.0%.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the complementary role of hard labels in soft-label training, showing that leveraging them can significantly enhance model generalization and performance.

Abstract: Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat the vulnerability of deep vision models to common signal corruptions by improving data augmentation techniques.

Method: A training pipeline using a combination of stylized (via neural style transfer) synthetic images and traditional data augmentation techniques to bolster image classifier robustness.

Result: The method achieves significant state-of-the-art robustness on benchmarks like CIFAR-10-C (93.54%), CIFAR-100-C (74.9%), and TinyImageNet-C (50.86%).

Conclusion: Stylized synthetic data complements traditional augmentation methods, offering improved robustness against corruptions for image classifiers.

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Method: Skyra is built using a two-stage training process, leveraging a novel dataset, ViF-CoT-4K, and evaluated on a new benchmark, ViF-Bench, for comprehensive performance testing.

Result: Skyra outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks in both detection and explanation of AI-generated videos.

Conclusion: Skyra represents a significant advance in explaining and detecting AI-generated videos, benefiting both research and practical applications.

Abstract: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

### [148] [VLIC: Vision-Language Models As Perceptual Judges for Human-Aligned Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15701)
*Kyle Sargent,Ruiqi Gao,Philipp Henzler,Charles Herrmann,Aleksander Holynski,Li Fei-Fei,Jiajun Wu,Jason Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes VLIC, a diffusion-based image compression system leveraging vision-language models' (VLMs) zero-shot reasoning capabilities, achieving competitive performance in human-aligned visual compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distortion metrics like MSE fail to align well with human perception in image compression, necessitating better perceptual alignment methods.

Method: The authors utilize state-of-the-art vision-language models for zero-shot reasoning and propose VLIC, a compression model trained directly on VLM-generated binary judgments using diffusion model post-training techniques.

Result: The proposed system demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance in perceptual metrics and user studies, depending on the dataset.

Conclusion: Vision-language models can effectively align image compression processes with human perception, providing insights into reward design and training with VLM judgments.

Abstract: Evaluations of image compression performance which include human preferences have generally found that naive distortion functions such as MSE are insufficiently aligned to human perception. In order to align compression models to human perception, prior work has employed differentiable perceptual losses consisting of neural networks calibrated on large-scale datasets of human psycho-visual judgments. We show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can replicate binary human two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) judgments zero-shot when asked to reason about the differences between pairs of images. Motivated to exploit the powerful zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we propose Vision-Language Models for Image Compression (VLIC), a diffusion-based image compression system designed to be post-trained with binary VLM judgments. VLIC leverages existing techniques for diffusion model post-training with preferences, rather than distilling the VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss network. We show that calibrating this system on VLM judgments produces competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression depending on the dataset, according to perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. We additionally conduct an extensive analysis of the VLM-based reward design and training procedure and share important insights. More visuals are available at https://kylesargent.github.io/vlic

*Yuwei Guo,Ceyuan Yang,Hao He,Yang Zhao,Meng Wei,Zhenheng Yang,Weilin Huang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Resampling Forcing, a framework for training autoregressive video models from scratch, addressing exposure bias by simulating model errors during training and achieving strong performance over long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of exposure bias in autoregressive video diffusion models caused by train-test mismatch, which limits their utility in long-horizon generation tasks.

Method: Proposes Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free training framework featuring self-resampling for simulating inference errors, a sparse causal mask for enforcing temporal causality, and history routing to dynamically retrieve key history frames efficiently.

Result: The method achieves performance on par with distillation-based models while showing improved temporal consistency for longer videos due to native-length training.

Conclusion: Resampling Forcing offers an end-to-end solution for training autoregressive video models with enhanced temporal consistency and scalability for longer video generation tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.

*Yu Wang,Juhyung Ha,Frangil M. Ramirez,Yuchen Wang,David J. Crandall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GateFusion is an advanced Active Speaker Detection model combining strong unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder for improved cross-modal interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional late fusion approaches for Active Speaker Detection often fail to capture detailed cross-modal interactions, which limits their performance in diverse and unconstrained environments.

Method: The paper introduces GateFusion, utilizing a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate) that adaptively fuses multimodal features across Transformer layers, aided by Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP).

Result: GateFusion achieves state-of-the-art mAP results on several ASD benchmarks (Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, WASD), demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements and showing generalization in out-of-domain experiments.

Conclusion: GateFusion's architecture effectively enhances multimodal learning, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in Active Speaker Detection tasks.

Abstract: Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

### [151] [Multi-View Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15708)
*Leo Segre,Or Hirschorn,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitation of current foundation models in producing consistent features across multiple views of a 3D scene by proposing a method to augment these models into Multi-View Foundation Models using 3D-aware attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models, while effective for single images, fail to ensure consistent feature representations across multiple views of the same 3D scene, necessitating a solution for multi-view consistency.

Method: The study introduces 3D-aware attention layers to existing Transformers-based foundation models (like DINO, SAM, CLIP), enabling them to process multi-view inputs and output consistent feature maps for corresponding 3D points.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances feature matching across different views compared to traditional foundation models, as demonstrated in tasks like surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation.

Conclusion: Transformers-based foundation models can be augmented to handle multi-view scenarios effectively, providing more consistent feature representations without requiring full 3D model reconstruction.

Abstract: Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.

TL;DR: GPiCA introduces a hybrid representation combining triangle mesh and anisotropic 3D Gaussians to create efficient and photorealistic head avatars that can be rendered on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create photorealistic head avatars that are both computationally efficient and capable of being rendered on resource-limited devices like mobile phones.

Method: The approach combines triangle meshes for efficient surface representation and 3D Gaussians for non-surface features, with a unified differentiable rendering pipeline for training neural networks to generate avatars from multi-view images.

Result: GPiCA achieves the realism of Gaussian-based avatars while maintaining the rendering efficiency of mesh-based models.

Conclusion: GPiCA successfully balances high realism and efficient rendering, making it well-suited for use in mobile devices.

Abstract: We present Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA), photorealistic head avatars that can be generated from multi-view images and efficiently rendered on mobile devices. GPiCA utilizes a unique hybrid representation that combines a triangle mesh and anisotropic 3D Gaussians. This combination maximizes memory and rendering efficiency while maintaining a photorealistic appearance. The triangle mesh is highly efficient in representing surface areas like facial skin, while the 3D Gaussians effectively handle non-surface areas such as hair and beard. To this end, we develop a unified differentiable rendering pipeline that treats the mesh as a semi-transparent layer within the volumetric rendering paradigm of 3D Gaussian Splatting. We train neural networks to decode a facial expression code into three components: a 3D face mesh, an RGBA texture, and a set of 3D Gaussians. These components are rendered simultaneously in a unified rendering engine. The networks are trained using multi-view image supervision. Our results demonstrate that GPiCA achieves the realism of purely Gaussian-based avatars while matching the rendering performance of mesh-based avatars.

*Lunbin Zeng,Jingfeng Yao,Bencheng Liao,Hongyuan Tao,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiffusionVL, a diffusion vision language model (dVLM), which is converted from autoregressive (AR) models for multimodal tasks, showing notable performance and speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether existing powerful AR models can be translated into effective diffusion-based vision language models, addressing the limitations of base diffusion language models in dVLMs.

Method: The authors propose DiffusionVL, a family of dVLMs derived from AR models via simple fine-tuning. They also introduce a block-decoding design for arbitrary-length generation and inference speed enhancement.

Result: DiffusionVL achieves a 34.4% improvement on the MMMU-Pro benchmark (vision) and a 37.5% improvement on the MME (Cognition) benchmark, using less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, with a 2x inference speedup.

Conclusion: DiffusionVL successfully demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of converting AR models into diffusion-based dVLMs, offering substantial performance gains and efficiency improvements, thereby advancing multimodal research.

Abstract: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Pixio', an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE), showcasing pixel-space self-supervised learning that performs competitively across various downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the relevance and competitiveness of pixel-based representations for self-supervised learning in downstream tasks, addressing the need for simplicity, stability, and efficiency.

Method: Develops 'Pixio', an enhanced masked autoencoder trained on 2 billion web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy and more challenging pre-training tasks for stronger representation.

Result: 'Pixio' performs competitively across tasks like monocular depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, semantic segmentation, and robot learning, matching or outperforming DINOv3.

Conclusion: Pixel-based self-supervised learning remains relevant and competitive, offering a promising alternative or complement to latent-space approaches for a variety of tasks.

Abstract: At the most basic level, pixels are the source of the visual information through which we perceive the world. Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatia, a video generation framework using 3D scene memory to address spatial and temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the complexity of video signals.

Method: Spatia maintains a 3D scene point cloud as spatial memory, updates it via visual SLAM, and uses it to iteratively generate and enhance video clips.

Result: The proposed framework improves spatial consistency in video generation while supporting advanced features like camera control and interactive editing.

Conclusion: Spatia offers a geometrically grounded, scalable approach to video generation with better spatial coherence and additional interactive capabilities.

Abstract: Existing video generation models struggle to maintain long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the dense, high-dimensional nature of video signals. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spatial memory and continuously updates it through visual SLAM. This dynamic-static disentanglement design enhances spatial consistency throughout the generation process while preserving the model's ability to produce realistic dynamic entities. Furthermore, Spatia enables applications such as explicit camera control and 3D-aware interactive editing, providing a geometrically grounded framework for scalable, memory-driven video generation.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper examines the factors beyond raw network bandwidth that impact high-performance data transfer, identifying bottlenecks such as host-side constraints and network latency, emphasizing the need for holistic co-design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete view that high-speed network provision alone ensures effective data transfer performance and explore broader bottlenecks affecting real-world data movement workflows.

Method: Investigated six paradigms using a latency-emulation testbed and conducted extensive measurements across edge environments and an operational 100 Gbps link between Switzerland and California.

Result: Findings reveal that bottlenecks primarily arise outside the network core, including host-side and software issues. Holistic hardware-software co-design aids consistent performance across diverse workflows.

Conclusion: A holistic approach that integrates hardware and software properly bridges gaps between benchmarks and real production environments, ensuring optimal data transfer performance.

Abstract: The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, and international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete, equating provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities across the entire edge-to-core spectrum. This paper investigates six common paradigms, from the often-cited constraints of network latency and TCP congestion control algorithms to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization that critically impact data movement workflows. We validated our findings using a latency-emulation-capable testbed for high-speed WAN performance prediction and through extensive production measurements from resource-constrained edge environments to a 100 Gbps operational link connecting Switzerland and California, U.S. These results show that the principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design ensures consistent performance, whether moving data at 1 Gbps or 100 Gbps and faster. This approach effectively closes the fidelity gap between benchmark results and diverse and complex production environments.

Motivation: Enable training of medium-sized language models on commodity GPUs with constraints like low memory and slower communication, making advanced model training accessible to non-datacenter environments.

Method: Introduced optimizations like activation checkpointing, offloading, and copy-engine based collectives in an 8-bit training pipeline using CUDA/C++ to enhance memory and processing efficiency for commodity GPUs.

Result: LLMQ can train a 7B model on a 16GB gaming GPU or a 32B model on 4 RTX 4090s with around 50% FLOP utilization, achieving competitive performance with high-cost cloud GPU systems.

Conclusion: LLMQ demonstrates that medium-scale language models can be efficiently trained on affordable and widely available GPU hardware, closing the gap in accessibility and performance between gaming and datacenter-grade GPUs.

Abstract: We present LLMQ, an end-to-end CUDA/C++ implementation for medium-sized language-model training, e.g. 3B to 32B parameters, on affordable, commodity GPUs. These devices are characterized by low memory availability and slow communication compared to datacentre-grade GPUs. Consequently, we showcase a range of optimizations that target these bottlenecks, including activation checkpointing, offloading, and copy-engine based collectives. LLMQ is able to train or fine-tune a 7B model on a single 16GB mid-range gaming card, or a 32B model on a workstation equipped with 4 RTX 4090s. This is achieved while executing a standard 8-bit training pipeline, without additional algorithmic approximations, and maintaining FLOP utilization of around 50%. The efficiency of LLMQ rivals that of production-scale systems on much more expensive cloud-grade GPUs.

*Daniel Jünger,Kevin Kristensen,Yunsong Wang,Xiangyao Yu,Bertil Schmidt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper explores GPU-optimized Bloom filter implementations for high-speed and accurate approximate membership queries, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in GPU-optimized implementations of Bloom filters, as most studies have focused on CPU-based designs despite GPUs offering high parallelism and memory bandwidth.

Method: The design explores three optimization dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency on GPUs, with emphasis on configuration tuning to maximize throughput while balancing error rate and performance.

Result: The proposed GPU design achieves significant speed gains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 11.35× for filter lookup and 15.4× for filter construction while retaining high precision. It reaches over 92% of theoretical peak performance on B200 GPUs.

Conclusion: The GPU-optimized Bloom filter design breaks the typical trade-offs between speed and precision, offers modularity, and paves the way for accessible, open-source implementation for high-performance applications.

Abstract: Bloom filters are a fundamental data structure for approximate membership queries, with applications ranging from data analytics to databases and genomics. Several variants have been proposed to accommodate parallel architectures. GPUs, with massive thread-level parallelism and high-bandwidth memory, are a natural fit for accelerating these Bloom filter variants potentially to billions of operations per second. Although CPU-optimized implementations have been well studied, GPU designs remain underexplored. We close this gap by exploring the design space on GPUs along three dimensions: vectorization, thread cooperation, and compute latency.
  Our evaluation shows that the combination of these optimization points strongly affects throughput, with the largest gains achieved when the filter fits within the GPU's cache domain. We examine how the hardware responds to different parameter configurations and relate these observations to measured performance trends. Crucially, our optimized design overcomes the conventional trade-off between speed and precision, delivering the throughput typically restricted to high-error variants while maintaining the superior accuracy of high-precision configurations. At iso error rate, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by $11.35\times$ ($15.4\times$) for bulk filter lookup (construction), respectively, achieving above $92\%$ of the practical speed-of-light across a wide range of configurations on a B200 GPU. We propose a modular CUDA/C++ implementation, which will be openly available soon.

*A. Jesse Jiryu Davis,Murat Demirbas,Lingzhi Deng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces LeaseGuard, a novel algorithm that optimizes Raft-based distributed database systems, enhancing read consistency and availability with minimal communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed databases require consistent reads alongside replicating writes, but existing Raft-based systems face challenges ensuring this consistency without high communication overhead or availability sacrifices.

Method: The study proposes LeaseGuard, a lease algorithm designed with Raft election-specific guarantees, rigorously specified using TLA+. It includes optimizations to maximize failover availability by restoring write throughput quickly and improving read availability.

Result: LeaseGuard reduces consistent read overhead to zero network roundtrips, enhances write throughput from ~1,000 to ~10,000 writes/second, and drastically improves the leader's read availability during failover.

Conclusion: LeaseGuard effectively integrates into Raft systems, advancing performance and availability metrics for distributed databases compared to traditional lease protocols.

Abstract: Raft is a leading consensus algorithm for replicating writes in distributed databases. However, distributed databases also require consistent reads. To guarantee read consistency, a Raft-based system must either accept the high communication overhead of a safety check for each read, or implement leader leases. Prior lease protocols are vaguely specified and hurt availability, so most Raft systems implement them incorrectly or not at all. We introduce LeaseGuard, a novel lease algorithm that relies on guarantees specific to Raft elections. LeaseGuard is simple, rigorously specified in TLA+, and includes two novel optimizations that maximize availability during leader failover. The first optimization restores write throughput quickly, and the second improves read availability. We evaluate LeaseGuard with a simulation in Python and an implementation in LogCabin, the C++ reference implementation of Raft. By replacing LogCabin's default consistency mechanism (quorum checks), LeaseGuard reduces the overhead of consistent reads from one to zero network roundtrips. It also improves write throughput from ~1000 to ~10,000 writes per second, by eliminating contention between writes and quorum reads. Whereas traditional leases ban all reads on a new leader while it waits for a lease, in our LeaseGuard test the new leader instantly allows 99% of reads to succeed.

*Xuting Liu,Daniel Alexander,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Behnaz Arzani,Vincent Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DREX is a novel inference system for early-exit (EE) LLMs that reorganizes request batches dynamically during inference, improving throughput and preserving output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional batching frameworks struggle with handling early exits in EE LLMs, leading to either missed efficiency opportunities or degraded output quality.

Method: Dynamic Rebatching reorganizes batches dynamically by exiting processed requests immediately, buffering the rest, and forwarding them efficiently. DREX optimizes this with a copy-free buffer and a profitability-aware scheduler.

Result: DREX improves inference throughput by 2-12% compared to baselines while maintaining output quality and eliminating premature exits.

Conclusion: DREX demonstrates a robust framework for handling EE LLM inference, achieving both efficiency and quality preservation.

Abstract: Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE opportunities, or degrade output quality by forcing premature exits. We propose Dynamic Rebatching, a solution where we dynamically reorganize the batch at each early-exit point. Requests that meet the exit criteria are immediately processed, while those that continue are held in a buffer, re-grouped into a new batch, and forwarded to deeper layers. We introduce DREX, an early-exit inference system that implements Dynamic Rebatching with two key optimizations: 1) a copy-free rebatching buffer that avoids physical data movement, and 2) an EE and SLA-aware scheduler that analytically predicts whether a given rebatching operation will be profitable. DREX also efficiently handles the missing KV cache from skipped layers using memory-efficient state-copying. Our evaluation shows that DREX improves throughput by 2-12% compared to baseline approaches while maintaining output quality. Crucially, DREX completely eliminates involuntary exits, providing a key guarantee for preserving the output quality intended by the EE model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the need for human expertise or automated trial-and-error in designing deep learning architectures for image captioning.

Method: The authors propose NN-Caption, a pipeline where an LLM generates CNN and sequence decoder architectures under a strict Net API, combining prompt-based code generation, selection of hyperparameters, and iterative debugging.

Result: NN-Caption successfully generated dozens of image-captioning models, with over half being trainable and achieving meaningful captions. The best BLEU-4 score was reported, and challenges in API compliance were addressed.

Conclusion: LLM-guided neural architecture search shows potential in creating runnable deep learning models efficiently, contributing novel architectures to the LEMUR dataset for future research.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) traditionally requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error to design deep learning models. We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.

*Keqiuyin Li,Jie Lu,Hua Zuo,Guangquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method called AutoS is proposed for unsupervised multi-domain adaptation, addressing issues of irrelevant source domain data by autonomously selecting transferable knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve transfer learning performance by identifying and selecting relevant knowledge from multiple source domains, particularly in scenarios with massive-source domains.

Method: The paper introduces the AutoS method that includes a density-driven selection strategy to pick relevant source samples and models, along with a pseudo-label enhancement module to manage target label noise.

Result: Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate improved performance using the proposed AutoS method.

Conclusion: AutoS effectively enhances unsupervised multi-domain adaptation by autonomously selecting transferable source knowledge and mitigating noise in the target domain.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-domain adaptation plays a key role in transfer learning by leveraging acquired rich source information from multiple source domains to solve target task from an unlabeled target domain. However, multiple source domains often contain much redundant or unrelated information which can harm transfer performance, especially when in massive-source domain settings. It is urgent to develop effective strategies for identifying and selecting the most transferable knowledge from massive source domains to address the target task. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain adaptation method named \underline{\textit{Auto}}nomous Source Knowledge \underline{\textit{S}}election (AutoS) to autonomosly select source training samples and models, enabling the prediction of target task using more relevant and transferable source information. The proposed method employs a density-driven selection strategy to choose source samples during training and to determine which source models should contribute to target prediction. Simulteneously, a pseudo-label enhancement module built on a pre-trained multimodal modal is employed to mitigate target label noise and improve self-supervision. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method.

### [163] [SepsisSuite: Beyond Risk Stratification -- A Comparative Analysis of Deep Fusion vs. Expert Stacking for Prescriptive Sepsis AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14712)
*Ryan Cartularo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a comparison of advanced architectures for sepsis prediction and treatment, overcoming challenges in multi-modal fusion and offering a high-performing solution using Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve sepsis prediction and treatment by addressing the limitations of traditional models, which struggle with heterogeneous data integration and fail to deliver robust preventative care.

Method: An End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking approach were compared. A Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network was proposed, alongside a refined leaner architecture (SepsisLateFusion) using CatBoost meta-learning.

Result: SepsisLateFusion achieved SOTA performance with 0.915 AUC for prediction and reduced missed cases by 48%. Its multi-class antibiotic selection model showed strong results, achieving a 0.72 AUC.

Conclusion: SepsisLateFusion significantly improves prediction and prescribing capabilities, marking a step towards preventative care. The SepsisSuite framework offers practical implementation for clinical use.

Abstract: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, yet conventional prediction models often fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams, remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion. In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the "Historian" (Static), the "Monitor" (Temporal), and the "Reader" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

*Georges Sfeir,Stephane Hess,Thomas O. Hancock,Filipe Rodrigues,Jamal Amani Rad,Michiel Bliemer,Matthew Beck,Fayyaz Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model to understand individual travel decision-making and estimates it using a driving simulator dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to identify and model heterogeneity in travelers' preferences and their evolution over time, considering the role of learning and adaptation in travel decisions.

Method: The researchers propose a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model and utilize Variational Bayes to estimate its parameters using data from a driving simulator.

Result: The analysis identifies three traveler classes: context-dependent with exploitative tendencies, persistent exploitative, and exploratory with context-specific preferences.

Conclusion: The study highlights significant diversity in learning and adaptation strategies among travelers, offering insights into travel behavior modeling.

Abstract: Many travel decisions involve a degree of experience formation, where individuals learn their preferences over time. At the same time, there is extensive scope for heterogeneity across individual travellers, both in their underlying preferences and in how these evolve. The present paper puts forward a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that allows analysts to capture both of these phenomena. We apply the model to a driving simulator dataset and estimate the parameters through Variational Bayes. We identify three distinct classes of individuals that differ markedly in how they adapt their preferences: the first displays context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies; the second follows a persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context; and the third engages in an exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.

*Lucas Cesar Ferreira Domingos,Russell Brinkworth,Paulo Eduardo Santos,Karl Sammut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a novel deep learning model that excels in underwater acoustic target classification, overcoming challenges like noise and limited data availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by complex underwater noise and limited standardised datasets in acoustic target classification.

Method: A new architecture named GSE ResNeXt integrates learnable Gabor convolutional layers as adaptive filters and squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms to enhance classification accuracy and model robustness.

Result: GSE ResNeXt exhibited superior classification performance compared to baseline models, improved training stability, and converged in less time (28% reduction).

Conclusion: The proposed model highlights the importance of signal processing in underwater acoustic classification and calls for continued efforts to mitigate environmental factors influencing input signals.

Abstract: Remotely detecting and classifying underwater acoustic targets is critical for environmental monitoring and defence. However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios. Future developments should focus on mitigating the impact of environmental factors on input signals.

### [166] [A Regime-Aware Fusion Framework for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15378)
*Honey Singh Chauhan,Zahraa S. Abdallah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Revisits combining different representations for better univariate time series classification, introducing Fusion-3 (F3) to improve performance compared to Rocket on specific dataset types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Rocket's limitations and explore how combining complementary representations can provide better performance on univariate time series classification.

Method: Developed Fusion-3 (F3) framework fusing Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations, analyzed dataset characteristics by clustering them into interpretable regimes, and evaluated using paired statistics, ablation studies, SHAP attribution, with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: F3 consistently improved Rocket's performance on datasets with structured variability and frequency content, while less effective for irregular or outlier-heavy datasets. Case studies pinpointed fusion's corrections of specific errors.

Conclusion: Selective fusion of representations like Rocket, Sax, and Sfa enhances kernel-based methods like Rocket on time-series classification tasks, correcting weaknesses with dataset-specific adaptability.

Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.

### [167] [How a Bit Becomes a Story: Semantic Steering via Differentiable Fault Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14715)
*Zafaryab Haider,Md Hafizur Rahman,Shane Moeykens,Vijay Devabhaktuni,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how single bit flips in weights of a large language model used for image captioning can semantically alter the generated descriptions while keeping grammatical accuracy, introducing a differentiable framework, BLADE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the vulnerability of large language models in generative tasks to low-level hardware bit flips, and how such perturbations affect the semantic meaning and output fluency of the model.

Method: The method involves developing a differentiable fault analysis framework, called BLADE, which uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to identify critical bits and refines their selection by optimizing for semantic and fluency objectives.

Result: The study demonstrates that semantic shifts due to bit-level faults are predictable and reveals that imperceptible changes can significantly influence the high-level meanings produced by vision-language models.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into how semantic meaning is encoded and offer potential advancements in robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI by understanding the impact of structured bit-level faults.

Abstract: Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GPT-OSS models against other LLMs in financial tasks and finds that the smaller GPT-OSS-20B performs competitively with higher efficiency, challenging the idea that larger models are always better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) in financial services, focusing on their performance, efficiency, and deployment suitability.

Method: Conducted comprehensive testing of GPT-OSS (120B and 20B models) and various LLMs on ten financial NLP tasks using real-world datasets. Introduced new efficiency metrics to evaluate performance-resource trade-offs.

Result: GPT-OSS-20B demonstrated comparable accuracy to its larger variant but excelled in computational efficiency, challenging the assumption that larger models perform better. It outperformed larger competitors like Qwen3-235B.

Conclusion: Architectural improvements and training methods in GPT-OSS allow smaller models to achieve competitive results with reduced computational effort, making them viable for cost-effective deployment in financial contexts.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2]. Our findings demonstrate that architectural innovations and training strategies in GPT-OSS enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, offering a pathway toward sustainable and cost-effective deployment of LLMs in financial applications.

### [169] [Soft Geometric Inductive Bias for Object Centric Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15493)
*Hampus Linander,Conor Heins,Alexander Tschantz,Marco Perin,Christopher Buckley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces object-centric world models using geometric algebra neural networks for 2D rigid body dynamics to achieve better physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of exact group equivariance in learning physical dynamics and improve generalization via soft geometric priors.

Method: The authors use geometric algebra neural networks with a soft geometric inductive bias to model object dynamics in autoregressive next-step predictions.

Result: The proposed models outperform non-equivariant ones in long-horizon rollouts regarding physical fidelity and sample efficiency in multi-object scenes.

Conclusion: Geometric algebra provides an effective balance between structured physics models and unstructured neural networks for robust and efficient physical dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.

### [170] [SEED: Spectral Entropy-Guided Evaluation of SpatialTemporal Dependencies for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14718)
*Feng Xiong,Zongxia Xie,Yanru Sun,Haoyu Wang,Jianhong Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEED, a spectral entropy-guided framework, to enhance multivariate time series forecasting by addressing issues in current attention and graph-based methods. SEED demonstrates superior performance across 12 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multivariate time series forecasting struggle with disrupted temporal self-dependencies, overlooked negative correlations, and temporal position awareness of variables.

Method: The SEED framework includes key components: (1) Dependency Evaluator using spectral entropy for balancing independence and dependence strategies, (2) Spectral Entropy-based Fuser for refining dependency weights, (3) Signed Graph Constructor to preserve negative correlations, and (4) Context Spatial Extractor for better spatial feature modeling.

Result: SEED achieves state-of-the-art results on 12 diverse real-world datasets, confirming its effectiveness in improving forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: The SEED framework effectively addresses limitations in existing methods and demonstrates strong generality and performance in multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Effective multivariate time series forecasting often benefits from accurately modeling complex inter-variable dependencies. However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.

TL;DR: This paper establishes a connection between Autoregressive Models (ARMs) and Energy-Based Models (EBMs) using probability chain rules and maximum entropy reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified understanding of ARMs and EBMs and explore EBMs' utility in post-training alignment for large language models.

Method: The paper derives a bijection between ARMs and EBMs, linking it to soft Bellman equations in reinforcement learning and analyzes supervised learning equivalencies and distillation error bounds.

Result: Identified theoretical connections and differences between ARMs and EBMs, providing insights into ARMs' planning abilities despite their token prediction approach.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the understanding of ARM planning capabilities and their alignment with reinforcement learning principles, offering potential for future LLM developments.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework, Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), to improve the interpretability and robustness of small language models by guiding them to capture finer class distinctions using enhanced attribution priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of deriving general and reliable attribution priors for small language models, especially in settings where similar classes are difficult to distinguish, and existing attribution methods fail to provide sufficient discriminative information.

Method: The paper proposes the CAP framework to extract fine-grained class distinctions and produce salient attribution priors. Additionally, the CAP Hybrid approach combines CAP with existing attribution techniques to provide a balanced supervisory signal, aligning the model's self-attributions with improved priors.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method enhances the interpretability and robustness of small language models across full-data, few-shot, and adversarial settings.

Conclusion: The CAP framework improves the differentiation abilities of small language models by enabling them to learn more diverse and decision-relevant features, significantly advancing model interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to automatically generate Synthea rules for creating synthetic medical data based on real-world statistics, focusing on glioblastoma as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate the secondary use of realistic medical data in a privacy-compliant way, while addressing the complexity and expertise required to generate meaningful rules for synthetic patient data generation.

Method: The researchers developed an automated approach to create Synthea rules by extracting statistics from tabular cancer report data and applied this to create synthetic glioblastoma patient data.

Result: The synthetic data successfully reproduced known disease patterns and preserved statistical properties when compared to real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data provides a powerful tool for privacy-preserving medical research; however, limitations must be acknowledged when interpreting medical results derived from such datasets.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is a promising technology to make medical data available for secondary use in a privacy-compliant manner. A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties. Overall, synthetic patient data holds great potential for privacy-preserving research. The data can be used to formulate hypotheses and to develop prototypes, but medical interpretation should consider the specific limitations as with any currently available approach.

Motivation: To address the limitations in scalability and efficiency of traditional Groebner bases computation as initially introduced by Kera et al. using transformers.

Method: Introduces Hierarchical Attention Transformers (HATs) which leverage a tree-structured inductive bias and curriculum learning, providing better modeling and computational savings for systems of polynomial equations.

Result: Achieved computational efficiency and scalability, solving larger instances than previously achieved by Kera et al. 2024.

Abstract: At NeurIPS 2024, Kera et al. introduced the use of transformers for computing Groebner bases, a central object in computer algebra with numerous practical applications. In this paper, we improve this approach by applying Hierarchical Attention Transformers (HATs) to solve systems of multivariate polynomial equations via Groebner bases computation. The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models. We generalize to arbitrary depths and include a detailed computational cost analysis. Combined with curriculum learning, our method solves instances that are much larger than those in Kera et al.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative diffusion framework for modeling urban wind fields efficiently over complex urban geometries, using only geometry data and providing accurate, diverse velocity field predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for efficient urban wind modeling to assess air quality and facilitate sustainable city planning, while overcoming the challenges posed by computationally expensive CFD simulations and geometric complexities.

Method: The framework utilizes a hierarchical graph neural network combined with diffusion modeling to synthesize steady-state wind fields over unstructured meshes. It is trained across various wind conditions and geometries, allowing generalization and uncertainty-aware predictions.

Result: The model successfully generalizes to new geometries, accurately captures key flow structures like wakes and recirculations, and demonstrates robustness against mesh variations. Ablation studies underline its effectiveness under differing conditions.

Conclusion: This research establishes a foundational model for rapid urban environmental analysis, enabling planners to evaluate design decisions efficiently amidst urban densification and climate uncertainties.

Abstract: Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), which uses quantum-inspired mechanisms to enhance performance in offline reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline reinforcement learning often struggles with long horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies, which current Decision Transformer (DT) architectures fail to effectively address.

Method: The QDT architecture integrates Quantum-Inspired Attention for non-local feature correlations and Quantum Feedforward Networks for adaptive computation via learnable interference.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show over 2,000% performance improvement over standard DTs, with superior generalization across diverse data qualities.

Conclusion: Holistic co-design of quantum-inspired mechanisms leads to dramatic improvements. QDT can significantly advance transformer architectures, with broad implications beyond reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.

*Klaus-Rudolf Kladny,Bernhard Schölkopf,Lisa Koch,Christian F. Baumgartner,Michael Muehlebach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the application of Conformal Prediction (CP) in healthcare, emphasizing issues with its reliance on calibration set sizes for practical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses concerns about the reliability of uncertainty estimates in machine learning for healthcare, where obtaining large calibration datasets is often infeasible.

Method: The authors analyze the theoretical guarantees of CP and conduct an empirical experiment in a medical image classification task.

Result: They find that, though CP provides statistical guarantees with small calibration sets, the practical utility of these guarantees diminishes as calibration set sizes reduce.

Conclusion: The utility of CP in medical applications is challenged, especially in data-scarce domains, despite its theoretical promises.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming healthcare, but safe clinical decisions demand reliable uncertainty estimates that standard ML models fail to provide. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible. We corroborate our critique in an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task.

*Jie He,Yong Qin,Jianyuan Guo,Xuan Sun,Xuanchuan Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a data-driven approach for inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail systems using AFC and AVL data, achieving >90% accuracy during peak hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance operation organization and improve trajectory inference accuracy in urban rail transit systems without relying on external survey data.

Method: A fully data-driven approach using spatio-temporal constraints and the KLEM method (KL divergence with EM algorithm) for adaptive parameter estimation, validated with real-world data.

Result: The proposed method achieves over 90% accuracy in passenger trajectory inference in peak hours, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves trajectory inference accuracy, eliminates reliance on external data, and provides a robust model applicable to real-world urban rail scenarios.

Abstract: Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.

### [179] [Semantic Geometry for policy-constrained interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14731)
*Nikit Phadke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric framework for semantic interpretation that prevents hallucinations in crucial scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinated commitments in sensitive contexts where accurate policy adherence is essential.

Method: Semantic representation using spherical geometry, policy constraints modeled as priors on the sphere, and inference reduced to constrained optimization.

Result: Achieved zero hallucinations in evaluations on large-scale regulated financial data across different policies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates policy constraints and geometric semantics to eliminate errors in critical domains.

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for policy-constrained semantic interpretation that provably prevents hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains. Semantic meaning is represented as direction on a unit sphere, evidence is modeled as sets of witness vectors, and admissible interpretations correspond to spherical convex regions. Policy constraints are introduced as explicit priors defined over the same manifold, separated from evidence geometry. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions, with refusal emerging as a topologically necessary outcome under contradiction or policy exclusion. We connect this framework to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, proving that our complexity bounds are information-theoretically optimal. Empirical validation on large scale regulated financial data demonstrates zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes-the first such result at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI framework using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for detecting and reporting incidental findings in abdominal CT scans more efficiently and accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the time-consuming and variable nature of manual radiologist inspection for incidental findings in CT scans.

Method: A plan-and-execute framework where LLMs generate Python scripts for detection and classification, executed by models like VLMs, segmentation systems, and image processors.

Result: Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show the proposed framework is superior to VLM-only methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach automates guideline-based detection and improves clinical reporting for incidental findings in abdominal CT scans.

Abstract: Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

*Qiang Chen,Venkatesh Ganapati Hegde,Hongfei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight method for intra-day personalization in long-form video streaming. It updates stale user features with recent watch history at inference time, boosting user engagement without retraining the recommendation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the limitations of existing batch-trained recommender systems which provide stale recommendations due to infrequent user feature updates.

Method: The method involves selectively overriding outdated user features at inference time using recent user watch history. This approach is model-agnostic and does not require retraining.

Result: The implementation led to a 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics, showing a significant improvement over traditional daily-updated systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that intra-day personalization is impactful for video streaming, offering a viable and efficient alternative to real-time systems requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Many recommender systems in long-form video streaming reply on batch-trained models and batch-updated features, where user features are updated daily and served statically throughout the day. While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming service, providing a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures where model retraining is required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of identifying novel AI papers amidst a surge in publications, presenting a model for scalable novelty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in identifying innovative works due to growing publication volumes and inefficiency of manual novelty assessment necessitates a scalable, data-driven solution.

Method: The authors propose two approaches: binary classification for absolute novelty prediction and pairwise comparison for relative novelty ranking, leveraging fine-tuned models SciBERT and Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507.

Result: The research benchmarks model performance against GPT-5.1 and provides insights into the impact of task formulations and modeling strategies on novelty estimation.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework to evaluate and rank the conceptual novelty of AI papers, aiding researchers and reviewers in identifying impactful work efficiently.

Abstract: With the growing ease of academic publishing, the volume of research papers, especially in AI-related fields, has surged dramatically. This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank.

### [184] [Evaluating Weather Forecasts from a Decision Maker's Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14779)
*Kornelius Raeth,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates weather forecasts by their impact on decision-making, not just statistical accuracy, introducing a novel framework called decision calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional weather forecast evaluations emphasize statistical accuracy, overlooking the practical impact of forecasts on real-world decision-making.

Method: The paper introduces decision calibration to assess forecast models based on decision-level performance, comparing Machine Learning and classical models through various weather-dependent tasks.

Result: The study reveals that strong forecast performance doesn't always translate to better decision-making. Rankings of forecast models vary based on specific decision tasks.

Conclusion: Traditional evaluation methods do not suffice. Decision calibration should be adopted for better model selection tailored to specific decision tasks.

Abstract: Standard weather forecast evaluations focus on the forecaster's perspective and on a statistical assessment comparing forecasts and observations. In practice, however, forecasts are used to make decisions, so it seems natural to take the decision-maker's perspective and quantify the value of a forecast by its ability to improve decision-making. Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks. Our results confirm that typical forecast evaluations are insufficient for selecting the optimal forecast model for a specific decision task.

*Aslak Djupskås,Alexander Johannes Stasik,Signe Riemer-Sørensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) for uncertainty estimation in deep learning, finding it struggles to reflect true uncertainty compared to Bayesian approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the reliability of uncertainty estimates in machine learning, focusing on Monte Carlo dropout due to its computational efficiency in approximating Bayesian inference.

Method: The study empirically compares Monte Carlo dropout to Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Neural Networks regarding their capacity to estimate uncertainties.

Result: MCD is found to inadequately reflect true uncertainty, especially failing in regions requiring extrapolation and interpolation, compared to Bayesian approaches.

Conclusion: MCD is less reliable than Bayesian models for uncertainty estimation in capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models, especially in safety-critical domains. While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep learning by applying neuron dropout at inference time \citep{gal2016dropout}. Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty. We empirically investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models. The findings suggest that uncertainty estimates from MCD, as implemented and evaluated in these experiments, is not as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian approaches for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

### [186] [How Does Fourier Analysis Network Work? A Mechanism Analysis and a New Dual-Activation Layer Proposal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14873)
*Sam Jeong,Hae Yong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes why Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) improves neural networks, discovering that sine activations, not cosine, contribute to faster convergence by mitigating the vanishing-gradient and dying-ReLU problems, culminating in the development of Dual-Activation Layer (DAL). DAL accelerates convergence and outperforms conventional activations in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the mechanism behind the performance improvements of Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) and leverage this understanding to design more efficient neural network activations.

Method: The authors analyze the roles of sine and cosine activations in FAN, focusing on dynamics like the vanishing-gradient and dying-ReLU problems, and develop the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL) as a modified activation approach. They evaluate DAL across multiple tasks.

Result: They find sine activations mitigate vanishing-gradient and dying-ReLU issues, propose DAL for faster convergence, and show in experiments across three tasks that DAL models achieve faster convergence and higher or comparable validation accuracy than those using conventional activations.

Conclusion: Replacing cosine with more beneficial sine activations improves training dynamics in FAN. DAL further advances beyond FAN by accelerating convergence and achieving better performance, shedding light on the practical utility of tailored activation functions for deep learning.

Abstract: Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.

*Jingwei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP) to address model collapse in self-referential learning, unifying existing fixes under one framework that controls entropy flow for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of model collapse in self-referential learning and provide a unified explanation for both the failure modes and the success of stabilisation strategies.

Method: Proposes Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-theoretic framework that utilizes entropy reservoirs to stabilize the dynamics of learning systems by injecting controllable entropy flux.

Result: ERBP offers a theoretical foundation that predicts stabilization of learning systems, with experiments showing successful validation across language models, reinforcement learning, and GANs.

Conclusion: ERBP unifies disparate stabilization techniques and provides a quantitative design principle to monitor and control entropy flux, effectively mitigating model collapse.

Abstract: Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces task matrices to show implicit linear encodings in model adaptation, achieving performance near fine-tuned levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the existence of linear representations during model adaptation beyond in-context prompting and validate their efficiency.

Method: The authors propose the concept of a task matrix that maps base model embeddings to fine-tuned states, evaluating its performance on vision and text models across datasets.

Result: Task matrices outperformed linear probes and approached fine-tuning levels; the authors validated cross-layer linear encodings and showed generalizable and efficient task matrix design.

Conclusion: Linear encodings exist across pretrained and fine-tuned models, task matrices achieve strong adaptation performance, and the approach is effective and versatile across domains.

Abstract: Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OLR-WA is a novel online regression model achieving rapid convergence, high performance, and versatility in various scenarios, including time and confidence-based drifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in online learning by creating a novel model that can handle evolving data patterns, achieve rapid convergence, and effectively process diverse scenarios, including temporal and confidence-based drifts.

Method: OLR-WA is introduced as a multivariate online regression model using a weighted average approach that prioritizes older, confident data points. Convergence analysis and comparisons with state-of-the-art models are conducted.

Result: OLR-WA achieves comparable or superior performance to batch regression and other online models. It demonstrates rapid convergence with minimal initial data and excels in managing time and confidence-based evolving data.

Conclusion: OLR-WA proves to be a versatile and effective solution for online linear regression, offering strong performance, adaptability to different scenarios, and rapid convergence.

Abstract: Online learning updates models incrementally with new data, avoiding large storage requirements and costly model recalculations. In this paper, we introduce "OLR-WA; OnLine Regression with Weighted Average", a novel and versatile multivariate online linear regression model. We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels. In summary, OLR-WA's performance further solidifies its versatility and utility across different contexts, making it a valuable solution for online linear regression tasks.

*Niklas Lauffer,Xiang Deng,Srivatsa Kundurthy,Brad Kenstler,Jeff Da*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies the issue of covariate shift in imitation learning for multi-turn language model (LM) agents and proposes a new methodology using on-policy expert corrections (OECs) to address it. Experiments in software engineering tasks show substantial improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitation of covariate shift in imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents, which occurs as the student's policy diverges from the expert's policy, leading to less effective training.

Method: The paper introduces On-Policy Expert Corrections (OEC), a novel data generation strategy. This involves partially on-policy data by starting rollouts with a student model and switching to an expert model midway. It combines this methodology with rejection sampling and supervised fine-tuning for training.

Result: Experiments in the software engineering domain demonstrate that using OEC data yields a relative improvement of 14% (7b models) and 13% (32b models) over traditional imitation learning approaches.

Conclusion: The study concludes that combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data is crucial for effective training of multi-turn LM agents, particularly in complex domains like software engineering.

Abstract: A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.

TL;DR: Presented ATLAS, a scalable graph learning algorithm addressing limitations of GNNs in heterophilic graphs and scalability issues using MLPs enhanced with multi-resolution community features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in graph neural networks, particularly performance degradation on heterophilic graphs and scalability constraints on large graphs.

Method: Extract multi-resolution topological community features and combine them with feature vectors, leveraging MLPs instead of traditional iterative aggregation used in GNNs.

Result: ATLAS achieves up to 20% higher accuracy on heterophilic graphs compared to GCN and improves performance on homophilic graphs by up to 11%.

Conclusion: ATLAS effectively improves accuracy for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs while enabling scalability and paving the way for explainable graph learning approaches.

Abstract: We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.

TL;DR: The paper presents FrontierCS, a challenging benchmark of 156 open-ended computer science problems aimed at testing models on tasks with unknown optimal solutions, evaluated through executable programs rather than direct answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on tasks with known solutions, lacking a rigorous testbed for evaluating models on open-ended problems with measurable progress.

Method: FrontierCS consists of problems designed by experts, spanning algorithmic and research challenges, with objective evaluation frameworks and expert reference solutions. Models are tasked to implement executable programs to solve these problems.

Result: Current frontier reasoning models perform significantly worse than human experts, even with extended reasoning budgets, and tend to focus on generating functional code rather than innovative algorithms or system designs.

Conclusion: FrontierCS provides a novel and rigorous benchmark for advancing the state of the art in tackling open-ended, complex computer science problems.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierCS, a benchmark of 156 open-ended problems across diverse areas of computer science, designed and reviewed by experts, including CS PhDs and top-tier competitive programming participants and problem setters. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on tasks with known optimal solutions, FrontierCS targets problems where the optimal solution is unknown, but the quality of a solution can be objectively evaluated. Models solve these tasks by implementing executable programs rather than outputting a direct answer. FrontierCS includes algorithmic problems, which are often NP-hard variants of competitive programming problems with objective partial scoring, and research problems with the same property. For each problem we provide an expert reference solution and an automatic evaluator. Combining open-ended design, measurable progress, and expert curation, FrontierCS provides a benchmark at the frontier of computer-science difficulty. Empirically, we find that frontier reasoning models still lag far behind human experts on both the algorithmic and research tracks, that increasing reasoning budgets alone does not close this gap, and that models often over-optimize for generating merely workable code instead of discovering high-quality algorithms and system designs.

*Felipe J. P. Antunes,Yuri F. Saporito,Sebastian Jaimungal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel method combining Picard iterations, elicitability, and deep learning to efficiently solve McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) under common noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient computational methods to solve MV-FBSDEs in the presence of common noise without relying on expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations.

Method: The method utilizes elicitability-based path-loss functions for neural network training, recurrent neural networks for mean-field interaction, and feedforward networks for approximating backward processes.

Result: The algorithm accurately recovers analytical solutions in a systemic risk inter-bank model and demonstrates versatility in handling quantile-mediated interaction and complex economic growth models.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness and flexibility of combining elicitability and deep learning for solving MV-FBSDEs and complex mean-field games.

Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with common noise, combining Picard iterations, elicitability and deep learning. The key innovation involves elicitability to derive a path-wise loss function, enabling efficient training of neural networks to approximate both the backward process and the conditional expectations arising from common noise - without requiring computationally expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations. The mean-field interaction term is parameterized via a recurrent neural network trained to minimize an elicitable score, while the backward process is approximated through a feedforward network representing the decoupling field. We validate the algorithm on a systemic risk inter-bank borrowing and lending model, where analytical solutions exist, demonstrating accurate recovery of the true solution. We further extend the model to quantile-mediated interactions, showcasing the flexibility of the elicitability framework beyond conditional means or moments. Finally, we apply the method to a non-stationary Aiyagari--Bewley--Huggett economic growth model with endogenous interest rates, illustrating its applicability to complex mean-field games without closed-form solutions.

*Victor M. Yeom Song,Severi Rissanen,Arno Solin,Samuel Kaski,Mingfei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models often fail to meet constraints in scientific applications. This paper proposes modifying the denoiser to softly enforce constraints without altering loss or sampling, improving its compliance and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require meeting constraints in scientific applications; existing solutions often bias models away from true distributions, especially when constraints are misspecified.

Method: The paper integrates a guidance-inspired adjustment directly into the denoiser, creating a soft inductive bias toward constraint-compliance without altering the loss or sampling methods.

Result: Softly constrained denoisers demonstrate improved compliance with constraints and maintain the ability to adapt to misspecified constraints in observed data.

Conclusion: By modifying the denoiser, the proposed method achieves better constraint compliance and flexibility, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces and polynomially growing rewards, focusing on finance and economics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in learning and control for continuous, high-dimensional, and unbounded domains, which are common in finance, economics, and operations research.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm that adaptively partitions the state-action space, maintaining estimators for drift, volatility, and rewards to balance exploration and approximation effectively.

Result: The authors derive regret bounds tailored to unbounded diffusion processes, which extend existing results to broader settings, and validate the algorithm's effectiveness through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The algorithm provides a robust and efficient solution for reinforcement learning in unbounded domains, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance in high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.

TL;DR: DreamPRM-Code is a new Process Reward Model aimed at improving coding in LLMs through modular code generation and noise correction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle with coding tasks due to lack of meaningful step decompositions and noisy Monte-Carlo labels.

Method: Introduces the Chain-of-Function prompting strategy for modular code generation and a meta-learning-based correction mechanism for refining noisy labels.

Result: Achieved 80.9 pass@1 rate on LiveCodeBench, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

Conclusion: DreamPRM-Code effectively improves step decomposition and label noise issues in coding, setting a new benchmark for coding-related PRMs.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

*Sandeep Neela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic tool to extract and explain structural price patterns in financial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for transparent and reproducible methods to analyze price behaviors in financial markets, focusing on overcoming the limitations of predictive models and technical indicators in providing clear explanations.

Method: SPA uses daily OHLCV data and normalized event streams to identify monotonic price runs and correlate them with public events, providing factual, historical, and auditable explanations.

Result: Testing on four equities (AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, PGR) shows that SPA consistently provides stable structural decompositions and meaningful narratives, verified through ablation experiments showcasing its contribution to interpretability.

Conclusion: SPA adds value by offering an auditable and explainable framework for historical price structure analysis, complementing analyst workflows and AI pipelines without functioning as a predictive or trading system.

Abstract: Understanding how prices evolve over time often requires peeling back the layers of market noise to identify clear, structural behavior. Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.

### [200] [Epistemic diversity across language models mitigates knowledge collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15011)
*Damian Hodel,Jevin D. West*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies how diversity among AI models affects knowledge collapse and finds that optimal diversity can help mitigate the collapse, but excessive or insufficient diversity also causes issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address concerns about knowledge collapse in AI systems, particularly investigating how diversity among AI models might alleviate such collapse.

Method: The authors simulated ecosystems of AI models trained on their collective output and analyzed performance across ten training iterations, examining the effects of varying diversity levels among models.

Result: They found that epistemic diversity mitigates knowledge collapse to an optimal degree; however, too little or too much diversity leads to performance decay.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of maintaining balanced diversity among AI systems and emphasize the need for policies promoting variation in AI models to prevent knowledge collapse.

Abstract: The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.

### [201] [Spectral Representation-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15036)
*Chenxiao Gao,Haotian Sun,Na Li,Dale Schuurmans,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral representations improve Reinforcement Learning (RL) by addressing issues in optimization, exploration, and computational costs, achieving competitive results in challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL methods face challenges with theoretical ambiguities, optimization instability, and computational costs due to reliance on complex function approximations, like neural networks.

Method: Utilizes spectral representations based on transition operators, providing effective abstraction for system dynamics, clear theoretical insights, and new learning methods for extracting spectral features.

Result: Achieved comparable or better performance with spectral-based RL algorithms in challenging tasks, validated on the DeepMind Control Suite.

Conclusion: Spectral representations offer promising solutions for RL, enabling improvements in stability, exploration, and theoretical robustness in diverse applications.

Abstract: In real-world applications with large state and action spaces, reinforcement learning (RL) typically employs function approximations to represent core components like the policies, value functions, and dynamics models. Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs. Finally, we validate these algorithms on over 20 challenging tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where they achieve performances comparable or superior to current state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines.

*Zijiang Yan,Yixiang Huang,Jianhua Pei,Hina Tabassum,Luca Chiaraviglio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents EMFusion, a forecasting framework for predicting electromagnetic field (EMF) levels with improved accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gaps in univariate wideband EMF forecasting by proposing a multivariate frequency-selective approach. This is crucial for proactive network planning, compliance, and health impact assessments.

Method: The paper introduces EMFusion, which uses a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework. It employs a residual U-Net backbone, cross-attention mechanisms, and treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task using an imputation-based sampling strategy.

Result: Numerical experiments show that EMFusion significantly outperforms baseline models in forecasting accuracy, reducing CRPS by 23.85%, normalized RMSE by 13.93%, and prediction CRPS error by 22.47%.

Conclusion: The results highlight EMFusion as a superior forecasting model with robust uncertainty estimation, positioning it as a valuable tool for trustworthy decision-making and efficient network planning in EMF management.

Abstract: The rapid growth in wireless infrastructure has increased the need to accurately estimate and forecast electromagnetic field (EMF) levels to ensure ongoing compliance, assess potential health impacts, and support efficient network planning. While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%.

*Debu Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines limitations of embedding-based hallucination detection methods in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, demonstrating high false positive rates and proposing alternative reasoning-based detection approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unveil the weaknesses of current hallucination detection methods in RAG systems, and offer rigorous evaluations to better detect hallucinations through reasoning rather than semantic embeddings.

Method: The study applies conformal prediction to hallucination detection, testing embedding-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and others across synthetic and real benchmarks.

Result: Embedding-based methods struggle with false positive rates on real hallucination benchmarks, but GPT-4 as a reasoning-based determinant achieves a significantly lower false positive rate.

Conclusion: Embedding-based detection methods are unsuitable for practical RAG systems, and reasoning-based approaches offer a more viable solution for addressing hallucinations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.

TL;DR: FEAML is a novel automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification leveraging LLMs, metadata, and feedback mechanisms to continuously optimize features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are not adapted to multi-label tasks and lack modeling complex label dependencies.

Method: FEAML uses LLMs guided by metadata and label co-occurrence matrices to generate features, evaluates them via model accuracy and Pearson correlation, and iteratively optimizes through feedback.

Result: FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods across various multi-label datasets.

Conclusion: FEAML provides an efficient, interpretable, and self-improving feature engineering approach for multi-label classification.

Abstract: Existing feature engineering methods based on large language models (LLMs) have not yet been applied to multi-label learning tasks. They lack the ability to model complex label dependencies and are not specifically adapted to the characteristics of multi-label tasks. To address the above issues, we propose Feature Engineering Automation for Multi-Label Learning (FEAML), an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs. By utilizing metadata and label co-occurrence matrices, LLMs are guided to understand the relationships between data features and task objectives, based on which high-quality features are generated. The newly generated features are evaluated in terms of model accuracy to assess their effectiveness, while Pearson correlation coefficients are used to detect redundancy. FEAML further incorporates the evaluation results as feedback to drive LLMs to continuously optimize code generation in subsequent iterations. By integrating LLMs with a feedback mechanism, FEAML realizes an efficient, interpretable and self-improving feature engineering paradigm. Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that our FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Modular Physics (NMP), a simulation approach that integrates neural networks with classical simulation principles, achieving greater physical consistency, stability, and generalizability than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional end-to-end neural network-based simulation methods, which lack physical interpretability and reliability found in classical numerical simulators.

Method: The method involves decomposing elastic dynamics into meaningful neural modules connected by intermediate physical quantities. The proposed architecture and training strategy transform the simulation process into a modular neural system, enabling intermediate supervision and adherence to physical constraints.

Result: NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, long-horizon stability, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and handles scenarios with unknown dynamics better than traditional simulators.

Conclusion: By combining neural networks with the modular approach of classical simulators, NMP offers a robust solution that balances learning-based adaptability with physical reliability, making it a valuable tool for elastic simulations.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the instability in operator learning frameworks and improve their predictive accuracy and robustness, inspired by classical partition-of-unity methods.

Method: Developed PIP$^{2}$ Net utilizing physics-informed regularization and a revised partition penalty to enhance operator stability and locality.

Result: PIP$^{2}$ Net demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness in predicting spatiotemporal fields of nonlinear PDEs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PIP$^{2}$ Net advances operator learning by improving model stability and prediction for nonlinear PDEs, proving a practical enhancement over prior architectures.

Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool for accelerating the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling rapid prediction of full spatiotemporal fields for new initial conditions or forcing functions. Existing architectures such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) show strong empirical performance but often require large training datasets, lack explicit physical structure, and may suffer from instability in their trunk-network features, where mode imbalance or collapse can hinder accurate operator approximation. Motivated by the stability and locality of classical partition-of-unity (PoU) methods, we investigate PoU-based regularization techniques for operator learning and develop a revised formulation of the existing POU--PI--DeepONet framework. The resulting \emph{P}hysics-\emph{i}nformed \emph{P}artition \emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents SigMA, a novel neural architecture combining path signatures and attention mechanisms to improve parameter inference in systems driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional parameter estimation methods for non-Markovian, non-semimartingale systems modeled by fractional Brownian motion (fBm).

Method: The proposed method, SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, a convolutional preprocessing layer, and a multilayer perceptron for improved feature encoding.

Result: SigMA outperformed standard models like CNN, LSTM, Transformer, and Deep Signature in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating signature transforms with attention-based architectures offers a scalable and effective approach for parameter inference in stochastic systems with complex temporal structures.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.

*Sunwoo Kim,Soo Yong Lee,Kyungho Kim,Hyunjin Hwang,Jaemin Yoo,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FUEL is introduced as a method for adaptive node representation learning that addresses limitations in unsupervised graph convolution, performing strongly on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised node representation learning traditionally relies heavily on graph convolution, which can oversmooth and fail in non-homophilic graphs. This paper aims to reduce this problem by adaptively adjusting the role of graph convolution for better embeddings.

Method: The proposed FUEL method adapts the degree of graph convolution adaptively. It enhances intra-class similarity and inter-class separability by utilizing node clusters as proxies for classes in graphs without labels.

Result: FUEL demonstrated better performance in unsupervised tasks compared to 15 baseline methods across 14 benchmark datasets with various levels of homophily.

Conclusion: FUEL successfully addresses oversmoothing by allowing a flexible graph convolutional degree and achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised node representation learning results.

Abstract: Unsupervised node representation learning aims to obtain meaningful node embeddings without relying on node labels. To achieve this, graph convolution, which aggregates information from neighboring nodes, is commonly employed to encode node features and graph topology. However, excessive reliance on graph convolution can be suboptimal-especially in non-homophilic graphs-since it may yield unduly similar embeddings for nodes that differ in their features or topological properties. As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes. Through extensive experiments using 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FUEL in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for sequence modeling, highlights trade-offs between expressivity and trainability, and derives theoretical results connecting attention mechanisms and structured dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of the trade-offs between expressivity and trainability in sequence modeling architectures.

Method: Developing a unified framework for sequence maps using effective interaction operators and deriving theoretical results involving attention mechanisms and structured dynamical systems.

Result: Three key results: a rank gap between attention and dynamical models, an equivalence theorem linking heads to SSM dimensions, and a gradient propagation finding distinguishing attention and stable dynamics.

Conclusion: The study formalizes a trade-off between expressivity and gradient propagation in sequence architectures, offering insights for design optimizations.

Abstract: Sequence modeling has produced diverse architectures -- from classical recurrent neural networks to modern Transformers and state space models (SSMs) -- yet a unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs remains limited. We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FADTI, a novel frequency-informed diffusion-based framework for multivariate time series imputation, achieving superior performance under high missing rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor failures and irregular sampling in healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling lead to pervasive missing values, necessitating effective imputation mechanisms.

Method: FADTI combines frequency-informed feature modulation using a learnable Fourier Bias Projection module with self-attention and gated convolution for temporal modeling.

Result: FADTI outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, especially under high missing rates.

Conclusion: Injecting frequency-domain biases into the imputation process enhances model performance, ensuring better generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts, as demonstrated by FADTI's efficacy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental in applications such as healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling, where sensor failures and irregular sampling lead to pervasive missing values. However, existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts. We propose FADTI, a diffusion-based framework that injects frequency-informed feature modulation via a learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module and combines it with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, show that FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

*Yuqing Xie,Jiayu Chen,Wenhao Tang,Ya Zhang,Chao Yu,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MORSE is a framework for optimizing reward functions in reinforcement learning by combining multiple heuristic rewards through a bi-level optimization process, promoting effective task performance and exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of designing effective reward functions in multi-objective reinforcement learning environments to enhance task performance.

Method: MORSE uses a bi-level optimization technique where the inner loop trains a policy with shaped rewards and the outer loop updates the reward functions, incorporating stochastic noise to enhance exploration and avoid local minima.

Result: Experiments in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments demonstrate MORSE's ability to effectively balance multiple objectives and achieve performance similar to manually tuned reward functions.

Conclusion: MORSE shows potential as a reliable framework for automatically generating reward functions that balance objectives and perform effectively across robotic tasks.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in multi-objective environments. In this work, we propose Multi-Objective Reward Shaping with Exploration (MORSE), a general framework that automatically combines multiple human-designed heuristic rewards into a unified reward function. MORSE formulates the shaping process as a bi-level optimization problem: the inner loop trains a policy to maximize the current shaped reward, while the outer loop updates the reward function to optimize task performance. To encourage exploration in the reward space and avoid suboptimal local minima, MORSE introduces stochasticity into the shaping process, injecting noise guided by task performance and the prediction error of a fixed, randomly initialized neural network. Experimental results in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments show that MORSE effectively balances multiple objectives across various robotic tasks, achieving task performance comparable to those obtained with manually tuned reward functions.

TL;DR: TrajSyn is a privacy-focused framework enabling effective server-side adversarial training in Federated Learning (FL) by synthesizing proxy datasets from client model update trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adversarial vulnerability in Federated Learning (FL), particularly under privacy constraints and edge device limitations.

Method: The proposed method, TrajSyn, synthesizes a proxy dataset using client model update trajectories, enabling server-side adversarial training while preserving client data privacy.

Result: TrajSyn successfully enhances adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks without imposing additional compute requirements on client devices.

Conclusion: TrajSyn offers a practical and privacy-preserving solution for improving the adversarial defense of deep learning models in FL settings while respecting client-device constraints.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed on edge devices are increasingly used in safety-critical applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.

### [213] [From Isolation to Entanglement: When Do Interpretability Methods Identify and Disentangle Known Concepts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15134)
*Aaron Mueller,Andrew Lee,Shruti Joshi,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Dhanya Sridhar,Patrik Reizinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper questions the effectiveness of common featurization methods in disentangling causally relevant concepts, proposing a multi-concept evaluation setting to test the representation of these concepts under increasing correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address whether neural network featurization methods like sparse autoencoders and sparse probes truly recover disentangled and independent concept representations in interpretability.

Method: The authors introduce an evaluation framework that controls correlations between textual concepts and analyze how featurizers perform with increasing correlation strength. They also conduct steering experiments to assess concept manipulability.

Result: Results indicate that features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across multiple features. Featurizers struggle to disentangle multiple correlated concepts, and effective steering is difficult as features generally affect many concepts.

Conclusion: Current metrics and methods for assessing disentanglement and independence are insufficient. The findings emphasize the need for compositional evaluations in evaluating interpretability in machine learning models.

Abstract: A central goal of interpretability is to recover representations of causally relevant concepts from the activations of neural networks. The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies ML models' generalization and interpretability in crop yield predictions within Germany, revealing their weak temporal validation and exposing reliability issues with interpretability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the generalization and reliability of machine learning models in predicting crop yields, especially in temporal contexts, and to question the trustworthiness of post hoc interpretability methods in environmental and agricultural systems.

Method: The study systematically compares ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN) across spatial and temporal validation sets, using SHAP for feature importance evaluation.

Result: All models showed good performance on spatially split datasets but struggled with temporally independent validation years. SHAP feature importance appeared credible, despite poor model generalization, exposing issues in model interpretability.

Conclusion: Validation-aware model interpretation and domain-specific evaluations are crucial in ML applications for agriculture and environmental data to mitigate risks in generalization and interpretability reliability.

Abstract: This study examines the generalization performance and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used for predicting crop yield and yield anomalies in Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).
  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.
  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture. Ultimately, this work addresses a growing challenge in environmental data science: how can we evaluate generalization robustly enough to trust model explanations?

*Pablo Montaña-Fernández,Ines Ortega-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning, emphasizing vulnerabilities in multi-round federated scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in federated learning where model updates may leak sensitive information.

Method: Proposes a gradient-based membership inference attack leveraging temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Uses shadow techniques without accessing private datasets and includes both semi-honest and malicious adversaries.

Result: Demonstrates strong attack performance on various datasets (CIFAR-100, Purchase100, Breast Cancer Wisconsin), highlighting aggregators as more significant threats and showing increased vulnerability with richer datasets.

Conclusion: Federated learning is highly vulnerable to inference attacks, particularly in multi-round scenarios, with aggregators being primary threats and dataset nature greatly influencing leakage severity.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.

### [216] [Understanding NTK Variance in Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15169)
*Chengguang Ou,Yixin Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines how specific architectural choices in Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) impact Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) conditioning and proposes a unified framework to understand INR mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the slow convergence and inability to capture high-frequency details in INRs, linked to spectral bias and NTK eigenvalue conditioning.

Method: The authors analyze INR mechanisms through NTK eigenvalue variance factors and scaling terms, derive variance decompositions for common components, and experimentally validate their theoretical insights.

Result: Key INR components like positional encoding, spherical normalization, and Hadamard modulation improve NTK conditioning, enhancing model convergence speed and reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified understanding of how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias, leading to practical improvements in neural representation tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) often converge slowly and struggle to recover high-frequency details due to spectral bias. While prior work links this behavior to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning remains unclear. We show that many INR mechanisms can be understood through their impact on a small set of pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that jointly determine NTK eigenvalue variance. For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks confirm the predicted variance reductions and demonstrate faster, more stable convergence with improved reconstruction quality.

*Zicong Cheng,Guo-Wei Yang,Jia Li,Zhijie Deng,Meng-Hao Guo,Shi-Min Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of autoregressive (AR) decoding in LLM systems by introducing DEER, a framework that uses diffusion models for speculative decoding, achieving significantly improved speedup and draft acceptance lengths compared to existing methods like EAGLE-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of autoregressive (AR) decoding in terms of latency, inefficiency, and trust issues within speculative decoding frameworks.

Method: The authors propose DEER, a speculative decoding framework that combines diffusion large language models (dLLM) for drafting and AR models for verification. It includes a two-stage training pipeline to align the drafter and target model and uses single-step decoding for generating long draft segments.

Result: DEER achieves performance improvements, including draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens (vs. 10 tokens by EAGLE-3) and a 5.54x speedup on HumanEval with the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, compared to EAGLE-3's 2.41x.

Conclusion: DEER demonstrates that diffusion models can address inefficiencies and trust deficits inherent in AR-based speculative decoding, achieving superior speedups and drafting performance. The framework holds significant potential for improving the efficiency of LLM-driven reasoning systems.

Abstract: Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/

*Liyu Zhang,Yejia Liu,Kwun Ho Liu,Runxi Huang,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chorus, a context-aware model adaptation method for IoT applications that handles unseen deployment conditions without relying on target-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT sensor data is often influenced by dynamic and diverse contexts, such as sensor placements and ambient environments, which challenge the generalization of traditional methods in handling unseen context shifts after deployment.

Method: Chorus utilizes context-aware, data-free model customization by learning robust context representations through unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction and regularization. It dynamically integrates sensor and context information using a lightweight gated head and reduces inference latency via a context-caching mechanism.

Result: Chorus demonstrates up to 11.3% improved performance in unseen contexts across various tasks like IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing, while maintaining comparable latency on edge and smartphone devices.

Conclusion: Chorus effectively adapts to unseen dynamic contexts in IoT applications, outperforming current methods by leveraging robust context representation and efficient adaptation mechanisms.

Abstract: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome deficiencies in machine learning potential (MLIP) models that result from training datasets limited to near-equilibrium structures, leading to unreliable adsorption energy predictions.

Method: DBCata utilizes a deep generative approach combining a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network, enabling transitions between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures without explicit energy or force information.

Result: DBCata achieves superior performance with a DMAE of 0.035 Å, outperforming other models, and improves DFT accuracy within 0.1 eV in 94% of cases using hybrid outlier detection.

Conclusion: DBCata enhances high-throughput computational screening for alloy catalysts, proving itself as a powerful and precise tool for catalytic design and optimization.

Abstract: The adsorption energy serves as a crucial descriptor for the large-scale screening of catalysts. Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.

In particular, we develop a novel centroid refinement decoder whose usefulness is assessed through a rigorous ablation study. Our system provides key advantages over existing methods: a hyperparameter-free solution compared to unsupervised clustering approaches, and a more efficient alternative to current online end-to-end methods, which are computationally costly. We demonstrate that O-EENC-SD is competitive with the state of the art in the two-speaker conversational telephone speech domain, as tested on the CallHome dataset. Our results show that O-EENC-SD provides a great trade-off between DER and complexity, even when working on independent chunks with no overlap, making the system extremely efficient.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes to model time-varying sets of vectors, providing interpretable representations of their temporal evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of analyzing the temporal evolution of complex, structured data, such as ecosystem structures, crime distributions, and word embeddings, which require robust methods due to their dynamic and intricate nature.

Method: The proposed method models vector distributions using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes, approximating them with Random Fourier Features to create comparable, compact representations over time.

Result: The method effectively captures temporal dynamics in sociological (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), offering robust and interpretable results.

Conclusion: The approach serves as a versatile framework for analyzing structural changes in evolving vector sets across various domains, making the temporal transitions analyzable and visualizable.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.

Result: The approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition, showcasing improved downstream learning despite limited labeled data.

Conclusion: Well-designed physiological encoders with simple fusion enable scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing applications.

Abstract: Physiological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) provide complementary insights into human health and cognition, yet multi-modal integration is challenging due to limited multi-modal labeled data, and modality-specific differences . In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD), a continual learning framework that improves sparse neural systems' performance by selectively distilling knowledge from highly activated neurons, preserving modularity and enabling structural realignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in sparse neural systems, such as limited cross-task knowledge reuse and performance drops under high sparsity, particularly in the context of continual learning.

Method: Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD) selectively identifies highly active neurons and distills knowledge within task-specific Top-K subnetworks and logits without requiring replay or task labels. This offers a structurally guided approach to continual learning.

Result: The proposed SSD method demonstrated improved accuracy, information retention, and representation coverage in experiments on datasets like Split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST.

Conclusion: SSD enhances the adaptability and efficiency of sparse neural systems in continual learning scenarios by selectively distilling essential knowledge while maintaining modularity.

Abstract: Sparse neural systems are gaining traction for efficient continual learning due to their modularity and low interference. Architectures such as Sparse Distributed Memory Multi-Layer Perceptrons (SDMLP) construct task-specific subnetworks via Top-K activation and have shown resilience against catastrophic forgetting. However, their rigid modularity limits cross-task knowledge reuse and leads to performance degradation under high sparsity. We propose Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD), a structurally guided continual learning framework that treats distillation not as a regularizer but as a topology-aligned information conduit. SSD identifies neurons with high activation frequency and selectively distills knowledge within previous Top-K subnetworks and output logits, without requiring replay or task labels. This enables structural realignment while preserving sparse modularity. Experiments on Split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST demonstrate that SSD improves accuracy, retention, and representation coverage, offering a structurally grounded solution for sparse continual learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating embedding quality in unsupervised models without relying on labeled data.

Method: A new metric, Persistence, is developed using persistent homology to measure topological and geometric structure of embeddings.

Result: Persistence demonstrates strong correlations with downstream performance and outperforms other unsupervised metrics.

Conclusion: Persistence is a reliable tool for evaluating embedding spaces and supports model and hyperparameter selection in unsupervised learning.

Abstract: Modern representation learning increasingly relies on unsupervised and self-supervised methods trained on large-scale unlabeled data. While these approaches achieve impressive generalization across tasks and domains, evaluating embedding quality without labels remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Persistence, a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies the geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces in a fully unsupervised manner. Unlike metrics that assume linear separability or rely on covariance structure, Persistence captures global and multi-scale organization. Empirical results across diverse domains show that Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.

### [226] [Bits for Privacy: Evaluating Post-Training Quantization via Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15335)
*Chenxiang Zhang,Tongxi Qu,Zhong Li,Tian Zhang,Jun Pang,Sjouke Mauw*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study examines the privacy-utility trade-offs in low-precision quantization of deep neural networks through membership inference attacks, revealing reduced privacy leakage in low-precision models but with decreased utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how quantization, a tool for reducing memory and computational costs in neural networks, impacts privacy leakage given the insufficient focus on low-precision models in existing privacy studies.

Method: Membership inference attacks were used to evaluate three post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms (AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC) across various bit-widths on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet.

Result: Low-precision PTQs substantially reduce privacy leakage compared to full-precision models but result in reduced performance. For instance, lower precision models showed up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability.

Conclusion: Practitioners can leverage low-precision quantization to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy, with specific strategies like higher precision in final layers enabling improved control over trade-offs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.

*Hiroyoshi Nagahama,Katsufumi Inoue,Masayoshi Todorokihara,Michifumi Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two strategies for phase-aware preprocessing of vibration signals in machine predictive maintenance, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in leveraging phase information in vibration signals for predictive maintenance and improving the accuracy of fault detection in rotating machinery.

Method: The authors propose two phase-aware pre-processing strategies: (1) aligning each axis of vibration data individually to zero phase, and (2) using a single-axis reference adjustment that maintains inter-axis relationships. They tested these on a custom rotor dataset using deep learning architectures.

Result: Both approaches showed architecture-independent performance gains, with the single-axis reference method achieving up to 96.2% accuracy, a +5.4% improvement.

Conclusion: Phase-aware preprocessing enhances the performance of predictive maintenance systems, making it a practical, scalable solution for improving accuracy in machine fault detection.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.

*Julian Oelhaf,Mehran Pashaei,Georg Kordowich,Christian Bergler,Andreas Maier,Johann Jäger,Siming Bayer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework to assess the robustness of machine learning models in power system protection under various sensor data degradation conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of traditional power system protection schemes which struggle with the growing integration of renewable and distributed generation, and need adaptive, robust ML-based alternatives.

Method: High-fidelity EMT simulations were employed to model realistic sensor data degradation scenarios like outages, reduced sampling rates, and communication losses. A unified framework evaluates and benchmarks the robustness of ML models under these conditions.

Result: Fault classification (FC) remains stable under most degradation scenarios but experiences a 13% performance drop in single-phase loss. Fault localization (FL) is more sensitive, with voltage loss causing a 150% increase in error.

Conclusion: The framework provides critical insights enabling the design of robustness-aware ML-based protection systems for future power grids. It highlights the variability in model performance under different degradation scenarios.

Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, "EUBRL," designed to overcome exploration-exploitation dilemmas via epistemic uncertainty guidance, achieving superior efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning by using epistemic uncertainty to enhance decision-making.

Method: Developed "EUBRL," a Bayesian RL algorithm that uses epistemic uncertainty for principled exploration and reduces per-step regret in infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

Result: Proposed algorithm "EUBRL" is empirically evaluated and shown to perform better in tasks with sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochastic conditions, achieving improved sample efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: By integrating epistemic guidance, "EUBRL" effectively minimizes regret and achieves robust exploration, demonstrating its potential value in reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: At the boundary between the known and the unknown, an agent inevitably confronts the dilemma of whether to explore or to exploit. Epistemic uncertainty reflects such boundaries, representing systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, $\texttt{EUBRL}$, which leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. This guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors. We establish nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically, we evaluate $\texttt{EUBRL}$ on tasks characterized by sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity. Results demonstrate that $\texttt{EUBRL}$ achieves superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency.

*Yeonwoo Cha,Semin Kim,Jinhyeon Kwon,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowBind is a method for any-to-any cross-modal generation, offering efficiency and competitive quality by using a shared latent space and invertible flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for any-to-any generation are inefficient due to reliance on large datasets, high computational costs, and complex multi-stage training.

Method: FlowBind introduces a shared latent space for cross-modal interactions, connected to modality-specific flows. These flows act as encoders and decoders, optimized under a single flow-matching objective.

Result: FlowBind reduces parameter needs by up to 6x, trains 10x faster, and delivers results on par with state-of-the-art methods across text, image, and audio.

Conclusion: FlowBind simplifies the any-to-any generation process, making it efficient by requiring fewer resources while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Any-to-any generation seeks to translate between arbitrary subsets of modalities, enabling flexible cross-modal synthesis. Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding normalized eigenvalues in random matrices and their statistical properties can enhance applications in data science and machine learning, given their ubiquitous use in normalized inputs.

Method: The study proposes and evaluates a cumulative scaling law for normalized eigenvalues and derives residual errors during matrix factorization, validated by numerical experiments.

Result: The research confirms theoretical predictions regarding normalized eigenvalue distributions and residual errors through numerical data verification.

Conclusion: Min-max normalized eigenvalues display consistent statistical properties, scaling laws, and predictable errors during random matrix computations, useful for theoretical and practical applications.

Abstract: Random matrix theory has played an important role in various areas of pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and machine learning. From a practical perspective of data science, input data are usually normalized prior to processing. Thus, this study investigates the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices. Previously, the effective distribution for such normalized eigenvalues has been proposed. In this study, we apply it to evaluate a scaling law of the cumulative distribution. Furthermore, we derive the residual error that arises during matrix factorization of random matrices. We conducted numerical experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FM-EAC, a reinforcement learning algorithm combining model-based and model-free methods for improved task transferability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern RL methods struggle with transferring knowledge across tasks and scenarios, limiting their applicability in dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed FM-EAC integrates planning, acting, and learning using feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework for multi-task control.

Result: Simulations in urban and agricultural domains show that FM-EAC outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods while offering sub-network customization.

Conclusion: The FM-EAC framework demonstrates improved generalizability and adaptability, addressing key limitations in current reinforcement learning approaches.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) evolve along distinct paths but converge in the design of Dyna-Q [1]. However, modern RL methods still struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a generalized algorithm, Feature Model-Based Enhanced Actor-Critic (FM-EAC), that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments. FM-EAC combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL and improves generalizability through the use of novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework. Simulations in both urban and agricultural applications demonstrate that FM-EAC consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods. More importantly, different sub-networks can be customized within FM-EAC according to user-specific requirements.

### [233] [Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15439)
*Akihiro Kubo,Paavo Parmas,Shin Ishii*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO) separates rollouts into long distribution rollouts (DR) to mitigate distribution shift and short training rollouts (TR) for stable gradient estimation, achieving better performance in continuous-control benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the dilemma of choosing rollout lengths in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to mitigate distribution shift, reduce model bias, and maintain stable gradient estimates.

Method: Proposed DHMBPO, dividing rollouts into long distribution rollouts (DR) for on-policy state sampling and short training rollouts (TR) for accurate and stable gradient estimation.

Result: DHMBPO effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, outperforming existing MBRL methods in sample efficiency and runtime on continuous-control benchmarks.

Conclusion: Separating rollouts into dual horizons can resolve conflicts in rollout length optimization, improving both reinforcement learning efficiency and runtime stability.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long "distribution rollout" (DR) and a short "training rollout" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to reduce the generation of copyrighted content in text-to-image models through chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting, along with negative prompting and prompt re-writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over text-to-image models inadvertently reproducing copyrighted material, which raises legal and financial risks, motivate the need to explore mitigation strategies.

Method: The authors propose a combination of chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting with negative prompting and prompt re-writing. They analyze these methods' performance experimentally across different models.

Result: Numerical experiments reveal insights into the effectiveness of these techniques in reducing copyrighted content reproduction while maintaining relevance to user inputs.

Conclusion: The study highlights promising strategies to mitigate copyright risks in text-to-image models, balancing content regulation and prompt relevance.

Abstract: Large scale text-to-image generation models can memorize and reproduce their training dataset. Since the training dataset often contains copyrighted material, reproduction of training dataset poses a copyright infringement risk, which could result in legal liabilities and financial losses for both the AI user and the developer. The current works explores the potential of chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting in reducing copyrighted content generation. To this end, we present a formulation that combines these two techniques with two other copyright mitigation strategies: a) negative prompting, and b) prompt re-writing. We study the generated images in terms their similarity to a copyrighted image and their relevance of the user input. We present numerical experiments on a variety of models and provide insights on the effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques for varying model complexity.

*Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li,Yufei Han,Bin Wang,Jiqiang Liu,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to theoretically quantify and assess the risk of Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) in Federated Learning (FL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework to evaluate the risk of Data Reconstruction Attacks in Federated Learning.

Method: The study introduces Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) as a metric for DRA risk, derives a tight upper bound for it, develops an attack-agnostic risk estimator (InvRE), and proposes adaptive noise-based defenses to improve privacy in FL systems.

Result: The proposed framework systematically quantifies DRA risks using InvRE and validates its effectiveness via experiments on real-world datasets. The proposed defenses improved privacy without affecting accuracy.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified theoretical explanation and practical solutions for evaluating and mitigating DRA risks, enhancing privacy in Federated Learning systems.

Abstract: Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.

*Ioannis Kalogeropoulos,Giorgos Bouritsas,Yannis Panagakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to efficiently edit neural networks (NNs) to meet various requirements without compromising their utility. It uses a graph metanetwork to make edits in a single inference step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of deploying machine learning models in high-stakes settings while ensuring they satisfy requirements like fairness and regulations without compromising their performance.

Method: The method involves using a graph metanetwork as an editor, trained on NN populations to optimize two objectives: enforcing requirements and preserving NN utility. Edits are performed in a single inference step.

Result: The proposed framework improves trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction, and computational efficiency on tasks like data minimization, bias mitigation, and weight pruning compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that their framework can successfully and efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements without sacrificing their utility, offering an alternative to post-processing and re-training.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, e.g. as decision support systems in various societal sectors or in critical infrastructure, designers and auditors are facing the need to ensure that models satisfy a wider variety of requirements (e.g. compliance with regulations, fairness, computational constraints) beyond performance. Although most of them are the subject of ongoing studies, typical approaches face critical challenges: post-processing methods tend to compromise performance, which is often counteracted by fine-tuning or, worse, training from scratch, an often time-consuming or even unavailable strategy. This raises the following question: "Can we efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements, without sacrificing their utility?" In this work, we approach this with a unifying framework, in a data-driven manner, i.e. we learn to edit neural networks (NNs), where the editor is an NN itself - a graph metanetwork - and editing amounts to a single inference step. In particular, the metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimise an objective consisting of two terms: the requirement to be enforced and the preservation of the NN's utility. We experiment with diverse tasks (the data minimisation principle, bias mitigation and weight pruning) improving the trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction and time efficiency compared to popular post-processing or re-training alternatives.

*Luca Torresi,Pascal Friederich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced Bayesian optimization approach for self-driving labs (SDLs), enabling adaptive multi-stage workflows with intermediate proxy measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Bayesian optimization methods limit SDLs by requiring fixed workflows and measurable objective functions, restricting application to more complex experimental scenarios.

Method: The authors extend standard Bayesian optimization to incorporate flexible workflows and proxy measurements for decision-making during intermediate stages.

Result: Using proxy measurements significantly enhances the speed and optimality of solutions across diverse scenarios compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The approach improves SDLs' ability to handle complex workflows, merge simulation and experimentation, and achieve efficient autonomous experimentation.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are combining recent technological advances in robotics, automation, and machine learning based data analysis and decision-making to perform autonomous experimentation toward human-directed goals without requiring any direct human intervention. SDLs are successfully used in materials science, chemistry, and beyond, to optimise processes, materials, and devices in a systematic and data-efficient way. At present, the most widely used algorithm to identify the most informative next experiment is Bayesian optimisation. While relatively simple to apply to a wide range of optimisation problems, standard Bayesian optimisation relies on a fixed experimental workflow with a clear set of optimisation parameters and one or more measurable objective functions. This excludes the possibility of making on-the-fly decisions about changes in the planned sequence of operations and including intermediate measurements in the decision-making process. Therefore, many real-world experiments need to be adapted and simplified to be converted to the common setting in self-driving labs. In this paper, we introduce an extension to Bayesian optimisation that allows flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows and makes optimal decisions based on intermediate observables, which we call proxy measurements. We systematically compare the advantage of taking into account proxy measurements over conventional Bayesian optimisation, in which only the final measurement is observed. We find that over a wide range of scenarios, proxy measurements yield a substantial improvement, both in the time to find good solutions and in the overall optimality of found solutions. This not only paves the way to use more complex and thus more realistic experimental workflows in autonomous labs but also to smoothly combine simulations and experiments in the next generation of SDLs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the reliability assessment of classifiers by exploring two conceptually different approaches, RQ and UQ, and determining their relative strengths and complementarities.

Method: Comparison of RQ and UQ on various benchmark datasets, followed by the integration of these methods to design a hybrid approach.

Result: The hybrid approach outperforms both RQ and UQ independently, and the study provides insights into the significance of uncertainty and robustness for reliability on different datasets.

Conclusion: Combining robustness and uncertainty quantification creates a more reliable approach to classifier prediction, emphasizing the importance of both robustness and uncertainty as reliability factors.

Abstract: We consider two conceptually different approaches for assessing the reliability of the individual predictions of a classifier: Robustness Quantification (RQ) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). We compare both approaches on a number of benchmark datasets and show that there is no clear winner between the two, but that they are complementary and can be combined to obtain a hybrid approach that outperforms both RQ and UQ. As a byproduct of our approach, for each dataset, we also obtain an assessment of the relative importance of uncertainty and robustness as sources of unreliability.

*Yuxin Cai,Yanyong Huang,Jinyuan Chang,Dongjie Wang,Tianrui Li,Xiaoyi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method (JUICE) for joint feature and instance co-selection and missing data imputation in unlabeled incomplete multi-view datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat co-selection and missing data imputation as independent, failing to utilize their interactions, and overlook the complementary information in multi-view data.

Method: A unified approach (JUICE) incorporates missing data recovery with feature and instance co-selection, using cross-view neighborhood information to improve imputation and selection.

Result: JUICE achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: JUICE effectively combines co-selection and imputation processes, demonstrating its utility in processing multi-view data.

Abstract: Feature and instance co-selection, which aims to reduce both feature dimensionality and sample size by identifying the most informative features and instances, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Shuibai Zhang,Fred Zhangzhi Peng,Yiheng Zhang,Jin Pan,Grigorios G. Chrysos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of iterative error correction in diffusion language models (DLMs), proposing a correction-focused post-training method to enhance their capability in refining incorrect tokens while preserving correct ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models are suitable for error correction due to their non-causal denoising dynamics. However, standard training methods fail to ensure models assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and refine them iteratively.

Method: The authors proposed a post-training approach for DLMs that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens during training to enable better error localization and refinement. They also introduced the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB) to evaluate the model’s corrective abilities.

Result: The proposed approach significantly improves models’ error correction and code revision performance in controlled tasks compared to standard masked diffusion language models. It also enhances pure completion tasks.

Conclusion: Explicitly focusing on refining incorrect tokens in diffusion language models boosts their error correction performance and overall utility in sequence modeling tasks, demonstrated via their new benchmark and evaluation results.

Abstract: Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangshuibai/CDLM.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance graph message-passing mechanisms by moving beyond pairwise interactions to higher-order interactions while managing computational costs.

Method: The authors introduce N-simplicial attention, adapt it for RoPE, and propose a cost-effective simplex selection to prioritize task-relevant interactions.

Result: They derive a Lipschitz upper-bound for N-simplicial attention to study smoothing and show it suffers from over-smoothing, even with higher-order interactions.

Conclusion: N-simplicial attention expands the scope of attention mechanisms but still requires careful management of smoothing and complexity for optimal performance.

Abstract: Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, and adapt it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). To help manage the increased complexity, we propose a cost-effective simplex selection enabling the model to focus its computation load onto the more task-sensitive interactions. Beyond these core mechanisms, we study how smoothing N-simplicial attention is by deriving a Lipschitz upper-bound and by demonstrating that by itself it also suffers from over-smoothing, despite opening the attention message-passing to higher-order interactions.

### [242] [Behavior Tokens Speak Louder: Disentangled Explainable Recommendation with Behavior Vocabulary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15614)
*Xinshun Feng,Mingzhe Liu,Yi Qiao,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEAT, a behavior-tokenization framework that enhances explainable recommendations by bridging intricate user behaviors with language model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use ID-based representations that ignore semantic meaning and limit applicability in real-world interactions with complex user intents and misaligned semantics.

Method: BEAT tokenizes user-item behaviors using a vector-quantized autoencoder to create interpretable sequences, supplemented with multi-level semantic supervision and semantic alignment regularization.

Result: BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance across three datasets while generating coherent and informative explanations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully captures fine-grained semantics and integrates complex user behaviors with language models in a transferable manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in explainable recommendations have explored the integration of language models to analyze natural language rationales for user-item interactions. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.

*Tianze Luo,Haotian Yuan,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces Solution Flow Models (SoFlow) aimed at one-step generation, addressing efficiency issues in diffusion and Flow Matching models by employing tailored loss functions and achieving better performance compared to MeanFlow models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency caused by multi-step denoising in diffusion and Flow Matching models spurred the need for a more efficient generation method, inspiring the development of one-step generation.

Method: The authors developed Solution Flow Models (SoFlow) that use a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss for training, eliminating the inefficiency of Jacobian-vector products required in previous works.

Result: SoFlow achieved better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models when trained on ImageNet 256x256 while using the same Diffusion Transformer architecture and training epochs.

Conclusion: SoFlow provides an efficient and improved alternative to current models, demonstrating the potential of one-step generation for practical applications.

Abstract: The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

*Oleg Melnikov,Yurii Dorofieiev,Yurii Shakhnovskiy,Huy Truong,Victoria Degeler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SICAMS, a framework for detecting and classifying anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an effective approach for identifying leaks, sensor malfunctions, and other anomalies in water distribution networks without relying on a calibrated hydraulic model.

Method: Utilizes multivariate statistical analysis, particularly the Hotelling's T^2 statistic, combined with whitening transformations and heuristic algorithms to detect, classify, and approximately localize anomalies.

Result: Demonstrates high sensitivity in leak detection using the BattLeDIM L-Town dataset, maintaining reliability even under multiple anomalies.

Conclusion: SICAMS proves practical for real-world applications in monitoring water distribution networks, offering robust anomaly detection without requiring calibrated models.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.

*Zhenwen Liang,Sidi Lu,Wenhao Yu,Kishan Panaganti,Yujun Zhou,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2RL introduces gradient-aware exploration for reinforcement learning in large language models to improve reasoning, achieving better results over traditional entropy and external comparator methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current exploration mechanisms in reinforcement learning for language models fail to align with the models' optimization process, focusing only on surface-level variations without guaranteeing meaningful updates.

Method: G2RL uses the model's own gradient information to guide exploration. It evaluates how new responses impact gradients and rewards trajectories introducing diverse updates while demoting redundant ones. This process is integrated with PPO stabilization techniques.

Result: Experimentally, G2RL outperforms entropy-based GRPO and external comparator methods in benchmarks like MATH500 and MMLUpro, showing consistent gains in evaluation metrics such as pass@1 and maj@16 with different model sizes.

Conclusion: Gradient-guided exploration offers a more aligned and effective strategy for reinforcement learning in language models, enhancing exploration while maintaining semantic coherence and policy stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.

### [246] [Multi-Modal Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15691)
*Matin Mortaheb,Erciyes Karakaya,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to enhance image data transmission for task-specific objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional semantic communication techniques often struggle with identifying task-relevant information, particularly in complex scenes with multiple objects due to a lack of explicit task guidance.

Method: A Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework is proposed, employing a cross-modal attention mechanism to fuse visual data with text-based user queries. This system generates relevance scores to prioritize data transmission and adaptively encodes image patches for efficient transmission.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates the ability to adapt image patch transmissions based on relevance scores and channel bandwidth, ensuring efficient and goal-driven data communication.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables flexible, efficient, and task-focused semantic communication, even in environments with complex visual scenes and bandwidth constraints.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.

*Kayode Olumoyin,Lamees El Naqa,Katarzyna Rejniak*

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method using physics-informed neural networks to model evolving interactions and predict subpopulation dynamics in biological systems like cancer tumors, especially when there is limited experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models with fixed parameters fail to capture the evolving dynamics of biological systems influenced by external interventions. In oncology, this is complicated further due to sparse experimental data, calling for new approaches.

Method: The authors developed a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to infer time-varying interactions between cancer tumors (e.g., bladder cancer) and immune cells, while predicting subpopulation dynamics in scenarios with limited data.

Result: The approach succeeded in predicting subpopulation trajectories at unobserved time points, aligning with biological expectations of these dynamics.

Conclusion: The PINN framework proves to be a viable tool for studying the evolving interactions in biological systems under external influences, providing insights even with sparse data.

Abstract: In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.

Motivation: To address the limitations of static deep learning models with fixed topologies and high energy consumption in physiological signal monitoring.

Method: Developed SGEMAS, a thermodynamic-based system using structural plasticity and variational free energy minimization, evolving dynamically to minimize prediction error with high sparsity.

Result: SGEMAS v3.3 achieved a mean AUC of 0.570 ± 0.070 in a challenging inter-patient, zero-shot anomaly detection task, outperforming simpler variants and an autoencoder baseline.

Conclusion: Physics-based, energy-constrained architectures like SGEMAS can provide efficient and robust performance in biomedical anomaly detection, marking a step towards sustainable AI models.

Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for physiological signal monitoring suffer from static topologies and constant energy consumption. We introduce SGEMAS (Self-Growing Ephemeral Multi-Agent System), a bio-inspired architecture that treats intelligence as a dynamic thermodynamic process. By coupling a structural plasticity mechanism (agent birth death) to a variational free energy objective, the system naturally evolves to minimize prediction error with extreme sparsity. An ablation study on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database reveals that adding a multi-scale instability index to the agent dynamics significantly improves performance. In a challenging inter-patient, zero-shot setting, the final SGEMAS v3.3 model achieves a mean AUC of 0.570 +- 0.070, outperforming both its simpler variants and a standard autoencoder baseline. This result validates that a physics-based, energy-constrained model can achieve robust unsupervised anomaly detection, offering a promising direction for efficient biomedical AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neuromorphic system using coupled oscillators for autonomous learning, validated through simulations and hardware, enabling continuous analog computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a hardware platform for energy-efficient, autonomous neuromorphic computing with integrated learning and inference.

Method: Networks of coupled Wien bridge oscillators with Hebbian learning rules were employed. Simulations and hardware tests validated phase pattern learning as attractor states.

Result: Demonstrated phase relationships encoding patterns, validated continuous learning and recall, and showed transient state energy reshaping upon input changes.

Conclusion: Coupled oscillator circuits are promising for energy-based neuromorphic computing enabling seamless learning and inference through analog dynamics.

Abstract: We present an oscillatory neuromorphic primitive implemented with networks of coupled Wien bridge oscillators and tunable resistive couplings. Phase relationships between oscillators encode patterns, and a local Hebbian learning rule continuously adapts the couplings, allowing learning and recall to emerge from the same ongoing analog dynamics rather than from separate training and inference phases. Using a Kuramoto-style phase model with an effective energy function, we show that learned phase patterns form attractor states and validate this behavior in simulation and hardware. We further realize a 2-4-2 architecture with a hidden layer of oscillators, whose bipartite visible-hidden coupling allows multiple internal configurations to produce the same visible phase states. When inputs are switched, transient spikes in energy followed by relaxation indicate how the network can reduce surprise by reshaping its energy landscape. These results support coupled oscillator circuits as a hardware platform for energy-based neuromorphic computing with autonomous, continuous learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems face computational limitations with digital hardware, driving interest in alternate scalable paradigms.

Method: The paper proposes analog accelerator design using DenseAM implemented via RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers.

Result: Their analog DenseAM hardware achieves inference in constant time, irrespective of model size, which is more efficient than digital systems.

Conclusion: Analog DenseAM accelerators can leverage continuous operation and hardware parallelism to enable ultrafast AI computations.

Abstract: The increasing computational demands of modern AI systems have exposed fundamental limitations of digital hardware, driving interest in alternative paradigms for efficient large-scale inference. Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) is a family of models that offers a flexible framework for representing many contemporary neural architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, by casting them as dynamical systems evolving on an energy landscape. In this work, we propose a general method for building analog accelerators for DenseAMs and implementing them using electronic RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers. We find that our analog DenseAM hardware performs inference in constant time independent of model size. This result highlights an asymptotic advantage of analog DenseAMs over digital numerical solvers that scale at least linearly with the model size. We consider three settings of progressively increasing complexity: XOR, the Hamming (7,4) code, and a simple language model defined on binary variables. We propose analog implementations of these three models and analyze the scaling of inference time, energy consumption, and hardware. Finally, we estimate lower bounds on the achievable time constants imposed by amplifier specifications, suggesting that even conservative existing analog technology can enable inference times on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. By harnessing the intrinsic parallelism and continuous-time operation of analog circuits, our DenseAM-based accelerator design offers a new avenue for fast and scalable AI hardware.

TL;DR: Q-MetaSur is a novel surrogate modeling scheme based on a language model approach designed for multi-task-multi-objective optimization (MTMOO) problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surrogate models struggle with complex optimization problems involving multiple sub-objectives due to the repetitive nature of approximation.

Method: The method involves transforming objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling using a large language model. A two-stage training process combines supervised tuning with reinforcement learning fine-tuning for better generalization.

Result: Q-MetaSur demonstrated superior performance in objective approximation accuracy and improved optimization convergence on the CEC2019 benchmark compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Q-MetaSur is an effective and generalizable surrogate modeling approach that enhances evolutionary algorithms for complex optimization tasks.

Abstract: Data-driven evolutionary algorithms has shown surprising results in addressing expensive optimization problems through robust surrogate modeling. Though promising, existing surrogate modeling schemes may encounter limitations in complex optimization problems with many sub-objectives, which rely on repeated and tedious approximation. To address such technical gap, we propose Q-MetaSur as a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme capable of providing unified and generalized surrogate learning. Specifically, we consider multi-task-multi-objective optimization~(MTMOO) in offline setting. Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance. Extensive empirical results on the CEC2019 benchmark demonstrate that Q-MetaSur not only outperforms representative surrogate baselines in objective approximation accuracy, but also helps underlying evolutionary algorithms achieve both desired optimization convergence and improved pareto optimality.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that their approaches effectively optimize virtual network function placement, making data centers more energy efficient and scalable to very large instances.

Abstract: Modern data centers contain thousands of servers making them major consumers of electricity. To minimize their environmental impact, it is critical that we use their resources efficiently. In this paper we study how to discover the optimal placement of virtual network functions in large scale data centers. We propose a novel parallel metaheuristic, fast heuristic objective functions of the QoS and new memory efficient data structures for large networks. We further identify a simple, fast heuristic that can produce competitive solutions to very large problem instances. Using these new concepts, we are able to find high quality solutions for data centres with up to 64,000 servers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the use of natural language programming by allowing seamless integration and interaction between natural language code and traditional programming constructs.

Method: The authors propose a shared program state abstraction, allowing natural language code to directly interact with and modify program variables and objects. This is incorporated into a schema and implemented in the Nightjar programming system.

Result: Nightjar improves task accuracy by 4-19% while reducing code size by 39.6%. However, it incurs runtime overhead, up to 4.3 times slower than manual implementations.

Conclusion: Nightjar demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of integrating natural language programming with formal languages, simplifying programming while maintaining accuracy but at the cost of runtime efficiency.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new type of programming: natural language programming. By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute.
  An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface.
  We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).

Motivation: The study aims to enhance the user embodiment experience in robotic systems by exploring the role of synchronized physiological signals, specifically breathing.

Method: Through a within-subjects experiment, participants controlled a robotic arm in synchronized or non-synchronized states with their breath to examine the effects on embodiment.

Result: Synchronization of breath with robotic movement significantly increased body ownership and was preferred by most participants.

Conclusion: The representation of physiological signals, like breathing, opens new pathways for improving human-robot interaction, with implications for telepresence, prosthetics, collaboration, and shared autonomy.

Abstract: Embodiment of users within robotic systems has been explored in human-robot interaction, most often in telepresence and teleoperation. In these applications, synchronized visuomotor feedback can evoke a sense of body ownership and agency, contributing to the experience of embodiment. We extend this work by employing embreathment, the representation of the user's own breath in real time, as a means for enhancing user embodiment experience in robots. In a within-subjects experiment, participants controlled a robotic arm, while its movements were either synchronized or non-synchronized with their own breath. Synchrony was shown to significantly increase body ownership, and was preferred by most participants. We propose the representation of physiological signals as a novel interoceptive pathway for human-robot interaction, and discuss implications for telepresence, prosthetics, collaboration with robots, and shared autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based imitation learning struggles with low training efficiency and poor generalization due to reliance on object appearance rather than 3D scene structure.

Method: Introduces a diffusion policy (ISS Policy) based on DiT, coupled with an implicit scene supervision module to enhance geometric consistency and robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MetaWorld and Adroit benchmarks, and demonstrates generalization and robustness in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Implicit Scene Supervision improves model performance, scales effectively, and serves as a promising approach for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-based imitation learning has enabled impressive robotic manipulation skills, but its reliance on object appearance while ignoring the underlying 3D scene structure leads to low training efficiency and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Implicit Scene Supervision (ISS) Policy}, a 3D visuomotor DiT-based diffusion policy that predicts sequences of continuous actions from point cloud observations. We extend DiT with a novel implicit scene supervision module that encourages the model to produce outputs consistent with the scene's geometric evolution, thereby improving the performance and robustness of the policy. Notably, ISS Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-arm manipulation tasks (MetaWorld) and dexterous hand manipulation (Adroit). In real-world experiments, it also demonstrates strong generalization and robustness. Additional ablation studies show that our method scales effectively with both data and parameters. Code and videos will be released.

TL;DR: This paper proposes HERO, a framework for Hierarchical Traversable 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs), enabling better navigation in dynamic environments through operable obstacle modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior 3DSGs assume static environments, limiting navigation efficiency by treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable, undermining real-world applicability.

Method: The HERO framework redefines traversability using hierarchical 3DSGs that account for the physical interactivity and semantics of obstacles, modeling them as pathways for improved scene understanding.

Result: HERO achieves a 35.1% reduction in path length (PL) in partially obstructed environments and a 79.4% increase in success rate (SR) in fully obstructed environments compared to baselines.

Conclusion: HERO significantly enhances navigation efficiency and reachability in dynamic environments, addressing key limitations of prior static-world 3DSG models.

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs) constitute a powerful representation of the physical world, distinguished by their abilities to explicitly model the complex spatial, semantic, and functional relationships between entities, rendering a foundational understanding that enables agents to interact intelligently with their environment and execute versatile behaviors. Embodied navigation, as a crucial component of such capabilities, leverages the compact and expressive nature of 3DSGs to enable long-horizon reasoning and planning in complex, large-scale environments. However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility. To address these issues, we propose HERO, a novel framework for constructing Hierarchical Traversable 3DSGs, that redefines traversability by modeling operable obstacles as pathways, capturing their physical interactivity, functional semantics, and the scene's relational hierarchy. The results show that, relative to its baseline, HERO reduces PL by 35.1% in partially obstructed environments and increases SR by 79.4% in fully obstructed ones, demonstrating substantially higher efficiency and reachability.

Conclusion: NAP3D enhances pose estimation accuracy and complements existing SLAM pipelines when conventional loop closure is unavailable, making it a robust, lightweight, and dataset-agnostic tool.

Abstract: Accurate localization is essential for autonomous vehicles, yet sensor noise and drift over time can lead to significant pose estimation errors, particularly in long-horizon environments. A common strategy for correcting accumulated error is visual loop closure in SLAM, which adjusts the pose graph when the agent revisits previously mapped locations. These techniques typically rely on identifying visual mappings between the current view and previously observed scenes and often require fusing data from multiple sensors.
  In contrast, this work introduces NeRF-Assisted 3D-3D Pose Alignment (NAP3D), a complementary approach that leverages 3D-3D correspondences between the agent's current depth image and a pre-trained Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). By directly aligning 3D points from the observed scene with synthesized points from the NeRF, NAP3D refines the estimated pose even from novel viewpoints, without relying on revisiting previously observed locations.
  This robust 3D-3D formulation provides advantages over conventional 2D-3D localization methods while remaining comparable in accuracy and applicability. Experiments demonstrate that NAP3D achieves camera pose correction within 5 cm on a custom dataset, robustly outperforming a 2D-3D Perspective-N-Point baseline. On TUM RGB-D, NAP3D consistently improves 3D alignment RMSE by approximately 6 cm compared to this baseline given varying noise, despite PnP achieving lower raw rotation and translation parameter error in some regimes, highlighting NAP3D's improved geometric consistency in 3D space. By providing a lightweight, dataset-agnostic tool, NAP3D complements existing SLAM and localization pipelines when traditional loop closure is unavailable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in GPS-free geo-localization and improve localization accuracy under dense canopy and shadows.

Method: The method constructs a bird's-eye-view feature map from onboard RGB and depth images, uses particle filter hypotheses to crop aerial patches, and computes log-likelihood by matching BEV and aerial patch features.

Result: Achieved 7.5x lower trajectory error on seen routes and 7.0x lower error on unseen routes compared to a baseline, and operates at 10 Hz in real-time.

Conclusion: BEV-Patch-PF enhances geo-localization precision without GPS, is robust to environmental challenges, and suitable for real-time robot deployment.

Abstract: We propose BEV-Patch-PF, a GPS-free sequential geo-localization system that integrates a particle filter with learned bird's-eye-view (BEV) and aerial feature maps. From onboard RGB and depth images, we construct a BEV feature map. For each 3-DoF particle pose hypothesis, we crop the corresponding patch from an aerial feature map computed from a local aerial image queried around the approximate location. BEV-Patch-PF computes a per-particle log-likelihood by matching the BEV feature to the aerial patch feature. On two real-world off-road datasets, our method achieves 7.5x lower absolute trajectory error (ATE) on seen routes and 7.0x lower ATE on unseen routes than a retrieval-based baseline, while maintaining accuracy under dense canopy and shadow. The system runs in real time at 10 Hz on an NVIDIA Tesla T4, enabling practical robot deployment.

### [259] [EPSM: A Novel Metric to Evaluate the Safety of Environmental Perception in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15195)
*Jörg Gamerdinger,Sven Teufel,Stephan Amann,Lukas Marc Listl,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel safety metric for evaluating perception systems in autonomous vehicles, focusing on object and lane detection safety rather than conventional accuracy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics like precision and recall fail to account for safety-relevant issues in perception systems, leading to potential misdetections in critical driving scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining a lightweight object safety metric and a lane safety metric that incorporates interdependencies, resulting in a unified safety score.

Result: Using the DeepAccident dataset, the approach successfully identifies safety-critical perception errors that conventional metrics overlook.

Conclusion: Safety-centric evaluation methods are essential for enhancing the reliability of perception systems in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Extensive evaluation of perception systems is crucial for ensuring the safety of intelligent vehicles in complex driving scenarios. Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving.

Motivation: Existing aerial navigation models face challenges like data domain gaps, lack of temporal reasoning, unsafe policies, and deployment constraints.

Method: The paper proposes a high-fidelity dataset, a three-stage progressive training framework, a lightweight action module with safety corrections, and optimized deployment for resource-constrained UAVs.

Result: VLA-AN achieves improved spatial grounding, reasoning, long-horizon navigation, with superior success rates and onboard inference throughput.

Conclusion: VLA-AN offers a practical, efficient solution for robust autonomous drone navigation in lightweight settings.

Abstract: This paper proposes VLA-AN, an efficient and onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework dedicated to autonomous drone navigation in complex environments. VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.

### [262] [A Network-Based Framework for Modeling and Analyzing Human-Robot Coordination Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15282)
*Martijn IJtsma,Salvatore Hargis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel computational framework to analyze and design joint human-robot work strategies, addressing the limitations of current frameworks in early-stage conceptual design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced robotic capabilities in dynamic and unstructured environments require cooperative competencies for effective human-robot collaboration.

Method: The paper introduces a framework combining functional modeling and graph-theoretic techniques to analyze coordination dynamics and evolving demands during conceptual design.

Result: The framework supports trade-space exploration, identification of cooperative competencies, and understanding coordination overhead during early design phases.

Conclusion: It enables explicit reasoning about coordination demands and cooperative competency requirements for designing human-robot systems before implementation.

Abstract: Studies of human-robot interaction in dynamic and unstructured environments show that as more advanced robotic capabilities are deployed, the need for cooperative competencies to support collaboration with human problem-holders increases. Designing human-robot systems to meet these demands requires an explicit understanding of the work functions and constraints that shape the feasibility of alternative joint work strategies. Yet existing human-robot interaction frameworks either emphasize computational support for real-time execution or rely on static representations for design, offering limited support for reasoning about coordination dynamics during early-stage conceptual design. To address this gap, this article presents a novel computational framework for analyzing joint work strategies in human-robot systems by integrating techniques from functional modeling with graph-theoretic representations. The framework characterizes collective work in terms of the relationships among system functions and the physical and informational structure of the work environment, while explicitly capturing how coordination demands evolve over time. Its use during conceptual design is demonstrated through a case study in disaster robotics, which shows how the framework can be used to support early trade-space exploration of human-robot coordination strategies and to identify cooperative competencies that support flexible management of coordination overhead. These results show how the framework makes coordination demands and their temporal evolution explicit, supporting design-time reasoning about cooperative competency requirements and work demands prior to implementation.

### [264] [Remotely Detectable Robot Policy Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15379)
*Michael Amir,Manon Flageat,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the protection of intellectual property in robotics by introducing CoNoCo, a watermarking strategy that enables remote detection of trained robotic policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of verifying ownership and detecting misuse of trained robotic policies, particularly when only remote observations (e.g., video footage) are available.

Method: The authors propose CoNoCo (Colored Noise Coherency), which embeds a spectral signal into the robot's policies using their inherent stochasticity while preserving the marginal action distribution.

Result: CoNoCo achieved robust detection across remote modalities such as motion capture and video footage, evaluated in both simulated and real-world robot experiments without degrading policy performance.

Conclusion: CoNoCo enables non-invasive, remote verification of robotic policy provenance, addressing the gap in intellectual property protection in robotic systems.

Abstract: The success of machine learning for real-world robotic systems has created a new form of intellectual property: the trained policy. This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MiVLA, a model for bridging the gap between human video data and robotic simulation data for improved generalization in vision-language-action models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLAs struggle with mismatches in camera perspectives, visual appearances, and embodiment forms. This limits their ability to generalize actions effectively across humans and robots.

Method: The authors propose MiVLA, a mutual imitation-based pre-training model that aligns human and robot behavior. It uses kinematic rules to unify human and robotic action spaces with bidirectional learning. It forecasts and mimics behaviors across embodiments for better adaptability.

Result: Experiments with three robots (ARX, PiPer, and LocoMan) show a notable improvement, with MiVLA surpassing state-of-the-art VLAs by 25% in simulation and 14% in real-world robotic tasks.

Conclusion: MiVLA effectively integrates the advantages of real-world human data and simulated robotic diversity, enhancing generalization performance for vision-language-action tasks.

Abstract: While leveraging abundant human videos and simulated robot data poses a scalable solution to the scarcity of real-world robot data, the generalization capability of existing vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains limited by mismatches in camera views, visual appearance, and embodiment morphologies. To overcome this limitation, we propose MiVLA, a generalizable VLA empowered by human-robot mutual imitation pre-training, which leverages inherent behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms to build a foundation of strong behavioral priors for both human actions and robotic control. Specifically, our method utilizes kinematic rules with left/right hand coordinate systems for bidirectional alignment between human and robot action spaces. Given human or simulated robot demonstrations, MiVLA is trained to forecast behavior trajectories for one embodiment, and imitate behaviors for another one unseen in the demonstration. Based on this mutual imitation, it integrates the behavioral fidelity of real-world human data with the manipulative diversity of simulated robot data into a unified model, thereby enhancing the generalization capability for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulation and real-world platforms with three robots (ARX, PiPer and LocoMan), demonstrate that MiVLA achieves strong improved generalization capability, outperforming state-of-the-art VLAs (e.g., $\boldsymbolπ_{0}$, $\boldsymbolπ_{0.5}$ and H-RDT) by 25% in simulation, and 14% in real-world robot control tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Load-Based Variable Transmission (LBVT) mechanism that autonomously adjusts transmission ratios for efficient robotic actuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a lightweight, efficient, and passive variable transmission system for better robotic actuation, especially for legged robots requiring dynamic torque adaptation.

Method: The LBVT mechanism utilizes a pre-tensioned spring and four-bar linkage to passively adjust transmission ratios in response to torque demands, and its performance was tested through simulations.

Result: Simulation results show the LBVT mechanism can achieve up to a 40% increase in transmission ratio at certain torque thresholds and autonomously triggers torque amplification effects when the applied force exceeds 18 N.

Conclusion: The LBVT mechanism effectively enhances robotic actuation by reducing system complexity and adapting autonomously to varying loads, making it suitable for dynamic robotic applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a Load-Based Variable Transmission (LBVT) mechanism designed to enhance robotic actuation by dynamically adjusting the transmission ratio in response to external torque demands. Unlike existing variable transmission systems that require additional actuators for active control, the proposed LBVT mechanism leverages a pre-tensioned spring and a four-bar linkage to passively modify the transmission ratio, thereby reducing the complexity of robot joint actuation systems. The effectiveness of the LBVT mechanism is evaluated through simulation-based analyses. The results confirm that the system achieves up to a 40 percent increase in transmission ratio upon reaching a predefined torque threshold, effectively amplifying joint torque when required without additional actuation. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate a torque amplification effect triggered when the applied force exceeds 18 N, highlighting the system ability to autonomously respond to varying load conditions. This research contributes to the development of lightweight, efficient, and adaptive transmission systems for robotic applications, particularly in legged robots where dynamic torque adaptation is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot localization often faces challenges when maps are created with different sensors. A reliable solution is needed for associating sensor observations with map features.

Method: The paper extends Monte Carlo Localization by incorporating vision-language features that compute observation likelihoods using camera poses and 3D maps built from RGB-D images or aligned point clouds.

Result: The method works in both indoor and outdoor scenes, evaluated on datasets like Matterport3D, Replica, and SemanticKITTI, showcasing robust associations across modalities.

Conclusion: The approach enables global robot localization that leverages visual and language cues to robustly integrate observations from varying modalities and supports initialization with natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Robust robot localization is an important prerequisite for navigation planning. If the environment map was created from different sensors, robot measurements must be robustly associated with map features. In this work, we extend Monte Carlo Localization using vision-language features. These open-vocabulary features enable to robustly compute the likelihood of visual observations, given a camera pose and a 3D map created from posed RGB-D images or aligned point clouds. The abstract vision-language features enable to associate observations and map elements from different modalities. Global localization can be initialized by natural language descriptions of the objects present in the vicinity of locations. We evaluate our approach using Matterport3D and Replica for indoor scenes and demonstrate generalization on SemanticKITTI for outdoor scenes.

Result: The toolkit was rigorously tested in labs and deployed in real-world aquatic environments up to 40m depth, proving its reliability, versatility, and applicability in prototypes such as manipulators and grippers.

Conclusion: The study provides an open, tested platform for advancing underwater robotics research, fostering innovation, reproducibility, and reducing barriers for research groups.

Abstract: Underwater robotics is becoming increasingly important for marine science, environmental monitoring, and subsea industrial operations, yet the development of underwater manipulation and actuation systems remains restricted by high costs, proprietary designs, and limited access to modular, research-oriented hardware. While open-source initiatives have democratized vehicle construction and control software, a substantial gap persists for joint-actuated systems-particularly those requiring waterproof, feedback-enabled actuation suitable for manipulators, grippers, and bioinspired devices. As a result, many research groups face lengthy development cycles, limited reproducibility, and difficulty transitioning laboratory prototypes to field-ready platforms.
  To address this gap, we introduce an open, cost-effective hardware and software toolkit for underwater manipulation research. The toolkit includes a depth-rated Underwater Robotic Joint (URJ) with early leakage detection, compact control and power management electronics, and a ROS2-based software stack for sensing and multi-mode actuation. All CAD models, fabrication files, PCB sources, firmware, and ROS2 packages are openly released, enabling local manufacturing, modification, and community-driven improvement.
  The toolkit has undergone extensive laboratory testing and multiple field deployments, demonstrating reliable operation up to 40 m depth across diverse applications, including a 3-DoF underwater manipulator, a tendon-driven soft gripper, and an underactuated sediment sampler. These results validate the robustness, versatility, and reusability of the toolkit for real marine environments.
  By providing a fully open, field-tested platform, this work aims to lower the barrier to entry for underwater manipulation research, improve reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in underwater field robotics.

*Jonas Pai,Liam Achenbach,Victoriano Montesinos,Benedek Forrai,Oier Mees,Elvis Nava*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) for robotic manipulation that leverages video pretraining for both semantics and physical dynamics, outperforming traditional vision-language-action models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLA models lack physical causality understanding, requiring excessive expert data collection due to reliance solely on robot trajectories. This paper strives to improve this inefficiency.

Method: The paper combines a pretrained video model for capturing semantics and dynamics with a flow matching-based action decoder acting as an Inverse Dynamics Model for generating robot actions.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves performance, with 10x better sample efficiency and 2x faster convergence speed in robotic manipulation tasks, both simulated and real-world.

Conclusion: The integration of video pretraining enhances physical understanding and semantic generalization in robotics, reducing the dependency on extensive expert data collection and advancing the efficacy of robotic manipulation systems.

Abstract: Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce \model, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.

*Jahidul Arafat*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines dependency amplification across ten software ecosystems, revealing significant divergence in amplification patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand software supply chain security implications stemming from dependency amplification across different ecosystems.

Method: Empirical analysis of 500 projects across ten major software ecosystems to quantify dependency amplification.

Result: Find Maven projects with high amplification (mean of 24.70 times), while others like Go Modules, npm, and CocoaPods exhibit lower patterns. Large differences traced to ecosystem design.

Conclusion: Ecosystem-specific security strategies should be adopted based on observed amplification patterns, such as auditing for Maven or targeted interventions for npm and RubyGems.

Abstract: Modern software development relies on package ecosystems where a single declared dependency can pull in many additional transitive packages. This dependency amplification, defined as the ratio of transitive to direct dependencies, has major implications for software supply chain security, yet amplification patterns across ecosystems have not been compared at scale. We present an empirical study of 500 projects across ten major ecosystems, including Maven Central for Java, npm Registry for JavaScript, crates io for Rust, PyPI for Python, NuGet Gallery for dot NET, RubyGems for Ruby, Go Modules for Go, Packagist for PHP, CocoaPods for Swift and Objective C, and Pub for Dart. Our analysis shows that Maven exhibits mean amplification of 24.70 times, compared to 4.48 times for Go Modules, 4.32 times for npm, and 0.32 times for CocoaPods. We find significant differences with large effect sizes in 22 of 45 pairwise comparisons, challenging the assumption that npm has the highest amplification due to its many small purpose packages. We observe that 28 percent of Maven projects exceed 10 times amplification, indicating a systematic pattern rather than isolated outliers, compared to 14 percent for RubyGems, 12 percent for npm, and zero percent for Cargo, PyPI, Packagist, CocoaPods, and Pub. We attribute these differences to ecosystem design choices such as dependency resolution behavior, standard library completeness, and platform constraints. Our findings suggest adopting ecosystem specific security strategies, including systematic auditing for Maven environments, targeted outlier detection for npm and RubyGems, and continuation of current practices for ecosystems with controlled amplification. We provide a full replication package with data and analysis scripts.

### [271] [A High-level Synthesis Toolchain for the Julia Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15679)
*Benedict Short,Ian McInerney,John Wickerson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an MLIR-based compiler toolchain that automates FPGA kernel compilation from Julia to SystemVerilog, offering competitive performance and fully vendor-agnostic RTL generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in computational demands with Exascale computing and data-driven methods necessitates efficient problem-specific accelerators, but current development workflows face challenges due to the "two-language problem."

Method: The paper proposes an MLIR-based compiler toolchain that translates Julia code directly into SystemVerilog, enabling domain experts to retarget compute kernels to FPGA without additional customization.

Result: The prototype toolchain synthesizes benchmarks operating at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving 59.71% to 82.6% throughput compared to state-of-the-art low-level language compilers.

Conclusion: This toolchain simplifies FPGA development for domain experts by removing the two-language barrier and offers competitive performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: With the push towards Exascale computing and data-driven methods, problem sizes have increased dramatically, increasing the computational requirements of the underlying algorithms. This has led to a push to offload computations to general purpose hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs, and a renewed interest in designing problem-specific accelerators using FPGAs. However, the development process of these problem-specific accelerators currently suffers from the "two-language problem": algorithms are developed in one (usually higher-level) language, but the kernels are implemented in another language at a completely different level of abstraction and requiring fundamentally different expertise. To address this problem, we propose a new MLIR-based compiler toolchain that unifies the development process by automatically compiling kernels written in the Julia programming language into SystemVerilog without the need for any additional directives or language customisations. Our toolchain supports both dynamic and static scheduling, directly integrates with the AXI4-Stream protocol to interface with subsystems like on- and off-chip memory, and generates vendor-agnostic RTL. This prototype toolchain is able to synthesize a set of signal processing/mathematical benchmarks that can operate at 100MHz on real FPGA devices, achieving between 59.71% and 82.6% of the throughput of designs generated by state-of-the-art toolchains that only compile from low-level languages like C or C++. Overall, this toolchain allows domain experts to write compute kernels in Julia as they normally would, and then retarget them to an FPGA without additional pragmas or modifications.

Method: The authors developed the Value Driver Modelling Notation (VDMN), which includes semantic constructs and graphical syntax, and evaluated it through two case studies and expert interviews.

Result: The results show that the VDMN supports consistent and comprehensible modelling of VDTs, as confirmed by its practical application and expert feedback.

Conclusion: VDMN is a significant step toward systematising and standardising the modelling of Value Driver Trees, improving their clarity and utility in a business context.

Abstract: Value Driver Trees (VDTs) are conceptual models used to illustrate and analyse the causal relationships between key performance indicators and business outcomes, thereby supporting managerial decision-making and value-based management. Despite their increasing application, there are still no systematic guidelines for the modelling of such conceptual models. To fill this gap, this study introduces the Value Driver Modelling Notation (VDMN), a graphical notation developed to systematically guide VDT modelling. This notation includes a comprehensive set of semantic constructs and an intuitive graphical syntax. To evaluate its practical utility, the VDMN was applied in two case studies and assessed through expert interviews. The results show that the notation supports a consistent and comprehensible modelling of VDTs. The VDMN thus represents a significant step towards the systematisation and standardisation of VDT modelling.

### [273] [Revisiting the Reliability of Language Models in Instruction-Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14754)
*Jianshuo Dong,Yutong Zhang,Yan Liu,Zhenyu Zhong,Tao Wei,Chao Zhang,Han Qiu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper studies nuance-oriented reliability in advanced LLMs, proposing a metric (reliable@k) and IFEval++ to investigate drops in performance when prompts vary subtly. The findings emphasize building more dependable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between high benchmark instruction-following accuracy and real-world reliability where prompts are nuanced or varied.

Method: Introduced reliable@k metric and IFEval++; applied automated data augmentation to generate nuanced prompts and evaluated 46 LLMs.

Result: Substantial performance drops of up to 61.8% were found across proprietary and open-source LLMs when evaluated with nuanced prompts.

Conclusion: Nuance-oriented reliability is critical for future trustworthy LLM development, especially in varied real-world applications.

Abstract: Advanced LLMs have achieved near-ceiling instruction-following accuracy on benchmarks such as IFEval. However, these impressive scores do not necessarily translate to reliable services in real-world use, where users often vary their phrasing, contextual framing, and task formulations. In this paper, we study nuance-oriented reliability: whether models exhibit consistent competence across cousin prompts that convey analogous user intents but with subtle nuances. To quantify this, we introduce a new metric, reliable@k, and develop an automated pipeline that generates high-quality cousin prompts via data augmentation. Building upon this, we construct IFEval++ for systematic evaluation. Across 20 proprietary and 26 open-source LLMs, we find that current models exhibit substantial insufficiency in nuance-oriented reliability -- their performance can drop by up to 61.8% with nuanced prompt modifications. What's more, we characterize it and explore three potential improvement recipes. Our findings highlight nuance-oriented reliability as a crucial yet underexplored next step toward more dependable and trustworthy LLM behavior.

### [274] [Examining Software Developers' Needs for Privacy Enforcing Techniques: A survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14756)
*Ioanna Theophilou,Georgia M. Kapitsaki*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates developer needs in complying with data privacy laws, identifying a demand for automated tools and privacy facilitators, based on a survey of 68 developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and assist developers in integrating legal privacy requirements into software seamlessly, especially in light of prevailing privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA/CPRA.

Method: The study conducted a survey with 68 developers to analyze their needs and factors influencing how they address privacy law compliance.

Result: The survey revealed that developers desire automated tools to simplify compliance processes and that practitioners with privacy experience show heightened concerns for tools addressing privacy.

Conclusion: There is a critical need for development automation tools and facilitators to support developers in integrating data privacy compliance within their software systems.

Abstract: Data privacy legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA/CPRA, has rendered data privacy law compliance a requirement of all software systems. Developers need to implement various kinds of functionalities to cover law needs, including user rights and law principles. As data compliance is tightly coupled with legal knowledge, it is not always easy to perform such integrations in software systems. Prior studies have focused on developers' understanding of privacy principles, such as Privacy by Design, and have examined privacy techniques used in the software industry. Nevertheless, emerging developer needs that can assist in privacy law compliance have not been examined but are useful in understanding what development automation tools, such as Generative AI, need to cover to make the compliance process more straightforward and seamless within the development process. In this work, we present a survey that examines the above needs with the participation of 68 developers, while we have examined which factors affect practitioners' needs. Most developers express a need for more automated tools, while privacy experience increases practitioners' concerns for privacy tools. Our results can assist practitioners in better positioning their development activities within privacy law compliance and point to an urgent need for privacy facilitators.

### [275] [CAPE: Capability Achievement via Policy Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14761)
*David Ball*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AI systems struggle to express and enforce requirements despite intelligence and optimization post-training. The CAPE protocol provides a systematic approach to translate requirements into executable specifications and trains models to meet them reliably, showing significantly reduced model violation rates and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI models are intelligent but often fail to meet explicit, context-dependent constraints in real-world applications due to the lack of a systematic mechanism to enforce these requirements.

Method: The authors introduce Capability Engineering and CAPE protocol, which follows a cycle of Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train, relying on contextual objectivity and verification-fidelity scaling as empirical bases.

Result: CAPE reduces model violation rates by 81%, minimizes annotation costs by up to 20 times, and accelerates implementation timelines from months to weeks. They also present tools, such as a specification language and a registry for model evaluations.

Conclusion: CAPE enables AI systems to reliably satisfy explicit requirements by default, offering a practical path to improving capability measurement and reducing deployment failures.

Abstract: Modern AI systems lack a way to express and enforce requirements. Pre-training produces intelligence, and post-training optimizes preferences, but neither guarantees that models reliably satisfy explicit, context-dependent constraints. This missing abstraction explains why highly intelligent models routinely fail in deployment despite strong benchmark performance.
  We introduce Capability Engineering, the systematic practice of converting requirements into executable specifications and training models to satisfy them by default. We operationalize this practice through CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Execution), a protocol implementing a Specify -> Verify -> Correct -> Train loop.
  CAPE is grounded in two empirical findings: (1) contextual objectivity, where properties appearing subjective become objective once context is fixed (inter-annotator agreement rises from kappa = 0.42 to kappa = 0.98), and (2) verification-fidelity scaling, where verification accuracy improves with model scale (r = 0.94), unlike preference agreement which plateaus at 30 to 50 percent disagreement regardless of compute. Across 109,500 examples in six domains, CAPE reduces violation rates by 81 percent relative to DPO (standard deviation less than 0.3 percent). By replacing per-example annotation with reusable specifications, CAPE reduces costs by 5 to 20 times and shortens timelines from months to weeks.
  We release the CAPE protocol, PredicateGraph schema, CPL specification language, and policy packs under Apache 2.0. We also launch CapabilityBench, a public registry of model evaluations against community-contributed policies, shifting evaluation from intelligence benchmarks toward capability measurement.

### [276] [Workflows vs Agents for Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14762)
*Henry Gray,Tom Yotam,Octavian Udrea*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates two LLM-powered syntax repair methods in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline, finding an agentic approach significantly improves error resolution and simulation success rates, particularly for small and mid-sized LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing processes to automate MATLAB-to-HDL translation is critical for efficient FPGA/ASIC deployment. However, syntax errors due to LLMs' limited HDL training hinder automation, requiring methods to improve resilience.

Method: The authors compare a structured, fixed-sequence repair flow and a dynamic agentic approach with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for syntax error correction during MATLAB-to-HDL transpilation, studying effects on pipeline stages and syntax outcomes.

Result: The agentic approach demonstrates superior syntax error resolution and pipeline unblocking, significantly improving success rates in simulations, especially for mid-sized models. Gains are attributed to context management and conditional tool use.

Conclusion: Agentic frameworks enhance syntax repair for small/mid-sized LLMs by effectively compensating for capacity limitations. Proper design and tool selection play a critical role in optimizing LLM-driven translation pipelines.

Abstract: Translating algorithms from high-level languages like MATLAB to hardware description languages (HDLs) is a resource-intensive but necessary step for deployment on FPGAs and ASICs. While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), demonstrating through case studies how ADRS can outperform human designs in optimizing system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is leveraging AI to drive systems research by automating iterative solution cycles and validating solutions through reliable verifiers in the context of system performance problems.

Method: The authors present the ADRS paradigm, evaluate it using open-source frameworks (OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), and conduct ten case studies presented as examples.

Result: The ADRS-generated solutions were shown to meet or exceed human state-of-the-art designs, with detailed evaluations revealing best practices for ADRS adoption.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes ADRS's potential to transform systems research, provides actionable insights, and underlines future pathways for broader ADRS applications.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform the research process by automating the discovery of new solutions. This shift depends on the availability of reliable verifiers, which AI-driven approaches require to validate candidate solutions. Research focused on improving systems performance is especially well-suited to this paradigm because system performance problems naturally admit such verifiers: candidates can be implemented in real systems or simulators and evaluated against predefined workloads. We term this iterative cycle of generation, evaluation, and refinement AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS). Using several open-source ADRS instances (i.e., OpenEvolve, GEPA, and ShinkaEvolve), we demonstrate across ten case studies (e.g., multi-region cloud scheduling, mixture-of-experts load balancing, LLM-based SQL, transaction scheduling) that ADRS-generated solutions can match or even outperform human state-of-the-art designs. Based on these findings, we outline best practices (e.g., level of prompt specification, amount of feedback, robust evaluation) for effectively using ADRS, and we discuss future research directions and their implications. Although we do not yet have a universal recipe for applying ADRS across all of systems research, we hope our preliminary findings, together with the challenges we identify, offer meaningful guidance for future work as researcher effort shifts increasingly toward problem formulation and strategic oversight. Note: This paper is an extension of our prior work [14]. It adds extensive evaluation across multiple ADRS frameworks and provides deeper analysis and insights into best practices.

*Changshu Liu,Alireza Ghazanfari,Yang Chen,Reyhaneh Jabbarvand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces RE2-Bench, a more realistic benchmark for code reasoning in large language models (LLMs), by incorporating real-world complexities missing from previous benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs on real-world code reasoning complexities, which simpler benchmarks fail to capture, potentially overestimating their effectiveness.

Method: The authors developed RE2-Bench, a benchmark with 1,101 reasoning tasks, leveraging program analysis to represent realistic complexities and categorize tasks by difficulty through interpretable metrics.

Result: Evaluation of six LLMs demonstrated significant performance drops from Easy to Hard problems, revealing limitations in their reasoning capabilities when exposed to realistic challenges.

Conclusion: Current LLM benchmarks lack realism, and RE2-Bench enables more accurate assessments, highlighting the need for continued improvement in LLM reasoning evaluations.

Abstract: Code reasoning tasks are becoming prevalent in large language model (LLM) assessments. Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work.
  A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\% for input prediction and 42.15\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

### [280] [Imitation Game: Reproducing Deep Learning Bugs Leveraging an Intelligent Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14990)
*Mehil B Shah,Mohammad Masudur Rahman,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Deep learning applications are prone to bugs, which are difficult to reproduce manually due to model nondeterminism and environment complexities. The paper introduces RepGen, an automated mechanism to reproduce deep learning bugs using a learning-enhanced context and an iterative generation process, achieving significant improvement over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based systems frequently encounter bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities, and reproducing these bugs is crucial for resolution yet highly challenging given the complexity of DL models and environment dependencies.

Method: RepGen employs a learning-enhanced context approach integrating project-specific information, devises detailed plans for bug reproduction, and utilizes an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism powered by large language models (LLMs) to generate code capable of reproducing DL bugs.

Result: RepGen achieves an 80.19% reproduction rate of DL bugs, showing a 19.81% improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, a developer study demonstrated enhanced success rates in bug reproduction, significantly reduced time, and lower cognitive effort for participants.

Conclusion: The automated mechanism RepGen drastically improves the reproducibility of deep learning bugs, thereby aiding bug resolution efforts with higher efficiency and reduced developer workload.

Abstract: Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.

*Mia Mohammad Imran,Robert Zita,Rahat Rizvi Rahman,Preetha Chatterjee,Kostadin Damevski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This work addresses toxicity in Open Source Software (OSS) communities by developing a dataset and proposing an LLM-based framework to predict toxic conversations, with superior performance over existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to understand and mitigate toxic interactions in OSS communities, as such toxicity impacts contributor engagement and project sustainability. Existing manual moderation approaches are labor-intensive, driving the need for scalable, automated solutions.

Method: The study curated a dataset of 366 GitHub discussion threads (159 toxic and 207 non-toxic). It introduced a two-step LLM-based evaluation pipeline using Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting to first summarize conversation dynamics and then estimate derailment likelihood.

Result: The proposed LtM-based framework achieved high predictive accuracy, with F1-scores of 0.901 (Qwen) and 0.852 (Llama) at a threshold of 0.3. It outperformed established NLP baselines for conversation derailment prediction.

Conclusion: Structured LLM prompting effectively detects early signs of conversational derailment, supporting proactive, explainable moderation in OSS communities and offering a scalable alternative to manual approaches.

Abstract: Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.
  We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BODE-GEN, a Bayesian optimization approach for generating accurate code by adapting prompts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving functional correctness of code generated by LLMs by optimizing prompt formulation.

Method: BODE-GEN utilizes Bayesian optimization in continuous embedding spaces with Gaussian processes, leveraging random projections and dimensionality scaled priors to adapt prompts iteratively and efficiently.

Result: Experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark show BODE-GEN significantly improves code generation accuracy compared to fixed or manually engineered prompts, while requiring fewer optimization iterations.

Conclusion: BODE-GEN offers an effective, data-driven solution for improving LLM-based code generation, demonstrating both accuracy improvement and sample-efficiency.

Abstract: We consider the task of generating functionally correct code using large language models (LLMs). The correctness of generated code is influenced by the prompt used to query the given base LLM. We formulate the problem of finding the appropriate prompt as combinatorial search process and propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach referred to as {\em BO for Code GENeration (BODE-GEN)}. BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space. We leverage two synergistic ideas, namely, random projections and dimensionality scaled priors, to build effective Gaussian process based surrogate models over the high-dimensional embedding space. Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the gap between academic advances in software engineering, especially driven by large language models, and their relevance to real-world industrial needs.

Method: Systematic analysis of 1,367 academic SE papers published between 2022 and 2025, combined with an empirical survey across 17 organizations involving 282 responses on six key SE topics.

Result: Identified critical gaps between academic research capabilities and industry feedback on SE, such as challenges in software requirements, reliability, ethical considerations, and evaluation assumptions.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need to redirect academic SE research toward industrially impactful areas to address under-explored problems and bridge the academic-industry gap.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally reshaping software engineering (SE), driving a paradigm shift in both academic research and industrial practice. While top-tier SE venues continue to show sustained or emerging focus on areas like automated testing and program repair, with researchers worldwide reporting continuous performance gains, the alignment of these academic advances with real industrial needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 1,367 papers published in FSE, ASE, and ICSE between 2022 and 2025, identifying key research topics, commonly used benchmarks, industrial relevance, and open-source availability. We then carry out an empirical survey across 17 organizations, collecting 282 responses on six prominent topics, i.e., program analysis, automated testing, code generation/completion, issue resolution, pre-trained code models, and dependency management, through structured questionnaires. By contrasting academic capabilities with industrial feedback, we derive seven critical implications, highlighting under-addressed challenges in software requirements and architecture, the reliability and explainability of intelligent SE approaches, input assumptions in academic research, practical evaluation tensions, and ethical considerations. This study aims to refocus academic attention on these important yet under-explored problems and to guide future SE research toward greater industrial impact.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BDTransTest, a tool to verify BPMN+DMN processes, addressing both syntactical and semantic faults through automated testing and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers of BPMN+DMN business processes currently struggle with detecting semantic errors using existing tools, requiring manual testing and encountering unspecified simulations in proprietary tools.

Method: BDTransTest translates BPMN+DMN processes into Java programs, synthesizes testing plans (with input domain disambiguation if necessary), and evaluates coverage based on nodes and edges.

Result: The experimental evaluation showcases the effectiveness of BDTransTest in handling BPMN+DMN processes from the literature.

Conclusion: BDTransTest enhances the verification of BPMN+DMN business processes by addressing their semantic faults and automating testing, providing a substantial improvement over existing frameworks.

Abstract: The increasing and widespread use of BPMN business processes, also embodying DMN tables, requires tools and methodologies to verify their correctness. However, most commonly used frameworks to build BPMN+DMN models only allow designers to detect syntactical errors, thus ignoring semantic (behavioural) faults. This forces business processes designers to manually run single executions of their BPMN+DMN processes using proprietary tools in order to detect failures. Furthermore, how proprietary tools translate a BPMN+DMN process to a computer simulation is left unspecified. In this paper, we advance this state of the art by designing a tool, named BDTransTest providing: i) a translation from a BPMN + DMN process B to a Java program P ; ii) the synthesis and execution of a testing plan for B, that may require the business designer to disambiguate some input domain; iii) the analysis of the coverage achieved by the testing plan in terms of nodes and edges of B. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our methodology on BPMN+DMN processes from the literature.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes an approach for aligning models in multi-layered digital twins to address semantic and synchronization challenges, featuring automated processes using adaptive mechanisms and large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve the challenges of semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues in aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers in multi-layered digital twins.

Method: The proposed method uses a framework with adaptive conformance mechanisms and large language model (LLM) validated alignment to automate semantic alignment, minimize manual intervention, and maintain consistency between metamodels and models.

Result: The approach was demonstrated with an air quality case study and validated with test cases from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), showing scalability and improved semantic coherence.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the ability to integrate and align heterogeneous models in digital twins, improving scalability and semantic consistency while reducing manual effort.

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology integrates heterogeneous data and models, along with semantic technologies to create multi-layered digital representation of physical systems. DTs enable monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization to enhance decision making and operational efficiency. A key challenge in multi-layered, model-driven DTs is aligning heterogeneous models across abstraction layers, which can lead to semantic mismatches, inconsistencies, and synchronization issues. Existing methods, relying on static mappings and manual updates, are often inflexible, error-prone, and risk compromising data integrity. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous model alignment approach for multi-layered, model-driven DTs. The framework incorporates a flexibility mechanism that allows metamodels to adapt and interconnect seamlessly while maintaining semantic coherence across abstraction layers. It integrates: (i) adaptive conformance mechanisms that link metamodels with evolving models and (ii) a large language model (LLM) validated alignment process that grounds metamodels in domain knowledge, ensuring structural fidelity and conceptual consistency throughout the DT lifecycle. This approach automates semantic correspondences discovery, minimizes manual mapping, and enhances scalability across diverse model types. We illustrate the approach using air quality use case and validate its performance using different test cases from Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) remains a critical challenge, as traditional verification methods such as large-scale on-road testing are prohibitively costly and time-consuming.To address this,scenario-based testing has emerged as a scalable and efficient alternative,yet existing surveys provide only partial coverage of recent methodological and technological advances.This review systematically analyzes 31 primary studies,and 10 surveys identified through a comprehensive search spanning 2015~2025;however,the in-depth methodological synthesis and comparative evaluation focus primarily on recent frameworks(2023~2025),reflecting the surge of Artificial Intelligent(AI)-assisted and multimodal approaches in this period.Traditional approaches rely on expert knowledge,ontologies,and naturalistic driving or accident data,while recent developments leverage generative models,including large language models,generative adversarial networks,diffusion models,and reinforcement learning frameworks,to synthesize diverse and safety-critical scenarios.Our synthesis identifies three persistent gaps:the absence of standardized evaluation metrics,limited integration of ethical and human factors,and insufficient coverage of multimodal and Operational Design Domain (ODD)-specific scenarios.To address these challenges,this review contributes a refined taxonomy that incorporates multimodal extensions,an ethical and safety checklist for responsible scenario design,and an ODD coverage map with a scenario-difficulty schema to enable transparent benchmarking.Collectively,these contributions provide methodological clarity for researchers and practical guidance for industry,supporting reproducible evaluation and accelerating the safe deployment of higher-level ADS.

### [287] [Insecure Ingredients? Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15447)
*Ben Swierzy,Marc Ohm,Michael Meier*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Aletheia, a method to detect JavaScript package versions from bundles to improve understanding of dependency updates, showing its practical advantages and presenting a security and update behavior analysis of dependencies in the top 100,000 domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address the security issue of popular yet vulnerable JavaScript package versions on production websites and improve the scalability of dependency analysis approaches to understand update behaviors comprehensively.

Method: Aletheia is proposed as a package-agnostic tool that uses algorithms from plagiarism detection to extract JavaScript package versions from bundles, overcoming the limitations of prior methods focused on specific package types or single-file resources.

Result: The Aletheia method outperforms existing detection methods in practical usage. Analysis of the Tranco top 100,000 domains reveals 5%-20% update dependencies within 16 weeks, with bundled packages updated faster than CDN-included ones and having fewer known vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: Aletheia enables scalable and effective analysis of JavaScript dependencies. Despite faster updates of bundled packages, a few major vendors seem to drive these updates, suggesting that update rates may not fully reflect a broader improvement in security practices.

Abstract: Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.

*Carsten Ellwein,Jingxi Zhang,Andreas Wortmann,Antony Ayman Alfy Meckhael*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new architecture enabling digital twins, realized as Asset Administration Shells (AAS), to integrate dynamic, containerized services for proactive functionalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AAS approaches are limited as static information models, lacking support for system adaptation and executable behaviors within industrial environments.

Method: The researchers propose extending the AAS framework with a submodel-based architecture, embedding behavioral definitions to dynamically deploy and trigger containerized services.

Result: The proposal is validated through a case study with a 3-axis milling machine, demonstrating the dynamic adaptation and service execution enabled by the integrated approach.

Conclusion: This advancement transforms the AAS from a passive data repository into an active, event-driven interface capable of executing high-value services, paving the way for more adaptive and intelligent digital twin systems.

Abstract: In manufacturing, digital twins, realized as Asset Administration Shells (AAS), have emerged as a prevalent practice. These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.

### [289] [On Assessing the Relevance of Code Reviews Authored by Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15466)
*Robert Heumüller,Frank Ortmeier*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates ChatGPT's capability in code review using a unique multi-subjective ranking approach, revealing that ChatGPT-generated comments often surpass human reviews in quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation techniques for code review generation have limitations: relying on a single ground truth does not represent diverse perspectives, while subjective 'usefulness' lacks clear definition.

Method: A multi-subjective ranking methodology was introduced, using human judges to compare ChatGPT's comments against the top responses from CodeReview StackExchange in a dataset of 280 cases.

Result: ChatGPT's generated comments were ranked superior to human responses, including those marked as accepted answers on the platform.

Conclusion: The study highlights ChatGPT's potential in outperforming human code reviews and introduces a better evaluation method for generative AI, with a caution on risks of unchecked adoption.

Abstract: The use of large language models like ChatGPT in code review offers promising efficiency gains but also raises concerns about correctness and safety. Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.

*Hua Yang,Alejandro Velasco,Thanh Le-Cong,Md Nazmul Haque,Bowen Xu,Denys Poshyvanyk*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Transforming code with semantic equivalents can compromise Membership Inference (MI) detection used to ensure license compliance, by reducing its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unauthorized use of license-restricted code in large language model training while ensuring proper intellectual property compliance.

Method: Systematic investigation of semantically equivalent code transformation rules and their impact on Membership Inference (MI) detection.

Result: Model accuracy is minimally affected by transformations (only 1.5% drop); one transformation (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%. Combining transformations does not further weaken MI effectiveness.

Conclusion: Transformation-based obfuscation techniques reveal limitations in MI detection, raising concerns for intellectual property compliance in training large language models for code.

Abstract: The success of large language models for code relies on vast amounts of code data, including public open-source repositories, such as GitHub, and private, confidential code from companies. This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic.
  In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.

*Thomas Rooijakkers,Anne Nijsten,Cristian Daniele,Erieke Weitenberg,Ringo Groenewegen,Arthur Melissen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces WuppieFuzz, a REST API fuzzer built on LibAFL, that uses OpenAPI specifications and mutators to test web service endpoints effectively for security vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thorough testing of REST APIs is vital to reduce security risks associated with exposed endpoints in web services. Given the multitude of endpoints, automated testing methods like fuzzing are necessary.

Method: The authors developed WuppieFuzz, which generates an input corpus from OpenAPI specifications and uses tailored mutators for white-box, grey-box, and black-box fuzzing. It automates harness creation, measures coverage, and selects request sequences strategically to comprehensively test software under different states.

Result: The tool was evaluated on the Petstore API, demonstrating the effectiveness of white-box approaches, different power schedules, and endpoint/code coverage monitoring.

Conclusion: WuppieFuzz effectively reduces manual effort in fuzzing and enables efficient exploration of software vulnerabilities in REST APIs, providing actionable insights for improving robustness.

Abstract: Many business processes currently depend on web services, often using REST APIs for communication. REST APIs expose web service functionality through endpoints, allowing easy client interaction over the Internet. To reduce the security risk resulting from exposed endpoints, thorough testing is desired. Due to the generally vast number of endpoints, automated testing techniques, like fuzzing, are of interest.
  This paper introduces WuppieFuzz, an open-source REST API fuzzer built on LibAFL, supporting white-box, grey-box and black-box fuzzing. Using an OpenAPI specification, it can generate an initial input corpus consisting of sequences of requests. These are mutated with REST-specific and LibAFL-provided mutators to explore different code paths in the software under test. Guided by the measured coverage, WuppieFuzz then selects which request sequences to send next to reach complex states in the software under test. In this process, it automates harness creation to reduce manual efforts often required in fuzzing. Different kinds of reporting are provided by the fuzzer to help fixing bugs.
  We evaluated our tool on the Petstore API to assess the robustness of the white-box approach and the effectiveness of different power schedules. We further monitored endpoint and code coverage over time to measure the efficacy of the approach.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study investigates the influence of stress and negative affect on hallucinations, finding that these factors increase conditioned hallucinations (CH) rates and sensory priors, particularly in psychosis patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how stress and negative affect contribute to hallucinations, particularly in early psychosis, and validate a method to assess these effects using the CH task.

Method: The modified CH task was applied using linguistic stimuli under stress and non-stress conditions on a pilot sample of individuals at risk of psychosis, first-episode psychosis patients (N=12), and healthy controls (N=15).

Result: Patients showed higher CH rates and prior weighting than controls, aligning with prior studies. Stress manipulations led to increased prior weighting across both patients and controls.

Conclusion: The study validates the affective CH task and suggests affective states influence sensory priors in psychosis. This could help in developing biomarkers for early psychosis detection.

Abstract: Background: Stress and negative affect play significant roles in developing psychosis. Bayesian analyses applied to the conditioned hallucinations (CH) task suggest that hallucinations arise when maladaptive prior beliefs outweigh sensory evidence. Prior weighting is linked to hallucination severity, yet the nature of these priors remains unclear. Negative affect may influence the strength of maladaptive priors. We hypothesized that, under stress, participants will show increased CH rates and prior weighting, with this effect more pronounced in patients.
  Methods: This study employs a modified CH task using valenced linguistic stimuli and stress and non-stress affective manipulations. The sample for this pilot study included those at risk for psychosis and patients with first episode psychosis (N=12) and healthy controls (N=15). The objective of this study was first to validate this affective version of the CH task and then to demonstrate an effect of affect on CH rates and prior weighting.
  Results: Replicating past results, patients had higher CH rates (b = 0.061, p < 0.001) and prior weighting (b = 0.097, p < 0.001) for session 1 compared to controls (n=15) across conditions. Further, runs with stress manipulations had higher prior weighting across patients and controls compared to runs with non-stress manipulations (b = 0.054, p = 0.033).
  Conclusions: This study validates this affective version of the CH task and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between affective state and prior weighting. Future work will be aimed at confirming and extending these findings, with the objective of developing biomarkers of early psychosis.

### [293] [When sufficiency is insufficient: the functional information bottleneck for identifying probabilistic neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15671)
*Ishan Kalburge,Máté Lengyel*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework, functional information bottleneck (fIB), to evaluate neural representations for probabilistic computations, finding that task-optimized networks analyzed fail to develop true probabilistic codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of clear criteria for distinguishing probabilistic representations from heuristic neural codes in task-optimized neural networks.

Method: The authors developed the functional information bottleneck (fIB) framework, which assesses neural representations based on both statistical sufficiency and minimality, and applied this framework to analyze various task-optimized neural networks.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that previously suggested probabilistic representations in neural networks fail to meet the minimality criterion and rely on heuristic input recoding instead of true probabilistic coding.

Conclusion: The study introduces a rigorous tool to examine neural representations, showing that probabilistic coding does not naturally emerge in the analyzed networks. It highlights the need for further investigation into conditions for developing true probabilistic representations.

Abstract: The neural basis of probabilistic computations remains elusive, even amidst growing evidence that humans and other animals track their uncertainty. Recent work has proposed that probabilistic representations arise naturally in task-optimized neural networks trained without explicitly probabilistic inductive biases. However, prior work has lacked clear criteria for distinguishing probabilistic representations, those that perform transformations characteristic of probabilistic computation, from heuristic neural codes that merely reformat inputs. We propose a novel information bottleneck framework, the functional information bottleneck (fIB), that crucially evaluates a neural representation based not only on its statistical sufficiency but also on its minimality, allowing us to disambiguate heuristic from probabilistic coding. To demonstrate the power of this framework, we study a variety of task-optimized neural networks that had been suggested to develop probabilistic representations in earlier work: networks trained to perform static inference tasks (such as cue combination and coordinate transformation) or dynamic state estimation tasks (Kalman filtering). In contrast to earlier claims, our minimality requirement reveals that probabilistic representations fail to emerge in these networks: they do not develop minimal codes of Bayesian posteriors in their hidden layer activities, and instead rely on heuristic input recoding. Therefore, it remains an open question under which conditions truly probabilistic representations emerge in neural networks. More generally, our work provides a stringent framework for identifying probabilistic neural codes. Thus, it lays the foundation for systematically examining whether, how, and which posteriors are represented in neural circuits during complex decision-making tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and applicability of the PaLD algorithm for online applications like semi-supervised learning and anomaly detection.

Method: The authors develop 'online PaLD,' which precomputes a cohesion network of a reference dataset in $O(n^3)$ time, enabling extension to new data points in $O(n^2)$ time.

Result: The algorithm accelerates the application of the PaLD algorithm in online contexts without compromising accuracy, illustrated via healthcare datasets.

Conclusion: Online PaLD effectively complements existing speed-up techniques and demonstrates practical utility in semi-supervised classification and anomaly detection.

Abstract: We introduce an extension of the partitioned local depth (PaLD) algorithm that is adapted to online applications such as semi-supervised prediction. The new algorithm we present, online PaLD, is well-suited to situations where it is a possible to pre-compute a cohesion network from a reference dataset. After $O(n^3)$ steps to construct a queryable data structure, online PaLD can extend the cohesion network to a new data point in $O(n^2)$ time. Our approach complements previous speed up approaches based on approximation and parallelism. For illustrations, we present applications to online anomaly detection and semi-supervised classification for health-care datasets.

TL;DR: The paper studies the Hessian matrix's eigenspectrum in neural networks, linking it to learning performance, and presents insights for both linear and nonlinear settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the relationship between the Hessian matrix's properties (e.g., eigenspectrum) and the learning dynamics/performance of neural networks during gradient descent.

Method: The authors analyze the Hessian's eigenspectrum using analytical techniques for linear networks and numerical methods for nonlinear networks, considering specific activation functions and teacher-student setups.

Result: For linear networks, the Hessian's spectrum follows a convolution of certain distributions, while for nonlinear networks, insights are provided about the Hessian's rank and its link to effective parameters.

Conclusion: The Hessian spectrum provides critical insights into learning dynamics, and particular eigenvalues and the matrix's rank can influence long-term performance. The study also differentiates behaviors between linear and nonlinear networks.

Abstract: Near an optimal learning point of a neural network, the learning performance of gradient descent dynamics is dictated by the Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. We characterize the Hessian eigenspectrum for some classes of teacher-student problems, when the teacher and student networks have matching weights, showing that the smaller eigenvalues of the Hessian determine long-time learning performance. For linear networks, we analytically establish that for large networks the spectrum asymptotically follows a convolution of a scaled chi-square distribution with a scaled Marchenko-Pastur distribution. We numerically analyse the Hessian spectrum for polynomial and other non-linear networks. Furthermore, we show that the rank of the Hessian matrix can be seen as an effective number of parameters for networks using polynomial activation functions. For a generic non-linear activation function, such as the error function, we empirically observe that the Hessian matrix is always full rank.

TL;DR: The paper provides a high-dimensional theoretical analysis of Partial Least Squares (PLS), particularly its PLS-SVD variant, exploring its behavior and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap of limited theoretical understanding of PLS behavior in high-dimensional data integration, especially to understand its effectiveness in extracting shared latent structures.

Method: The study uses random matrix theory to analyze the singular vectors of the cross-covariance matrix and derive asymptotic characterizations of alignment between estimated and true latent directions in high-dimensional data.

Result: The authors provide asymptotic explanations for PLS-SVD’s reconstruction performance, identify its counter-intuitive behaviors, and assert its superiority over PCA in certain scenarios for detecting common latent subspaces.

Conclusion: The paper enhances a theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, highlighting its advantages in shared structure detection while also pointing out limitations.

Abstract: Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-rank common latent structure while also containing individual-specific components. We analyze the singular vectors of the associated cross-covariance matrix using tools from random matrix theory and derive asymptotic characterizations of the alignment between estimated and true latent directions. These results provide a quantitative explanation of the reconstruction performance of the PLS variant based on Singular Value Decomposition (PLS-SVD) and identify regimes where the method exhibits counter-intuitive or limiting behavior. Building on this analysis, we compare PLS-SVD with principal component analysis applied separately to each dataset and show its asymptotic superiority in detecting the common latent subspace. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive theoretical understanding of high-dimensional PLS-SVD, clarifying both its advantages and fundamental limitations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores how conversational style impacts youth's perception of AI chatbots, focusing on relational versus transparent styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how conversational AI's style affects emotional reliance and anthropomorphism among adolescents, especially those who are socially and emotionally vulnerable.

Method: Experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads to compare chatbot responses in relational versus transparent conversational styles.

Result: Adolescents preferred relational chatbot style more than parents did, associating it with increased human-like qualities, emotional closeness, and trust. Vulnerable youth were especially drawn to relational style.

Conclusion: Relational conversational style can heighten anthropomorphism and emotional reliance in vulnerable adolescents, emphasizing its implications for AI safety in youth applications.

Abstract: General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a human-AI system called LAIZA to handle ambiguity in uncertain environments using a novel quantum-inspired method, demonstrated through a case study of intellectual property management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in how human-AI systems can manage ambiguity in uncertain conditions effectively, as most current AI systems are optimized for resolution rather than interpretive flexibility.

Method: The researchers present a proof of concept for the LAIZA system, incorporating processes like Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), human-in-the-loop decoherence, and collective cognitive inference, which were tested through a three-month case study.

Result: The findings reveal that preserving interpretive flexibility led to proactive measures like patent protection, facilitating decisive actions once ambiguity became clearer.

Conclusion: The paper highlights how the LAIZA system contributes to better ambiguity management, reframing it as a key concept in management theory and showcasing the value of human-AI collaboration for resilience in complex, uncertain environments.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly operate in environments characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), where early indicators of change often emerge as weak, fragmented signals. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used to support managerial decision-making, most AI-based systems remain optimized for prediction and resolution, leading to premature interpretive closure under conditions of high ambiguity. This creates a gap in management science regarding how human-AI systems can responsibly manage ambiguity before it crystallizes into error or crisis. This study addresses this gap by presenting a proof of concept (PoC) of the LAIZA human-AI augmented symbiotic intelligence system and its patented process: Systems and Methods for Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), Human-in-the-Loop Decoherence, and Collective Cognitive Inference. The mechanism operationalizes ambiguity as a non-collapsed cognitive state, detects persistent interpretive breakdowns (rogue variables), and activates structured human-in-the-loop clarification when autonomous inference becomes unreliable. Empirically, the article draws on a three-month case study conducted in 2025 within the AI development, involving prolonged ambiguity surrounding employee intentions and intellectual property boundaries. The findings show that preserving interpretive plurality enabled early scenario-based preparation, including proactive patent protection, allowing decisive and disruption-free action once ambiguity collapsed. The study contributes to management theory by reframing ambiguity as a first-class construct and demonstrates the practical value of human-AI symbiosis for organizational resilience in VUCA environments.

TL;DR: This paper studies user acceptance and concerns about LLM-powered conversational agents in extended reality (XR) settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address privacy and trust issues arising from the integration of generative AI in XR technologies.

Method: A crowdsourcing study was conducted with 1036 participants to analyze decision-making regarding the use of conversational agents under different XR settings.

Result: Users generally accept these technologies but have concerns primarily about security, privacy, and social implications. Familiarity with generative AI increases acceptance, whereas prior XR device ownership decreases it. Men exhibit higher acceptance with fewer concerns compared to women.

Conclusion: Effective communication and transparency about data handling is essential for user trust in LLM-powered XR technologies, along with recommendations for future development.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to clarify the connections between quantum circuit structures and their computational abilities, addressing the challenges in assessing quantum advantage in machine learning models.

Method: The paper develops a framework analyzing parametrized quantum circuits by linking their structural properties to their mathematical function spaces. It examines the impact of circuit depth and non-Clifford gate counts on classical simulability.

Result: The analysis elucidates how specific circuit properties lead to classical simulation potential and distinguishes between models that are fully simulatable, classically tractable, or robustly quantum.

Conclusion: The framework clarifies the landscape of parametrized quantum circuits in the context of classical simulability, highlighting opportunities and distinctions essential for achieving quantum advantage in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.

*Pranav Vaidhyanathan,Aristotelis Papatheodorou,David R. M. Arvidsson-Shukur,Mark T. Mitchison,Natalia Ares,Ioannis Havoutis*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QuantGraph is a quantum-enhanced framework combining control theory and quantum search to improve graph optimization scalability and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the scalability issues of graph-based dynamic programming and improve performance in optimizing complex graph problems.

Method: QuantGraph operates through a two-stage process: a local optimization to prune search spaces using quantum techniques followed by a global optimization stage guided by Grover-adaptive-search and stabilized through model-predictive-control principles.

Result: QuantGraph showed a 60% reduction in search space, a 2x improvement in control-discretization precision, and utilized quadratic speedup with Grover's algorithm.

Conclusion: Through hybrid quantum-classical methods, QuantGraph improves problem-solving efficiency and precision in graph-based optimization, demonstrating potential for scalable implementation.

Abstract: Dynamic programming is a cornerstone of graph-based optimization. While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods.

### [302] [Interpretable Multivariate Conformal Prediction with Fast Transductive Standardization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15383)
*Yunjie Fan,Matteo Sesia*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conformal prediction method for multi-target regression to generate tighter simultaneous prediction intervals that maintain valid coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve prediction interval tightness and coverage in multi-target regression, addressing limitations in existing methods, especially with limited data.

Method: The approach uses coordinate-wise standardization of residuals across dimensions using calibration data, avoiding complex modeling or extra sample splitting.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method produces tighter prediction intervals compared to existing methods while maintaining coverage.

Conclusion: This method advances conformal prediction in multi-target regression by delivering computational efficiency, informative intervals, and valid coverage.

Abstract: We propose a conformal prediction method for constructing tight simultaneous prediction intervals for multiple, potentially related, numerical outputs given a single input. This method can be combined with any multi-target regression model and guarantees finite-sample coverage. It is computationally efficient and yields informative prediction intervals even with limited data. The core idea is a novel \emph{coordinate-wise} standardization procedure that makes residuals across output dimensions directly comparable, estimating suitable scaling parameters using the calibration data themselves. This does not require modeling of cross-output dependence nor auxiliary sample splitting. Implementing this idea requires overcoming technical challenges associated with transductive or full conformal prediction. Experiments on simulated and real data demonstrate this method can produce tighter prediction intervals than existing baselines while maintaining valid simultaneous coverage.

### [303] [Fully Bayesian Spectral Clustering and Benchmarking with Uncertainty Quantification for Small Area Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15643)
*Jairo Fúquene-Patiño*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: A new Bayesian model, FH-SC, for Small Area Estimation incorporates spectral clustering with external covariates, offering improved flexibility and benchmarking techniques. Case study and simulations validate its advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering methods for SAE often rely on geographical or administrative criteria, which limits flexibility in integrating broader covariates. This paper aims to enhance SAE by introducing a model that leverages spectral clustering using external covariates.

Method: The FH-SC model combines the Fay-Herriot approach with spectral clustering. It incorporates posterior projection frameworks and defines new closed-form Rao-Blackwell estimators and a Conditional Posterior Mean Square Error metric.

Result: Advantages of FH-SC over other Bayesian and frequentist approaches are demonstrated through a Colombian case study and simulation studies, showcasing improved modeling and uncertainty measures.

Conclusion: FH-SC provides enhanced flexibility in SAE, effective benchmarking methods, and superior frequentist properties, offering significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this work, inspired by machine learning techniques, we propose a new Bayesian model for Small Area Estimation (SAE), the Fay-Herriot model with Spectral Clustering (FH-SC). Unlike traditional approaches, clustering in FH-SC is based on spectral clustering algorithms that utilize external covariates, rather than geographical or administrative criteria. A major advantage of the FH-SC model is its flexibility in integrating existing SAE approaches, with or without clustering random effects. To enable benchmarking, we leverage the theoretical framework of posterior projections for constrained Bayesian inference and derive closed form expressions for the new Rao-Blackwell (RB) estimators of the posterior mean under the FH-SC model. Additionally, we introduce a novel measure of uncertainty for the benchmarked estimator, the Conditional Posterior Mean Square Error (CPMSE), which is generalizable to other Bayesian SAE estimators. We conduct model-based and data-based simulation studies to evaluate the frequentist properties of the CPMSE. The proposed methodology is motivated by a real case study involving the estimation of the proportion of households with internet access in the municipalities of Colombia. Finally, we also illustrate the advantages of FH-SC over existing Bayesian and frequentist approaches through our case study.

*Alessandro Casadei,Sreyoshi Bhaduri,Rohit Malshe,Pavan Mullapudi,Raj Ratan,Ankush Pole,Arkajit Rakshit*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable mediation analysis framework for high-dimensional causal DAGs, focusing on understanding complex dependencies in operational systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing causality in operational systems such as logistics and cloud infrastructures involves complex, high-dimensional graphs. Traditional methods can't manage the scale or complexity when multiple treatments and mediators are involved.

Method: The authors propose a framework that decomposes total effects into direct and indirect pathways in large-scale causal DAGs by accommodating multiple treatments and mediators. It is applied to real-world case studies for validation.

Result: The framework successfully identifies root causes of issues in fulfillment center logistics, showcasing its capability in dealing with complex dependencies and external factors.

Conclusion: The proposed mediation analysis framework is effective in quantifying mediated pathways, making it highly applicable to modern operational systems with complex interdependencies.

Abstract: Modern operational systems ranging from logistics and cloud infrastructure to industrial IoT, are governed by complex, interdependent processes. Understanding how interventions propagate through such systems requires causal inference methods that go beyond direct effects to quantify mediated pathways. Traditional mediation analysis, while effective in simple settings, fails to scale to the high-dimensional directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) encountered in practice, particularly when multiple treatments and mediators interact. In this paper, we propose a scalable mediation analysis framework tailored for large causal DAGs involving multiple treatments and mediators. Our approach systematically decomposes total effects into interpretable direct and indirect components. We demonstrate its practical utility through applied case studies in fulfillment center logistics, where complex dependencies and non-controllable factors often obscure root causes.

*Pranav Kakhandiki,Sathya Chitturi,Daniel Ratner,Sean Gasiorowski*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This paper introduces NN-BAX, a framework for discovering minimum energy pathways (MEPs) in complex systems, achieving high efficiency with reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational discovery of MEPs is vital for advancing fields like catalysis and biomolecular design. However, current algorithms like NEB are computationally expensive and impractical for complex systems.

Method: NN-BAX combines a neural network foundation model with Bayesian optimization to actively and iteratively refine energy landscapes and MEPs, reducing expensive simulations.

Result: NN-BAX reduced energy and force evaluations by one to two orders of magnitude with minimal loss in accuracy when tested on Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method systems, and it scaled efficiently to >100-dimensional systems.

Conclusion: NN-BAX represents a significant leap in computational efficiency for MEP discovery, making complex scientific applications more feasible by reducing time from weeks to hours or days without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The discovery of a minimum energy pathway (MEP) between metastable states is crucial for scientific tasks including catalyst and biomolecular design. However, the standard nudged elastic band (NEB) algorithm requires hundreds to tens of thousands of compute-intensive simulations, making applications to complex systems prohibitively expensive. We introduce Neural Network Bayesian Algorithm Execution (NN-BAX), a framework that jointly learns the energy landscape and the MEP. NN-BAX sequentially fine-tunes a foundation model by actively selecting samples targeted at improving the MEP. Tested on Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method systems, our approach achieves a one to two order of magnitude reduction in energy and force evaluations with negligible loss in MEP accuracy and demonstrates scalability to >100-dimensional systems. This work is therefore a promising step towards removing the computational barrier for MEP discovery in scientifically relevant systems, suggesting that weeks-long calculations may be achieved in hours or days with minimal loss in accuracy.

*Sahibpreet Singh,Manjit Singh*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper addresses AI-mediated greenwashing in corporate sustainability, comparing criminal liability frameworks across India, the US, and the EU. It advocates for legal reform to tackle algorithmic deception effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine and address the doctrinal gaps in current legal frameworks for holding entities accountable for AI-generated greenwashing, particularly focusing on the application of existing fraud statutes and liability models.

Method: Utilizes a doctrinal legal methodology to analyze judicial precedents, statutory frameworks, and corporate governance models related to AI-mediated greenwashing across different jurisdictions.

Result: Finds that current statutes are inadequate due to their anthropocentric bias, and proposes a hybrid legal framework involving strict liability models, algorithmic due diligence mandates, and ESG-specific reforms. Highlights the EU's CSDDD as a potential transnational model.

Conclusion: Recommends integrating algorithmic accountability with hybrid liability frameworks to ensure that the opacity of AI systems does not impede liability for greenwashing. Emphasizes legal reforms for bridging the gap between technology and jurisprudence.

Abstract: AI-powered greenwashing has emerged as an insidious challenge within corporate sustainability governance, exacerbating the opacity of environmental disclosures and subverting regulatory oversight. This study conducts a comparative legal analysis of criminal liability for AI-mediated greenwashing across India, the US, and the EU, exposing doctrinal lacunae in attributing culpability when deceptive claims originate from algorithmic systems. Existing statutes exhibit anthropocentric biases by predicating liability on demonstrable human intent, rendering them ill-equipped to address algorithmic deception. The research identifies a critical gap in jurisprudential adaptation, as prevailing fraud statutes remain antiquated vis-à-vis AI-generated misrepresentation. Utilising a doctrinal legal methodology, this study systematically dissects judicial precedents and statutory instruments, yielding results regarding the potential expansion of corporate criminal liability. Findings underscore the viability of strict liability models, recalibrated governance frameworks for AI accountability, and algorithmic due diligence mandates under ESG regimes. Comparative insights reveal jurisdictional disparities, with the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) offering a potential transnational model. This study contributes to AI ethics and environmental jurisprudence by advocating for a hybrid liability framework integrating algorithmic risk assessment with legal personhood constructs, ensuring algorithmic opacity does not preclude liability enforcement.

### [307] [How frontier AI companies could implement an internal audit function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14902)
*Francesca Gomez,Adam Buick,Leah Ferentinos,Haelee Kim,Elley Lee*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores internal audit functions for frontier AI developers to manage risks and improve safety governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured internal organizational assurance for managing catastrophic and systemic risks in frontier AI operations.

Method: The paper draws on professional auditing standards, risk-based assurance theories, and AI governance literature to analyze four core design dimensions of internal audits.

Result: Detailed analysis of audit scope, sourcing arrangements, frequency, and access to sensitive information shows how internal audits can enhance safety governance effectively.

Conclusion: Deliberately designed internal audits can strengthen governance, complement external evaluations, and ensure better control over catastrophic risks in frontier AI operations.

Abstract: Frontier AI developers operate at the intersection of rapid technical progress, extreme risk exposure, and growing regulatory scrutiny. While a range of external evaluations and safety frameworks have emerged, comparatively little attention has been paid to how internal organizational assurance should be structured to provide sustained, evidence-based oversight of catastrophic and systemic risks. This paper examines how an internal audit function could be designed to provide meaningful assurance for frontier AI developers, and the practical trade-offs that shape its effectiveness. Drawing on professional internal auditing standards, risk-based assurance theory, and emerging frontier-AI governance literature, we analyze four core design dimensions: (i) audit scope across model-level, system-level, and governance-level controls; (ii) sourcing arrangements (in-house, co-sourced, and outsourced); (iii) audit frequency and cadence; and (iv) access to sensitive information required for credible assurance. For each dimension, we define the relevant option space, assess benefits and limitations, and identify key organizational and security trade-offs. Our findings suggest that internal audit, if deliberately designed for the frontier AI context, can play a central role in strengthening safety governance, complementing external evaluations, and providing boards and regulators with higher-confidence, system-wide assurance over catastrophic risk controls.

*Atte Ojanen,Johannes Anttila,Thilo H. K. Thelitz,Anna Bjork*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in AI governance, utilizing the Delphi method to gather insights on tensions surrounding European AI regulation and anticipatory governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore challenges in AI governance and assess the Delphi method's role in addressing these issues, particularly in Europe.

Method: The authors conducted a two-round Policy Delphi study involving policymakers, researchers, and NGOs on the future of European AI governance.

Result: The Delphi method revealed consensus on prioritizing implementation and enforcement over technical scope, and highlighted a desirability-probability gap regarding desirable policies like citizen participation.

Conclusion: AI governance in Europe requires practical enforcement rather than broad legislative ambitions, and the Delphi method proves effective in uncovering tensions and gaps for anticipatory governance.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present unique challenges for policymakers that seek to govern the technology. In this context, the Delphi method has become an established way to identify consensus and disagreement on emerging technological issues among experts in the field of futures studies and foresight. The aim of this article is twofold: first, it examines key tensions experts see in the development of AI governance in Europe, and second, it reflects on the Delphi method's capacity to inform anticipatory governance of emerging technologies like AI based on these insights. The analysis is based on the results of a two-round Policy Delphi study on the future of AI governance with European policymakers, researchers and NGOs, conducted in mid-2024. The Policy Delphi proved useful in revealing diverse perspectives on European AI governance, drawing out a consensus that future-proof AI regulation will likely depend more on practical implementation and enforcement of legislation than on its technical specifics or scope. Furthermore, the study identified a desirability-probability gap in AI governance: desirable policy directions, like greater citizen participation, were perceived as less probable and feasible. This highlights a tension between desirable regulatory oversight and the practical difficulty for regulation to keep up with technological change.

*Ying Cui,Dongzhe Zheng,Ke Yu,Xiyin Zheng,Xiaorui Wang,Xinxiang Li,Yan Gu,Lin Fu,Xinyi Chen,Wenjie Mei,Xin-Gui Peng*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The study introduces a unified cross-scale framework for identifying and predicting aggressive ccRCC subtypes preoperatively using molecular, pathological, and radiological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current staging methods for ccRCC fail to account for intratumoral heterogeneity, necessitating advanced frameworks for better risk stratification and subtype identification.

Method: A hierarchical framework was developed, combining molecular, histological, and radiological data. Modalities were linked through a molecular-to-pathology-to-radiology supervisory bridge and integrated into nested models (PathoDCCD and RadioDCCD).

Result: PathoDCCD accurately recapitulated molecular subtypes, while RadioDCCD reliably predicted subtypes preoperatively. Consistent predictions correlated with poorer clinical outcomes across five patient cohorts.

Conclusion: Integrating molecular biology, computational pathology, and radiology offers a biologically grounded, noninvasive approach to ccRCC risk stratification and molecular phenotyping.

Abstract: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibits extensive intratumoral heterogeneity on multiple biological scales, contributing to variable clinical outcomes and limiting the effectiveness of conventional TNM staging, which highlights the urgent need for multiscale integrative analytic frameworks. The lipid-deficient de-clear cell differentiated (DCCD) ccRCC subtype, defined by multi-omics analyses, is associated with adverse outcomes even in early-stage disease. Here, we establish a hierarchical cross-scale framework for the preoperative identification of DCCD-ccRCC. At the highest layer, cross-modal mapping transferred molecular signatures to histological and CT phenotypes, establishing a molecular-to-pathology-to-radiology supervisory bridge. Within this framework, each modality-specific model is designed to mirror the inherent hierarchical structure of tumor biology. PathoDCCD captured multi-scale microscopic features, from cellular morphology and tissue architecture to meso-regional organization. RadioDCCD integrated complementary macroscopic information by combining whole-tumor and its habitat-subregions radiomics with a 2D maximal-section heterogeneity metric. These nested models enabled integrated molecular subtype prediction and clinical risk stratification. Across five cohorts totaling 1,659 patients, PathoDCCD reliably recapitulated molecular subtypes, while RadioDCCD provided reliable preoperative prediction. The consistent predictions identified patients with the poorest clinical outcomes. This cross-scale paradigm unifies molecular biology, computational pathology, and quantitative radiology into a biologically grounded strategy for preoperative noninvasive molecular phenotyping of ccRCC.

*Daniel Sánchez Catalina,George T. Cantwell*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm to rank objects based on noisy pairwise comparisons without assuming a known skill-probability relationship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve ranking systems by accounting for noisy pairwise comparisons, such as ranking players in competitive games without prior knowledge of how skill translates to match outcomes.

Method: The paper proposes a Bayesian algorithm to simultaneously infer unobserved strengths and the function mapping strengths to probabilities, using experimental validation and real-world datasets.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates robust performance across various model specifications and is validated on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and robust for ranking objects in scenarios with noisy data, addressing the challenge of unknown skill-probability relationships.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking objects from noisy pairwise comparisons, for example, ranking tennis players from the outcomes of matches. We follow a standard approach to this problem and assume that each object has an unobserved strength and that the outcome of each comparison depends probabilistically on the strengths of the comparands. However, we do not assume to know a priori how skills affect outcomes. Instead, we present an efficient algorithm for simultaneously inferring both the unobserved strengths and the function that maps strengths to probabilities. Despite this problem being under-constrained, we present experimental evidence that the conclusions of our Bayesian approach are robust to different model specifications. We include several case studies to exemplify the method on real-world data sets.

Abstract: With the recent digital revolution, analyzing of tourists' behaviors and research fields associated with it have changed profoundly. It is now easier to examine behaviors of tourists using digital traces they leave during their travels. The studies conducted on diverse aspects of tourism focus on quantitative aspects of digital traces to reach its conclusions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the optimization problem of adding connections to social networks to improve fairness in information access across demographic groups, proposing a scalable solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem arises due to uneven information access among users, especially minority groups, in online social networks, impacted by their disadvantaged positions in the network structure.

Method: The authors formulate the problem using resistance distance to capture multi-path global connectivity, provide a greedy algorithm, and improve its efficiency by leveraging novel approximation techniques to achieve linear-time performance.

Result: The proposed solution is theoretically validated and experimentally demonstrates high accuracy and scalability on networks with millions of nodes using both real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The work offers a practical and scalable method to enhance fairness in information access for online social networks, overcoming computational challenges and addressing a key societal concern.

Abstract: The advent of online social networks has facilitated fast and wide spread of information. However, some users, especially members of minority groups, may be less likely to receive information spreading on the network, due to their disadvantaged network position. We study the optimization problem of adding new connections to a network to enhance fairness in information access among different demographic groups.
  We provide a concrete formulation of this problem where information access is measured in terms of resistance distance, {offering a new perspective that emphasizes global network structure and multi-path connectivity.} The problem is shown to be NP-hard. We propose a simple greedy algorithm which turns out to output accurate solutions, but its run time is cubic, which makes it undesirable for large networks. As our main technical contribution, we reduce its time complexity to linear, leveraging several novel approximation techniques. In addition to our theoretical findings, we also conduct an extensive set of experiments using both real-world and synthetic datasets. We demonstrate that our linear-time algorithm can produce accurate solutions for networks with millions of nodes.

TL;DR: The study introduces 'SoMe,' a benchmark to evaluate large language model (LLM)-based agents in handling social media tasks using diverse datasets and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a comprehensive evaluation platform for LLM-powered social media agents that assess their ability to analyze social media, understand behaviors, and make complex decisions.

Method: Development of a benchmark (SoMe) including 8 tasks, data from social media, and annotated task queries. Performance of LLMs was analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

Result: Mainstream LLMs, both open- and closed-source, were unable to handle social media agent tasks effectively, highlighting their limitations.

Conclusion: SoMe provides a realistic and challenging platform to evaluate and improve LLM-based social media agents, driving future advancements in this field.

Abstract: Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities and gained increasing popularity on social media platforms. While LLM agents are reshaping the ecology of social media, there exists a current gap in conducting a comprehensive evaluation of their ability to comprehend media content, understand user behaviors, and make intricate decisions. To address this challenge, we introduce SoMe, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate social media agents equipped with various agent tools for accessing and analyzing social media data. SoMe comprises a diverse collection of 8 social media agent tasks, 9,164,284 posts, 6,591 user profiles, and 25,686 reports from various social media platforms and external websites, with 17,869 meticulously annotated task queries. Compared with the existing datasets and benchmarks for social media tasks, SoMe is the first to provide a versatile and realistic platform for LLM-based social media agents to handle diverse social media tasks. By extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we provide the first overview insight into the performance of mainstream agentic LLMs in realistic social media environments and identify several limitations. Our evaluation reveals that both the current closed-source and open-source LLMs cannot handle social media agent tasks satisfactorily. SoMe provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future social media agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LivXue/SoMe

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited research on online harassment within private messaging platforms, which are underrepresented compared to public social media research.

Method: Authors used human labelers to initially identify harassment in Instagram messages, then employed an LLM-based pipeline to perform large-scale labeling and simulated response generation to harassment.

Result: The LLM pipeline effectively identified online harassment and the simulated harassment response was found to be more helpful than human responses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of LLMs in detecting and responding effectively to online harassment on private messaging platforms like Instagram.

Abstract: Online harassment has been a persistent issue in the online space. Predominantly, research focused on online harassment in public social media platforms, while less is placed on private messaging platforms. To address online harassment on one private messaging platform, Instagram, we leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we recruited human labelers to identify online harassment in an Instagram messages dataset. Using the previous conversation as context, we utilize an LLM pipeline to conduct large-scale labeling on Instagram messages and evaluate its performance against human labels. Then, we use LLM to generate and evaluate simulated responses to online harassment messages. We find that the LLM labeling pipeline is capable of identifying online harassment in private messages. By comparing human responses and simulated responses, we also demonstrate that our simulated responses are superior in helpfulness compared to original human responses.

Motivation: Current recommendation systems struggle to adapt to evolving user preferences and interactions within complex social networks. More versatile and adaptive solutions are needed.

Method: The proposed algorithm employs swarm intelligence principles, dynamic hypergraph structures, centrality-based feature extraction, Node2Vec embeddings, and message-passing mechanisms for real-time preference modeling.

Result: Experimental results show superior recommendation performance, consistently outperforming baselines using metrics like HR, MRR, and NDCG across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: This algorithm improves recommendation adaptability by effectively integrating individual preferences with community influences. It has broad applicability in social graphs, personalized learning, and medical graphs.

Abstract: Recommendation systems face challenges in dynamically adapting to evolving user preferences and interactions within complex social networks. Traditional approaches often fail to account for the intricate interactions within cyber-social systems and lack the flexibility to generalize across diverse domains, highlighting the need for more adaptive and versatile solutions. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose swarm intelligence algorithm for recommendation systems, designed to adapt seamlessly to varying applications. It was inspired by social psychology principles. The framework models user preferences and community influences within a dynamic hypergraph structure. It leverages centrality-based feature extraction and Node2Vec embeddings. Preference evolution is guided by message-passing mechanisms and hierarchical graph modeling, enabling real-time adaptation to changing behaviors. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the algorithm's superior performance in various recommendation tasks, including social networks and content discovery. Key metrics such as Hit Rate (HR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) consistently outperformed baseline methods across multiple datasets. The model's adaptability to dynamic environments allowed for contextually relevant and precise recommendations. The proposed algorithm represents an advancement in recommendation systems by bridging individual preferences and community influences. Its general-purpose design enables applications in diverse domains, including social graphs, personalized learning, and medical graphs. This work highlights the potential of integrating swarm intelligence with network dynamics to address complex optimization challenges in recommendation systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a nonlinear model to study survival dynamics in weighted economic networks using a combination of mathematical methods, including PDEs and stochastic processes. Numerical tests reveal critical behaviors like heavy-tailed survival and instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand node-level survival dynamics in economic networks, and how factors like graph topology and nonlinear effects influence stability and aggregate behavior.

Method: Combines $p$-Laplacian diffusion operators and stochastic drift in a finite-dimensional PDE–SDE framework, supported by advanced mathematical theories for solution existence, stability analysis, and topology-dependent energy dissipation.

Result: Proved the existence and uniqueness of solutions, derived energy dissipation inequalities based on graph topology, and identified stability thresholds, confirmed by numerical experiments showing nonlinear effects on survival distributions and instability.

Conclusion: The study reveals that hub dominance in networks intensifies nonlinearities and destabilizes survival dynamics, yielding heavy-tailed or possibly explosive outcomes. This highlights the need to consider topology dependence in network survival models.

Abstract: This paper develops a nonlinear evolution framework for modelling survival dynamics on weighted economic networks by coupling a graph-based $p$-Laplacian diffusion operator with a stochastic structural drift. The resulting finite-dimensional PDE--SDE system captures how node-level survival reacts to nonlinear diffusion pressures while an aggregate complexity factor evolves according to an Itô{} process. Using accretive operator theory, nonlinear semigroup methods, and stochastic analysis, we establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions, derive topology-dependent energy dissipation inequalities, and characterise the stability threshold separating dissipative, critical, amplifying, and explosive regimes. Numerical experiments on Barabási--Albert networks confirm that hub dominance magnifies nonlinear gradients and compresses stability margins, producing heavy-tailed survival distributions and occasional explosive behaviour.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently computes edge p-Laplacian centralities by leveraging a transformed graph model and a newly developed algorithm.

Abstract: The problem that we would like to solve in this paper is to compute the edge p-Laplacian centrality for the air traffic network. In this problem, instead of computing the edge p-Laplacian centrality directly which is the very hard problem, we convert the air traffic network to the line graph. Finally, we will compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph which is equivalent to the edge p-Laplacian of the air traffic network. In this paper, the novel un-normalized graph (p-) Laplacian based ranking method will be developed based on the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian operator definitions such as the curvature operator of graph (i.e. the un-normalized graph 1-Laplacian operator) and will be used to compute the node p-Laplacian centrality of the line graph. The results from the experiments show that the un-normalized graph p-Laplacian ranking methods can be implemented successfully.

### [319] [Privacy-Preserving Feature Valuation in Vertical Federated Learning Using Shapley-CMI and PSI Permutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14767)
*Unai Laskurain,Aitor Aguirre-Ortuzar,Urko Zurutuza*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a privacy-preserving implementation of the Shapley-CMI method for evaluating feature contribution in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) without sharing raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mechanism for securely and fairly evaluating feature contribution in VFL, especially in early stages without existing models.

Method: The system integrates a private set intersection (PSI) server to handle encrypted feature permutations and intersection sizes, allowing computation of Shapley-CMI values without sharing raw data.

Result: Experiments validated the correctness, privacy preservation, and scalability of the proposed system for multiple parties.

Conclusion: The approach ensures secure, scalable, and fair data valuation for VFL while preserving data confidentiality and eliminating the need for model training or raw data exchange.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, ensuring data privacy. In Vertical FL (VFL), where each party holds different features for the same users, a key challenge is to evaluate the feature contribution of each party before any model is trained, particularly in the early stages when no model exists. To address this, the Shapley-CMI method was recently proposed as a model-free, information-theoretic approach to feature valuation using Conditional Mutual Information (CMI). However, its original formulation did not provide a practical implementation capable of computing the required permutations and intersections securely. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving implementation of Shapley-CMI for VFL. Our system introduces a private set intersection (PSI) server that performs all necessary feature permutations and computes encrypted intersection sizes across discretized and encrypted ID groups, without the need for raw data exchange. Each party then uses these intersection results to compute Shapley-CMI values, computing the marginal utility of their features. Initial experiments confirm the correctness and privacy of the proposed system, demonstrating its viability for secure and efficient feature contribution estimation in VFL. This approach ensures data confidentiality, scales across multiple parties, and enables fair data valuation without requiring the sharing of raw data or training models.

### [320] [SeBERTis: A Framework for Producing Classifiers of Security-Related Issue Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15003)
*Sogol Masoumzadeh,Yufei Li,Shane McIntosh,Dániel Varró,Lili Wei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents SEBERTIS, a new framework for detecting security-related issues in software, which outperforms existing techniques in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the early detection of high-risk, security-related software issues that existing methods struggle with due to reliance on lexical cues.

Method: The paper introduces SEBERTIS, a framework fine-tuning transformers as Masked Language Models using semantically equivalent surrogates to create robust classifiers independent of lexical cues.

Result: SEBERTIS achieved a 0.9880 F1-score on a 10,000-issue GitHub dataset, outperforming traditional ML models and LLMs by considerable margins in precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: SEBERTIS effectively addresses prior limitations by creating a robust and highly accurate classifier, suitable for real-time detection of security-related software issues.

Abstract: Monitoring issue tracker submissions is a crucial software maintenance activity. A key goal is the prioritization of high risk, security-related bugs. If such bugs can be recognized early, the risk of propagation to dependent products and endangerment of stakeholder benefits can be mitigated. To assist triage engineers with this task, several automatic detection techniques, from Machine Learning (ML) models to prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), have been proposed. Although promising to some extent, prior techniques often memorize lexical cues as decision shortcuts, yielding low detection rate specifically for more complex submissions. As such, these classifiers do not yet reach the practical expectations of a real-time detector of security-related issues. To address these limitations, we propose SEBERTIS, a framework to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as classifiers independent of lexical cues, so that they can confidently detect fully unseen security-related issues. SEBERTIS capitalizes on fine-tuning bidirectional transformer architectures as Masked Language Models (MLMs) on a series of semantically equivalent vocabulary to prediction labels (which we call Semantic Surrogates) when they have been replaced with a mask. Our SEBERTIS-trained classifier achieves a 0.9880 F1-score in detecting security-related issues of a curated corpus of 10,000 GitHub issue reports, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art issue classifiers, with 14.44%-96.98%, 15.40%-93.07%, and 14.90%-94.72% higher detection precision, recall, and F1-score over ML-based baselines. Our classifier also substantially surpasses LLM baselines, with an improvement of 23.20%-63.71%, 36.68%-85.63%, and 39.49%-74.53% for precision, recall, and F1-score.

*Zhenhao Yin,Hanbing Yan,Huishu Lu,Jing Xiong,Xiangyu Li,Rui Mei,Tianning Zang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces APT-ClaritySet, a dataset for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) research, addressing issues of alias inconsistency and sample redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced Persistent Threat research is hindered by scarce standardized datasets, inconsistent actor aliases, and redundant samples, impeding reproducibility and study reliability.

Method: The authors developed APT-ClaritySet using a pipeline for alias normalization and graph-feature deduplication, reducing redundant executables by 47.55% while retaining distinct behavioral variants.

Result: APT-ClaritySet was constructed in three forms: full collection (34,363 samples from 305 APT groups), deduplicated release (25,923 samples, 303 groups), and a function-level resource (324,538 function-reuse clusters).

Conclusion: APT-ClaritySet provides a standardized, high-fidelity dataset to support reproducible APT research, facilitating studies on patterns, evolution, and attribution.

Abstract: Large-scale, standardized datasets for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) research are scarce, and inconsistent actor aliases and redundant samples hinder reproducibility. This paper presents APT-ClaritySet and its construction pipeline that normalizes threat actor aliases (reconciling approximately 11.22\% of inconsistent names) and applies graph-feature deduplication -- reducing the subset of statically analyzable executables by 47.55\% while retaining behaviorally distinct variants. APT-ClaritySet comprises: (i) APT-ClaritySet-Full, the complete pre-deduplication collection with 34{,}363 malware samples attributed to 305 APT groups (2006 - early 2025); (ii) APT-ClaritySet-Unique, the deduplicated release with 25{,}923 unique samples spanning 303 groups and standardized attributions; and (iii) APT-ClaritySet-FuncReuse, a function-level resource that includes 324{,}538 function-reuse clusters (FRCs) enabling measurement of inter-/intra-group sharing, evolution, and tooling lineage. By releasing these components and detailing the alias normalization and scalable deduplication pipeline, this work provides a high-fidelity, reproducible foundation for quantitative studies of APT patterns, evolution, and attribution.

### [322] [Zero-Knowledge Audit for Internet of Agents: Privacy-Preserving Communication Verification with Model Context Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14737)
*Guanlin Jing,Huayi Qi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework combining zero-knowledge proofs with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to audit agent communications privately and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the critical challenge of protecting privacy in agent communications while ensuring auditability, especially in applications requiring compliance, accurate billing, and accountability.

Method: The method integrates zero-knowledge proofs with MCP, allowing verification of message compliance without revealing content. It operates on lightweight networks and supports asynchronous audit verification.

Result: The framework achieves data authenticity and communication privacy with minimal latency, enabling verifiable mutual audits. It is implemented using a Circom-based zero-knowledge proof system within MCP.

Conclusion: The system is the first to provide a privacy-preserving audit for agent communications, simultaneously ensuring message privacy and verifiable compliance.

Abstract: Existing agent communication frameworks face critical limitations in providing verifiable audit trails without compromising the privacy and confidentiality of agent interactions. The protection of agent communication privacy while ensuring auditability emerges as a fundamental challenge for applications requiring accurate billing, compliance verification, and accountability in regulated environments.
  We introduce a framework for auditing agent communications that keeps messages private while still checking they follow expected rules. It pairs zero-knowledge proofs with the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) so messages can be verified without revealing their contents. The approach runs in lightweight networks, stays compatible with standard MCP exchanges, and adds asynchronous audit verification to confirm format and general message types without exposing specifics.
  The framework enables mutual audits between agents: one side can check communication content and quality while the other verifies usage metrics, all without revealing sensitive information. We formalize security goals and show that zk-MCP provides data authenticity and communication privacy, achieving efficient verification with negligible latency overhead. We fully implement the framework, including Circom-based zero-knowledge proof generation and an audit protocol integrated with MCP's bidirectional channel, and, to our knowledge, this is the first privacy-preserving audit system for agent communications that offers verifiable mutual auditing without exposing message content or compromising agent privacy.

*Jing Cui,Yufei Han,Jianbin Jiao,Junge Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper studies implanted backdoors in large language models and introduces the P-Trojan attack algorithm that maintains backdoor persistence during post-deployment updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the persistence of backdoor attacks during continual fine-tuning of large language models and address the need for stronger defenses.

Method: P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm, aligns poisoned gradients with clean task gradients to optimize backdoor persistence across multiple updates.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 demonstrate over 99% backdoor persistence while maintaining clean-task accuracy across various task sequences.

Conclusion: Backdoor persistence is feasible under continual fine-tuning, emphasizing the need for improved evaluation and robust defenses in real-world adaptation pipelines.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed malicious behaviors into Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to trigger harmful outputs or bypass safety controls. However, the persistence of the implanted backdoors under user-driven post-deployment continual fine-tuning has been rarely examined. Most prior works evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of implanted backdoors only at releasing and empirical evidence shows that naively injected backdoor persistence degrades after updates. In this work, we study whether and how implanted backdoors persist through a multi-stage post-deployment fine-tuning. We propose P-Trojan, a trigger-based attack algorithm that explicitly optimizes for backdoor persistence across repeated updates. By aligning poisoned gradients with those of clean tasks on token embeddings, the implanted backdoor mapping is less likely to be suppressed or forgotten during subsequent updates. Theoretical analysis shows the feasibility of such persistent backdoor attacks after continual fine-tuning. And experiments conducted on the Qwen2.5 and LLaMA3 families of LLMs, as well as diverse task sequences, demonstrate that P-Trojan achieves over 99% persistence while preserving clean-task accuracy. Our findings highlight the need for persistence-aware evaluation and stronger defenses in realistic model adaptation pipelines.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical defense framework for cybersecurity in Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN), utilizing hybrid quantum computing and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities in O-RAN caused by its modularity and granular telemetry.

Method: A hybrid quantum and machine learning-based hierarchical defense framework with three layers: anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation, and multi-attack classification. It aligns this approach with O-RAN's telemetry stack and extensively benchmarks its performance.

Result: The framework exhibits near-perfect accuracy, high recall, and strong classification capability, proving its robustness across synthetic and real-world telemetry evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is shown to be interpretable, robust, and scalable, making it suited for deployment in O-RAN's near-RT and non-RT RIC domains for effective cybersecurity diagnostics.

Abstract: Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) enhance modularity and telemetry granularity but also widen the cybersecurity attack surface across disaggregated control, user and management planes. We propose a hierarchical defense framework with three coordinated layers-anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation, and multiattack classification-each aligned with O-RAN's telemetry stack. Our approach integrates hybrid quantum computing and machine learning, leveraging amplitude- and entanglement-based feature encodings with deep and ensemble classifiers. We conduct extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world telemetry, evaluating encoding depth, architectural variants, and diagnostic fidelity. The framework consistently achieves near-perfect accuracy, high recall, and strong class separability. Multi-faceted evaluation across decision boundaries, probabilistic margins, and latent space geometry confirms its interpretability, robustness, and readiness for slice-aware diagnostics and scalable deployment in near-RT and non-RT RIC domains.

### [325] [Factor(U,T): Controlling Untrusted AI by Monitoring their Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14745)
*Edward Lue Chee Lip,Anthony Channg,Diana Kim,Aaron Sandoval,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the risk of using powerful yet untrusted AI models to decompose tasks under the Factor(U,T) framework for factored cognition. It shows that monitoring decomposition-only instructions does not effectively detect malicious behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of safely decomposing tasks using untrusted AI models, as current approaches rely on weaker trusted models, which limit decomposer functionality.

Method: The authors introduce Factor(U,T), where an untrusted but stronger model creates task decompositions, supervised by monitoring systems that evaluate decomposition instructions. They conduct control evaluations using BigCodeBench and compare monitoring approaches.

Result: Monitoring decomposition-only instructions performs poorly (AUROC 0.52), while monitoring completed solutions performs far better (AUROC 0.96). Additionally, alternative method Factor(D,U) with trusted decomposition achieves high safety (1.2% ASR) and discrimination.

Conclusion: Decomposition-only monitoring is insufficient for detecting malicious behavior in untrusted models. Trusted decomposition models combined with implementation-context monitoring provide safer and efficient task resolution.

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance, we increasingly rely on powerful models to decompose complex tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ but what if the decomposer itself is malicious? Factored cognition protocols decompose complex tasks into simpler child tasks: one model creates the decomposition, while other models implement the child tasks in isolation. Prior work uses trusted (weaker but reliable) models for decomposition, which limits usefulness for tasks where decomposition itself is challenging. We introduce Factor($U$,$T$), in which an untrusted (stronger but potentially malicious) model decomposes while trusted models implement child tasks. Can monitors detect malicious activity when observing only natural language task instructions, rather than complete solutions? We baseline and red team Factor($U$,$T$) in control evaluations on BigCodeBench, a dataset of Python coding tasks. Monitors distinguishing malicious from honest decompositions perform poorly (AUROC 0.52) compared to monitors evaluating complete Python solutions (AUROC 0.96). Furthermore, Factor($D$,$U$), which uses a trusted decomposer and monitors concrete child solutions, achieves excellent discrimination (AUROC 0.96) and strong safety (1.2% ASR), demonstrating that implementation-context monitoring succeeds where decomposition-only monitoring fails.

*Yixin Tan,Zhe Yu,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies whether finetuned large language models (LLMs) inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained counterparts and proposes a probing-based attack showing strong transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if finetuned LLMs inherit security vulnerabilities from their pretrained models and identify their implications for secure downstream application development.

Method: The authors conducted empirical analysis, representation-level probing, and proposed a Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack focusing on transferability-relevant directions.

Result: Findings reveal that adversarial prompts optimized on pretrained models transfer effectively to finetuned variants, and PGP attack demonstrates strong transfer success across multiple LLM families.

Conclusion: Finetuned LLMs inherit vulnerabilities from pretrained models, posing significant security risks in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.

Abstract: Finetuning pretrained large language models (LLMs) has become the standard paradigm for developing downstream applications. However, its security implications remain unclear, particularly regarding whether finetuned LLMs inherit jailbreak vulnerabilities from their pretrained sources. We investigate this question in a realistic pretrain-to-finetune threat model, where the attacker has white-box access to the pretrained LLM and only black-box access to its finetuned derivatives. Empirical analysis shows that adversarial prompts optimized on the pretrained model transfer most effectively to its finetuned variants, revealing inherited vulnerabilities from pretrained to finetuned LLMs. To further examine this inheritance, we conduct representation-level probing, which shows that transferable prompts are linearly separable within the pretrained hidden states, suggesting that universal transferability is encoded in pretrained representations. Building on this insight, we propose the Probe-Guided Projection (PGP) attack, which steers optimization toward transferability-relevant directions. Experiments across multiple LLM families and diverse finetuned tasks confirm PGP's strong transfer success, underscoring the security risks inherent in the pretrain-to-finetune paradigm.

*Li Lin,Siyuan Xin,Yang Cao,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of current Large Language Model (LLM) code watermarking techniques, introducing a method for embedding watermarks that is resilient to comment removal attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking techniques for LLM-generated code are ineffective against comment removal attacks and fail to account for the low-entropy nature of most code.

Method: The authors use a Cue List to identify low and high-entropy parts of code, then strategically embed watermarks for better detectability and robustness.

Result: The proposed watermarking method demonstrated higher detectability and usability compared to three state-of-the-art techniques when evaluated on HumanEval.

Conclusion: The introduced technique offers an enhanced solution for watermarking LLM-generated code, overcoming major vulnerabilities of existing methods.

Abstract: Watermarking large language models (LLMs) is vital for preventing their misuse, including the fabrication of fake news, plagiarism, and spam. It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language. Our approach to addressing this issue involves leveraging prior knowledge to distinguish between low-entropy and high-entropy parts of the code, as indicated by a Cue List of words.We then inject the watermark guided by this Cue List, achieving higher detectability and usability than existing methods.We evaluated our proposed method on HumanEvaland compared our method with three state-of-the-art code watermarking techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [328] [Quantifying Return on Security Controls in LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15081)
*Richard Helder Moulton,Austin O'Brien,John D. Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology to quantify risks and evaluate financial impacts in safeguarding LLM-based systems against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly utilized in security-critical applications, but practitioners lack quantitative tools to assess and compare protections.

Method: A decision-oriented framework is developed to simulate financial risk and return-on-control metrics for adversarial attacks on a retrieval-augmented generation service, employing multiple vulnerabilities and defenses.

Result: Baseline systems showed high vulnerability and significant potential losses ($313k per scenario). Specific safeguards reduced risks and losses, with ABAC being the most effective (RoC of 9.83).

Conclusion: Layered safeguards can effectively minimize risks and financial losses associated with LLMs, emphasizing the need for tailored security protocols.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in security-critical workflows, practitioners lack quantitative guidance on which safeguards are worth deploying. This paper introduces a decision-oriented framework and reproducible methodology that together quantify residual risk, convert adversarial probe outcomes into financial risk estimates and return-on-control (RoC) metrics, and enable monetary comparison of layered defenses for LLM-based systems. A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) service is instantiated using the DeepSeek-R1 model over a corpus containing synthetic personally identifiable information (PII), and subjected to automated attacks with Garak across five vulnerability classes: PII leakage, latent context injection, prompt injection, adversarial attack generation, and divergence. For each (vulnerability, control) pair, attack success probabilities are estimated via Laplace's Rule of Succession and combined with loss triangle distributions, calibrated from public breach-cost data, in 10,000-run Monte Carlo simulations to produce loss exceedance curves and expected losses. Three widely used mitigations, attribute-based access control (ABAC); named entity recognition (NER) redaction using Microsoft Presidio; and NeMo Guardrails, are then compared to a baseline RAG configuration. The baseline system exhibits very high attack success rates (>= 0.98 for PII, latent injection, and prompt injection), yielding a total simulated expected loss of $313k per attack scenario. ABAC collapses success probabilities for PII and prompt-related attacks to near zero and reduces the total expected loss by ~94%, achieving an RoC of 9.83. NER redaction likewise eliminates PII leakage and attains an RoC of 5.97, while NeMo Guardrails provides only marginal benefit (RoC of 0.05).

*Arth Bhardwaj,Sia Godika,Yuvam Loonker*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), utilizing coordinated LLM agents for real-time security tasks, showing improved accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized security tools often struggle with adaptive, multi-vector attacks in real-time scenarios, creating the need for a robust, cooperative cyber defense system.

Method: The framework employs four specialized LLM agents (Detection, Intelligence, Response, Analysis) communicating through a Secure Communication Layer for solving cyber security tasks together. Evaluation uses CICIDS2017 schema and a 50-record live stream compared against a baseline ML model.

Result: MALCDF achieved 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, 9.1% false-positive rate, and an average latency of 6.8s per event, surpassing the ML-IDS baseline and single-LLM setup in accuracy.

Conclusion: Coordinated LLM agents can significantly enhance real-time cyber defense capabilities, offering higher accuracy and consistent outputs compared to traditional and single LLM systems.

Abstract: Traditional, centralized security tools often miss adaptive, multi-vector attacks. We present the Multi-Agent LLM Cyber Defense Framework (MALCDF), a practical setup where four large language model (LLM) agents-Detection, Intelligence, Response, and Analysis-work together in real time. Agents communicate over a Secure Communication Layer (SCL) with encrypted, ontology-aligned messages, and produce audit-friendly outputs (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK mappings).
  For evaluation, we keep the test simple and consistent: all reported metrics come from the same 50-record live stream derived from the CICIDS2017 feature schema. CICIDS2017 is used for configuration (fields/schema) and to train a practical ML baseline. The ML-IDS baseline is a Lightweight Random Forest IDS (LRF-IDS) trained on a subset of CICIDS2017 and tested on the 50-record stream, with no overlap between training and test records.
  In experiments, MALCDF reaches 90.0% detection accuracy, 85.7% F1-score, and 9.1% false-positive rate, with 6.8s average per-event latency. It outperforms the lightweight ML-IDS baseline and a single-LLM setup on accuracy while keeping end-to-end outputs consistent. Overall, this hands-on build suggests that coordinating simple LLM agents with secure, ontology-aligned messaging can improve practical, real-time cyber defense.

*Viet K. Nguyen,Mohammad I. Husain*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper systematically evaluates the security vulnerabilities of agentic AI systems across multiple models and frameworks through penetration testing. It reveals significant security disparities, including low refusal rates against malicious prompts, and offers recommendations for secure agent deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored security vulnerabilities of agentic AI systems and understand how they perform when tasked with malicious prompts.

Method: Systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of five models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, Nova Pro) across two frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a specialized architecture and 13 distinct attack scenarios.

Result: Significant variability in security performance was observed, with refusal rates ranging from 15.4% to 52.3%. A key finding was that many models still allowed execution of malicious prompts despite advanced safety mechanisms.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems display substantial vulnerabilities and inconsistent defensive behavior, necessitating targeted improvements in safeguards and deployment strategies. Recommendations and attack details are provided for addressing these issues.

Abstract: Agentic AI introduces security vulnerabilities that traditional LLM safeguards fail to address. Although recent work by Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks demonstrated that ChatGPT-4o successfully executes attacks as an agent that it refuses in chat mode, there is no comparative analysis in multiple models and frameworks. We conducted the first systematic penetration testing and comparative evaluation of agentic AI systems, testing five prominent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 2, and Nova Pro) across two agentic AI frameworks (AutoGen and CrewAI) using a seven-agent architecture that mimics the functionality of a university information management system and 13 distinct attack scenarios that span prompt injection, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), SQL injection, and tool misuse. Our 130 total test cases reveal significant security disparities: AutoGen demonstrates a 52.3% refusal rate versus CrewAI's 30.8%, while model performance ranges from Nova Pro's 46.2% to Claude and Grok 2's 38.5%. Most critically, Grok 2 on CrewAI rejected only 2 of 13 attacks (15.4% refusal rate), and the overall refusal rate of 41.5% across all configurations indicates that more than half of malicious prompts succeeded despite enterprise-grade safety mechanisms. We identify six distinct defensive behavior patterns including a novel "hallucinated compliance" strategy where models fabricate outputs rather than executing or refusing attacks, and provide actionable recommendations for secure agent deployment. Complete attack prompts are also included in the Appendix to enable reproducibility.

*Nnamdi Philip Okonkwo,Lubna Luxmi Dhirani*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The research presents an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) for cloud security on AWS, using ML-based detection and calibrated fusion for effective threat triage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry and tight budgets in cloud Security Operations Centers (SOC).

Method: The AISOC leverages cloud-native tools, AWS architecture, simulated reverse-shell intrusions, and ML-based classifiers. Logs are synthetically augmented and fused for threat intelligence.

Result: Calibrated fusion achieves strong macro-F1 scores (up to 1.00) in controlled tests, showing potential for cost-effective cloud SOC enhancement.

Conclusion: Simple, calibrated fusion techniques can boost capability in cloud SOC setups while adhering to cost constraints and providing multi-modal threat intelligence.

Abstract: Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) enable cloud governance, risk and compliance by providing insights visibility and control. Cloud SOC triages high-volume, heterogeneous telemetry from elastic, short-lived resources while staying within tight budgets. In this research, we implement an AI-Augmented Security Operations Center (AISOC) on AWS that combines cloud-native instrumentation with ML-based detection. The architecture uses three Amazon EC2 instances: Attacker, Defender, and Monitoring. We simulate a reverse-shell intrusion with Metasploit, and Filebeat forwards Defender logs to an Elasticsearch and Kibana stack for analysis. We train two classifiers, a malware detector built on a public dataset and a log-anomaly detector trained on synthetically augmented logs that include adversarial variants. We calibrate and fuse the scores to produce multi-modal threat intelligence and triage activity into NORMAL, SUSPICIOUS, and HIGH\_CONFIDENCE\_ATTACK. On held-out tests the fusion achieves strong macro-F1 (up to 1.00) under controlled conditions, though performance will vary in noisier and more diverse environments. These results indicate that simple, calibrated fusion can enhance cloud SOC capabilities in constrained, cost-sensitive setups.

Result: Identified structural differences between attack types and benign data, supporting the feasibility of ML-based classification.

Conclusion: The findings provide a solid basis for enhancing IoV security through machine learning.

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has evolved modern transportation through enhanced connectivity and intelligent systems. However, this increased connectivity introduces critical vulnerabilities, making vehicles susceptible to cyber-attacks such Denial-ofService (DoS) and message spoofing. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to classify malicious Controller Area network (CAN) bus traffic using the CiCIoV2024 benchmark dataset. We analyzed various attack patterns including DoS and spoofing attacks targeting critical vehicle parameters such as Spoofing-GAS - gas pedal position, Spoofing-RPM, Spoofing-Speed, and Spoofing-Steering\_Wheel. Our initial findings confirm a multi-class classification problem with a clear structural difference between attack types and benign data, providing a strong foundation for machine learning models.

*Konstantinos Kalogiannis,Ahmed Mohamed Hussain,Hexu Li,Panos Papadimitratos*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIMformer, a transformer-based model for real-time misbehavior detection in vehicular platooning, enhancing safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security vulnerabilities in vehicular platoons caused by falsified data and miscoordination due to the distributed nature of control.

Method: AIMformer employs transformer-based multi-head self-attention to analyze intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations and incorporates a loss function penalizing false positives.

Result: The model exhibits superior performance (≥ 0.93) in detecting misbehavior across varied scenarios and ensures sub-millisecond inference latency suitable for edge platforms.

Conclusion: AIMformer is a robust and efficient solution for edge-deployed real-time misbehavior detection in vehicular platoons, effectively enhancing safety and reliability.

Abstract: Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BashArena, a platform to test AI control techniques in security-critical scenarios, emphasizing sabotage detection and prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure misaligned AI agents with elevated privileges don't cause damage, effective AI control techniques need to be developed and tested.

Method: They designed BashArena, a domain with 637 Linux system tasks and four sabotage scenarios, assessing various LLMs on task performance and sabotage detection.

Result: Claude Sonnet 4.5 was shown to successfully execute sabotage undetected by GPT-4.1 mini in 26% of cases, with a 4% false positive rate.

Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of robust control protocols and propose BashArena as a benchmark for further development, with dataset and tools publicly shared.

Abstract: Future AI agents might run autonomously with elevated privileges. If these agents are misaligned, they might abuse these privileges to cause serious damage. The field of AI control develops techniques that make it harder for misaligned AIs to cause such damage, while preserving their usefulness. We introduce BashArena, a setting for studying AI control techniques in security-critical environments. BashArena contains 637 Linux system administration and infrastructure engineering tasks in complex, realistic environments, along with four sabotage objectives (execute malware, exfiltrate secrets, escalate privileges, and disable firewall) for a red team to target. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs on their ability to complete tasks, perform sabotage undetected, and detect sabotage attempts. Claude Sonnet 4.5 successfully executes sabotage while evading monitoring by GPT-4.1 mini 26% of the time, at 4% trajectory-wise FPR. Our findings provide a baseline for designing more effective control protocols in BashArena. We release the dataset as a ControlArena setting and share our task generation pipeline.

*Conor Rowan,Kai Hampleman,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper investigates boundary condition enforcement techniques for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) within complex 3D geometries and proposes a general solution framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited exploration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) on complex three-dimensional geometries and their current challenges in boundary condition enforcement.

Method: The authors systematically compare various boundary condition enforcement strategies, propose a general framework for solving arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and verify its efficacy through test cases involving different boundary conditions and both linear and nonlinear problems.

Result: The proposed framework succeeds in handling three-dimensional problems and boundary conditions across diverse scenarios, requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: The work contributes towards establishing PINNs as a robust numerical method, competing effectively with traditional methods like the finite element method.

Abstract: Since their advent nearly a decade ago, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been studied extensively as a novel technique for solving forward and inverse problems in physics and engineering. The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. This work represents a step in the direction of establishing PINNs as a mature numerical method, capable of competing head-to-head with incumbents such as the finite element method.

### [336] [Learning continuous SOC-dependent thermal decomposition kinetics for Li-ion cathodes using KA-CRNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15628)
*Benjamin C. Koenig,Sili Deng*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to model SOC-dependent thermal runaway behaviors in lithium-ion batteries using KA-CRNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries fail to capture continuous SOC-dependent behaviors due to limited representation of kinetic parameters.

Method: The authors employ the physics-based KA-CRNN framework to infer continuous SOC-dependent parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition from experimental DSC data.

Result: The framework successfully reproduces DSC heat-release profiles across different SOCs for multiple cathodes (NCA, NM, NMA) while providing interpretable insights into SOC-dependent mechanisms.

Conclusion: The approach enhances predictive modeling for lithium-ion battery abuse conditions, providing interpretable and continuous insights into SOC-influenced parameters while laying groundwork for extended dependencies in predictive models.

Abstract: Thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries is strongly influenced by the state of charge (SOC). Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised learning method for enhancing whole-slide image analysis by linking low and high-magnification features, offering robust, scalable neuropathology workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitation of current self-supervised methods that treat different magnification levels in whole-slide images independently, which hinders resolution-invariant representation learning and practical pathology applications.

Method: The study proposes MAD, a self-supervised strategy that connects low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail. The method enables the model to link coarse tissue structures with detailed cellular patterns without requiring annotations.

Result: The MAD-NP model, trained with cross-scale correspondence, achieves strong resolution-invariant representation learning. A linear classifier trained on 10x magnification maintains 96.7% performance when applied to 40x tiles, and segmentation results remain consistent across magnifications.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust analysis of whole-slide images using MAD, paving the way for improved and practical neuropathology workflows.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space

TL;DR: AI model developed to predict surgical feasibility for Advanced Ovarian Cancer using diagnostic laparoscopy videos, offering automated Fagotti score assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reproducibility and reliability of surgical planning for Advanced Ovarian Cancer, overcoming limitations of subjective Fagotti score assessments.

Method: Deep learning models trained on annotated laparoscopy video frames to automatically segment anatomical structures and peritoneal carcinosis, classify anatomical sites, predict Fagotti score, and determine surgical indication.

Result: Segmentation achieved Dice scores of up to 70% for anatomical structures and 56% for peritoneal carcinosis. Video classification and indication prediction reached high F1-scores, and feasibility estimations demonstrated promising reliability.

Conclusion: The AI model provides a standardized method for intraoperative tumor burden assessment, supporting clinical decisions for Advanced Ovarian Cancer surgeries.

Abstract: Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage with peritoneal carcinosis (PC). Fagotti score (FS) assessment at diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) guides treatment planning by estimating surgical resectability, but its subjective and operator-dependent nature limits reproducibility and widespread use. Videos of patients undergoing DL with concomitant FS assessments at a referral center were retrospectively collected and divided into a development dataset, for data annotation, AI training and evaluation, and an independent test dataset, for internal validation. In the development dataset, FS-relevant frames were manually annotated for anatomical structures and PC. Deep learning models were trained to automatically identify FS-relevant frames, segment structures and PC, and predict video-level FS and indication to surgery (ItS). AI performance was evaluated using Dice score for segmentation, F1-scores for anatomical stations (AS) and ItS prediction, and root mean square error (RMSE) for final FS estimation. In the development dataset, the segmentation model trained on 7,311 frames, achieved Dice scores of 70$\pm$3% for anatomical structures and 56$\pm$3% for PC. Video-level AS classification achieved F1-scores of 74$\pm$3% and 73$\pm$4%, FS prediction showed normalized RMSE values of 1.39$\pm$0.18 and 1.15$\pm$0.08, and ItS reached F1-scores of 80$\pm$8% and 80$\pm$2% in the development (n=101) and independent test datasets (n=50), respectively. This is the first AI model to predict the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery providing automated FS estimation from DL videos. Its reproducible and reliable performance across datasets suggests that AI can support surgeons through standardized intraoperative tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making in AOC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images, focusing on improving segmentation methods for optic disc and cup using few-shot weakly-supervised learning approaches.

Method: Introduced Omni meta-training to diversify shots and improve data usage, developed efficient versions of meta-learners to reduce computational costs, and applied sparsification techniques for robust label generation.

Result: EO-ProtoSeg achieved superior IoU scores for OD and OC across multiple datasets (e.g., 88.15% IoU for OD and 71.17% for OC on REFUGE using one sparse labeled image) outperforming existing few-shot and semi-supervised methods.

Conclusion: Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg) is an effective, computationally light, and robust approach for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation, showing strong performance on multiple datasets using minimal labeled data.

Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced method for Atomic Electron Tomography (AET) that directly determines atomic locations and properties using a Gaussian parameterization, showcasing improved robustness against imaging artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of classical tomography methods which process intermediate volumetric representations for atomic structures, and to improve robustness to imaging artifacts in practical applications.

Method: The authors reformulate the tomographic inverse problem by parameterizing atomic structures as Gaussian collections to directly learn atomic locations and properties, eliminating intermediate volumetric representations.

Result: Simulation experiments and proof-of-concept results demonstrate the method's improved robustness for imaging artifacts and practical applications in materials analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy.

Conclusion: The Gaussian parameterization approach improves accuracy and robustness, offering potential practical utility in materials characterization through enhanced atomic structure determination directly from imaging data.

Abstract: Atomic electron tomography (AET) enables the determination of 3D atomic structures by acquiring a sequence of 2D tomographic projection measurements of a particle and then computationally solving for its underlying 3D representation. Classical tomography algorithms solve for an intermediate volumetric representation that is post-processed into the atomic structure of interest. In this paper, we reformulate the tomographic inverse problem to solve directly for the locations and properties of individual atoms. We parameterize an atomic structure as a collection of Gaussians, whose positions and properties are learnable. This representation imparts a strong physical prior on the learned structure, which we show yields improved robustness to real-world imaging artifacts. Simulated experiments and a proof-of-concept result on experimentally-acquired data confirm our method's potential for practical applications in materials characterization and analysis with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

TL;DR: The paper proposes using ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T with a deep-learning pipeline for simultaneous high-quality metabolic, QSM, and MWF brain mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by large water sidebands in water-unsuppressed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (wu-MRSI) for metabolic fitting, especially at ultra-high field strengths.

Method: Developed a deep-learning pipeline that includes WALINET+ to suppress water and sidebands and DeepER for MRSI reconstruction. Utilized various imaging techniques at 7T for multi-functional brain mapping.

Result: Achieved low error and high signal fidelity for metabolic quantification using wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF from wu-MRSI showed good agreement with separate methods and higher accuracy with metabolites such as creatine and glutamate.

Conclusion: The pipeline allows simultaneous, precise measurements of brain metabolites, QSM, and MWF without the need for separate acquisitions or water suppression, offering a powerful tool for brain imaging at ultra-high fields.

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) maps endogenous brain metabolism while suppressing the overwhelming water signal. Water-unsuppressed MRSI (wu-MRSI) allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites, but large water sidebands cause challenges for metabolic fitting. We developed an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline to overcome these challenges at ultra-high field. Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (< 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (< 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans. Several metabolites such as creatine and glutamate showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF obtained from wu-MRSI and GRE showed good agreement with 0 ppm/5.5% bias and +-0.05 ppm/ +- 12.75% limits-of-agreement. Conclusion: High-quality metabolic, QSM, and MWF mapping of the human brain can be obtained simultaneously by ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T with 2 mm isotropic resolution in 12 min. WALINET+ robustly removes water sidebands while preserving metabolite signal, eliminating the need for water suppression and separate water acquisitions.

Motivation: Existing compression methods are predominantly optimized for Rate-Distortion (R-D) and constrained by pixel-level fidelity. There is a need to shift towards optimizing for Rate-Perception to prioritize visual perception during compression.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage framework: distilling the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model into a compact one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD), followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning based on Rate-Perception loss alongside a differentiable codec surrogate.

Result: The proposed method integrates seamlessly with standard codecs and improves visual quality significantly, achieving up to 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS metric on the Kodak dataset.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that adapting large-scale generative models for compression preprocessing can yield superior R-P optimization, enhancing texture reproduction and reducing artifacts while outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: Preprocessing is a well-established technique for optimizing compression, yet existing methods are predominantly Rate-Distortion (R-D) optimized and constrained by pixel-level fidelity. This work pioneers a shift towards Rate-Perception (R-P) optimization by, for the first time, adapting a large-scale pre-trained diffusion model for compression preprocessing. We propose a two-stage framework: first, we distill the multi-step Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a compact, one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD). Second, we perform a parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the distilled model's attention modules, guided by a Rate-Perception loss and a differentiable codec surrogate. Our method seamlessly integrates with standard codecs without any modification and leverages the model's powerful generative priors to enhance texture and mitigate artifacts. Experiments show substantial R-P gains, achieving up to a 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS on the Kodak dataset and delivering superior subjective visual quality.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of updating clustering solutions (specifically $k$-center) while minimizing changes from prior solutions, presenting new algorithms and examining their performance on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data solutions often require iterative refinement with minimal disruptions to prior consistency. This motivates the need for methodologies that ensure gradual, smooth updates, especially in clustering contexts.

Method: The authors introduced two constant-factor approximation algorithms tailored to the label-consistent $k$-center problem, balancing solution quality while restricting changes from previous clustering configurations.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieved theoretical guarantees and showed practical effectiveness when evaluated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The research offers novel algorithms to address inconsistency issues in clustering updates, underlining both their theoretical soundness and practical usability in applied settings.

Abstract: Data analysis often involves an iterative process, where solutions must be continuously refined in response to new data. Typically, as new data becomes available, an existing solution must be updated to incorporate the latest information. In addition to seeking a high-quality solution for the task at hand, it is also crucial to ensure consistency by minimizing drastic changes from previous solutions. Applying this approach across many iterations, ensures that the solution evolves gradually and smoothly.
  In this paper, we study the above problem in the context of clustering, specifically focusing on the $k$-center problem. More precisely, we study the following problem: Given a set of points $X$, parameters $k$ and $b$, and a prior clustering solution $H$ for $X$, our goal is to compute a new solution $C$ for $X$, consisting of $k$ centers, which minimizes the clustering cost while introducing at most $b$ changes from $H$. We refer to this problem as label-consistent $k$-center, and we propose two constant-factor approximation algorithms for it. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental evaluation demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: This paper examines the improvement of human-system interfaces (HSIs) in accelerator control systems using human-centered design principles, enhancing usability, safety, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge a gap where human-centered design (HCD) principles, well-established in everyday digital applications, are not adequately applied to safety-critical and complex accelerator control systems, which lag behind modern standards.

Method: The paper explores the application of human-centered design principles by drawing on HF/UX practices and case studies, particularly involving the Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab.

Result: It demonstrates how interfaces rooted in human-centered design principles can manage system complexity while remaining intuitive for a diverse group of users, thereby enhancing holistic operator performance and collaboration.

Conclusion: Integrating HCD principles into accelerator HSIs can evolve them into more effective, user-friendly tools, reducing errors and improving overall system usability and maintainability.

Abstract: Accelerator control systems often represent relatively complex and safety-sensitive human-machine interfaces within process control industries. These systems are technically robust and reflect the cumulative integration of solutions built and adapted across decades. One of the regular, unfortunate casualties of provisional accelerator control system updates is their human-system interfaces (HSIs) which often lag behind modern usability and design standards. An additional challenge is that although there is a multitude of established human factors (HF), and user experience (UX) principles for everyday digital applications, there are very few (if any) established principles for complex and safety-critical applications for an accelerator. This paper argues for the importance of established HF and UX principles (herein referred to as human-centered design principles) into the development of accelerator HSIs, emphasizing the need for clarity, consistency, responsiveness, and cognitive accessibility. Drawing from HF/UX best practices and human-centered design, this paper discusses how these approaches can enhance operator performance, reduce human error, and improve accelerator personnel collaboration. Case studies from Accelerator Control Operations Research Network (ACORN) at Fermilab are explored to demonstrate how interfaces built with human-centered design principles can scale with system complexity while remaining intuitive and efficient for diverse user roles including operators, machine experts, and engineers. By bridging the gap between traditional control system design and modern human-centered design methods, this paper provides a roadmap for evolving accelerator HSIs into more usable, maintainable, and effective tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable materials development for nuclear fusion by creating intelligent, autonomous systems for demanding environments like the IFMIF-DONES accelerator.

Method: Utilizing a Deep Learning Surrogate Model trained on real data to emulate system dynamics and training a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent for pressure control.

Result: The agent effectively maintains precise gas pressure within strict limits, even under dynamic disturbances.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of using advanced AI techniques for autonomous control in complex and demanding systems, paving the way for next-generation accelerator facilities.

Abstract: The development of nuclear fusion requires materials that can withstand extreme conditions. The IFMIF-DONES facility, a high-power particle accelerator, is being designed to qualify these materials. A critical testbed for its development is the MuVacAS prototype, which replicates the final segment of the accelerator beamline. Precise regulation of argon gas pressure within its ultra-high vacuum chamber is vital for this task. This work presents a fully data-driven approach for autonomous pressure control. A Deep Learning Surrogate Model, trained on real operational data, emulates the dynamics of the argon injection system. This high-fidelity digital twin then serves as a fast-simulation environment to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent. The results demonstrate that the agent successfully learns a control policy that maintains gas pressure within strict operational limits despite dynamic disturbances. This approach marks a significant step toward the intelligent, autonomous control systems required for the demanding next-generation particle accelerator facilities.

### [346] [Where to Explore: A Reach and Cost-Aware Approach for Unbiased Data Collection in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14733)
*Qiang Chen,Venkatesh Ganapati Hegde*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to explore content efficiently in remote-first TV environments by strategically placing exploratory content where the risks to engagement are minimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance long-term recommendation quality while facing the challenge of maintaining short-term business performance in remote-first TV setups.

Method: A strategic placement of exploratory content using empirically determined low-cost, high-reach UI positions, tested via A/B experiments.

Result: The approach achieves unbiased interaction data collection, preserves business metrics, and leverages the data to improve downstream recommendation systems.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy offers an effective deployment mechanism for large-scale exploratory content, with both metrics preservation and improved recommendation as outcomes.

Abstract: Exploration is essential to improve long-term recommendation quality, but it often degrades short-term business performance, especially in remote-first TV environments where users engage passively, expect instant relevance, and offer few chances for correction. This paper introduces an approach for delivering content-level exploration safely and efficiently by optimizing its placement based on reach and opportunity cost. Deployed on a large-scale streaming platform with over 100 million monthly active users, our approach identifies scroll-depth regions with lower engagement and strategically introduces a dedicated container, the "Something Completely Different" row containing randomized content. Rather than enforcing exploration uniformly across the user interface (UI), we condition its appearance on empirically low-cost, high-reach positions to ensure minimal tradeoff against platform-level watch time goals. Extensive A/B testing shows that this strategy preserves business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. Our method complements existing intra-row diversification and bandit-based exploration techniques by introducing a deployable, behaviorally informed mechanism for surfacing exploratory content at scale. Moreover, we demonstrate that the collected unbiased data, integrated into downstream candidate generation, significantly improves user engagement, validating its value for recommender systems.

### [347] [Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15372)
*Mikel Williams-Lekuona,Georgina Cosma*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICAR, a method allowing vision transformers to use varying computational resources based on image complexity, optimizing efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers uniformly process all images, leading to inefficiency in analyzing straightforward images with unnecessary computational effort.

Method: ICAR proposes an adaptive processing approach where simpler images use less computation, achieved via dual-path training to ensure compatibility between embeddings from reduced and full compute paths. A complexity classifier, ConvNeXt-IC, predicts the necessary computational depth.

Result: ICAR achieves a 20% practical speedup, maintains category-level performance, and retains 95% instance-level performance. ConvNeXt-IC shows high correlation (0.959) with human judgment and provides a 4.4x speed increase.

Conclusion: ICAR effectively balances computational efficiency and accuracy in vision-language models, promoting sustainable scaling without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The research introduces a robust recommendation system integrating BERT and CNN with neural collaborative filtering (NCF) to improve user interaction by leveraging various data types like numeric, categorical, and image data. The model demonstrated superior performance over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance user engagement on websites by creating a powerful recommendation system tailored to user preferences, utilizing diverse data types.

Method: The authors proposed a model combining BERT and CNN within an NCF framework. It extracted latent features from numeric, categorical, and image data from the MovieLens dataset and was trained for 25 epochs. Its performance was compared to baseline NCF and BERT-based NCF models.

Result: The model achieved superior performance with a 0.72 recall and a 0.486 Hit Ratio @ 10 on 799 users of the MovieLens dataset, outperforming the baseline models.

Conclusion: Incorporating both categorical and image data leads to enhanced recommendation system performance, as demonstrated by the proposed method.

Abstract: Every day, a significant number of users visit the internet for different needs. The owners of a website generate profits from the user interaction with the contents or items of the website. A robust recommendation system can increase user interaction with a website by recommending items according to the user's unique preferences. BERT and CNN-integrated neural collaborative filtering (NCF) have been proposed for the recommendation system in this experiment. The proposed model takes inputs from the user and item profile and finds the user's interest. This model can handle numeric, categorical, and image data to extract the latent features from the inputs. The model is trained and validated on a small sample of the MovieLens dataset for 25 epochs. The same dataset has been used to train and validate a simple NCF and a BERT-based NCF model and compared with the proposed model. The proposed model outperformed those two baseline models. The obtained result for the proposed model is 0.72 recall and 0.486 Hit Ratio @ 10 for 799 users on the MovieLens dataset. This experiment concludes that considering both categorical and image data can improve the performance of a recommendation system.

### [349] [QoS-Aware Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Joint Link Selection and Trajectory Optimization in SAGIN-Supported UAV Mobility Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15119)
*Jiayang Wan,Ke He,Yafei Wang,Fan Liu,Wenjin Wang,Shi Jin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper addresses UAV mobility management in SAGIN through a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning approach, optimizing link selection and trajectory under constraints to improve connectivity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure continuous, reliable coverage for UAVs despite challenges in altitude and mobility, leveraging the SAGIN architecture is critical to achieve seamless connectivity and resolve disparities in heterogeneous networks.

Method: The paper formulates UAV mobility management as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem and proposes a two-level hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework. It incorporates DDQN for link selection and constrained SAC for trajectory optimization with QoS handling.

Result: Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to benchmarks, notably in terms of throughput, link stability, and QoS adherence.

Conclusion: The hierarchical reinforcement learning approach effectively enhances UAV connectivity within SAGIN, supporting reliable and efficient operations under varying mobility challenges and network conditions.

Abstract: Due to the significant variations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) altitude and horizontal mobility, it becomes difficult for any single network to ensure continuous and reliable threedimensional coverage. Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.

### [350] [Photonics-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15549)
*Yuan Wang,Oleksandr Kyriienko*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a hybrid approach combining photonic positional embeddings with graph ML models, achieving superior performance in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate photonics with conventional hardware for efficient machine learning, specifically enhancing graph ML tasks using optical elements for improved performance and acceleration.

Method: The paper proposes a method that leverages photonic positional embeddings obtained via light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices and integrates these embeddings into graph convolutional networks.

Result: The method outperformed baseline GCNs on molecular datasets, reducing mean absolute error by 6.3% for regression and increasing average precision by 2.3% for classification.

Conclusion: Photonics-based positional embeddings enhance GCN performance and enable faster feature generation, supporting the use of optical systems for improving graph machine learning.

Abstract: Photonics can offer a hardware-native route for machine learning (ML). However, efficient deployment of photonics-enhanced ML requires hybrid workflows that integrate optical processing with conventional CPU/GPU based neural network architectures. Here, we propose such a workflow that combines photonic positional embeddings (PEs) with advanced graph ML models. We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML.

### [351] [Graph Pattern-based Association Rules Evaluated Under No-repeated-anything Semantics in the Graph Transactional Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15308)
*Basil Ell*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper introduces Graph Pattern-Based Association Rules (GPARs) for directed labeled multigraphs, offering advanced evaluation and generation tasks with probabilistic assessment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like graph functional dependencies and associated rules are limited in their ability to capture graph topology and advanced pattern assessments in directed labeled multigraphs.

Method: The authors propose GPARs, using no-repeated-anything semantics for pattern evaluation, and define a probabilistic framework to compute metrics like confidence and lift, ensuring their behavior aligns with classical counterparts under specific conditions.

Result: The framework provides a deeper assessment of graph tasks through probabilistic metrics, making it suitable for tasks that require understanding graph structure and associations.

Conclusion: GPARs advance the formalism for graph-based rule analysis, surpassing existing methods in handling graph topology effectively and enabling both evaluative and generative graph tasks.

Abstract: We introduce graph pattern-based association rules (GPARs) for directed labeled multigraphs such as RDF graphs. GPARs support both generative tasks, where a graph is extended, and evaluative tasks, where the plausibility of a graph is assessed. The framework goes beyond related formalisms such as graph functional dependencies, graph entity dependencies, relational association rules, graph association rules, multi-relation and path association rules, and Horn rules. Given a collection of graphs, we evaluate graph patterns under no-repeated-anything semantics, which allows the topology of a graph to be taken into account more effectively. We define a probability space and derive confidence, lift, leverage, and conviction in a probabilistic setting. We further analyze how these metrics relate to their classical itemset-based counterparts and identify conditions under which their characteristic properties are preserved.

### [352] [A Statistical Framework for Spatial Boundary Estimation and Change Detection: Application to the Sahel Sahara Climate Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15650)
*Stephen Tivenan,Indranil Sahoo,Yanjun Qian*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to estimate spatial boundaries and test their temporal shifts using heteroskedastic Gaussian process regression combined with statistical hypothesis testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of quantifying uncertainty and temporal shifts in spatial boundary locations, especially derived from noisy environmental data, as such boundaries signal environmental changes.

Method: The framework uses heteroskedastic Gaussian process (GP) regression for probabilistic reconstruction and the Maximum Absolute Difference Global Envelope Test for hypothesis testing on boundary shifts.

Result: Simulation studies validated the method's accuracy. Applied to the Sahel-Sahara transition zone, significant localized boundary shifts were identified during drought years though no decade-scale changes were detected.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies temporal and localized boundary shifts, enhancing the understanding of environmental boundary behaviors under changing conditions.

Abstract: Spatial boundaries, such as ecological transitions or climatic regime interfaces, capture steep environmental gradients, and shifts in their structure can signal emerging environmental changes. Quantifying uncertainty in spatial boundary locations and formally testing for temporal shifts remains challenging, especially when boundaries are derived from noisy, gridded environmental data. We present a unified framework that combines heteroskedastic Gaussian process (GP) regression with a scaled Maximum Absolute Difference (MAD) Global Envelope Test (GET) to estimate spatial boundary curves and assess whether they evolve over time. The heteroskedastic GP provides a flexible probabilistic reconstruction of boundary lines, capturing spatially varying mean structure and location specific variability, while the test offers a rigorous hypothesis testing tool for detecting departures from expected boundary behaviors. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves the correct size under the null and high power for detecting local boundary shifts. Applying our framework to the Sahel Sahara transition zone, using annual Koppen Trewartha climate classifications from 1960 to 1989, we find no statistically significant decade scale changes in the arid and semi arid or semi arid and non arid interfaces. However, the method successfully identifies localized boundary shifts during the extreme drought years of 1983 and 1984, consistent with climate studies documenting regional anomalies in these interfaces during that period.

*Jaume Anguera Peris,Songtao Cheng,Hanzhao Zhang,Wei Ouyang,Joakim Jaldén*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The study presents the Restless Multi-Process Multi-Armed Bandit (RMPMAB), a framework for optimizing live-cell imaging processes by addressing the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of biological systems, resulting in significant improvements in resource efficiency and capturing critical events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the inefficiency and limitations in balancing time, computational resources, and photobleaching issues during live-cell imaging, which are compounded by dynamic biological processes and traditional static sampling approaches.

Method: The researchers used the RMPMAB framework, modeling experimental regions as ensembles of Markov chains to account for biological dynamics. They derived behaviors for aggregated processes, developed scalable Whittle index policies, and tested the approach through simulations and biological imaging data.

Result: RMPMAB reduced cumulative regret by over 37% in simulations and captured 93% more relevant biological events during live imaging experiments, outperforming existing methodologies like Thomson Sampling and Bayesian UCB.

Conclusion: The RMPMAB framework enables smarter microscopy by optimizing imaging resource allocation under constraints, unifying decision theory with imaging control, and aiding scientific discovery.

Abstract: High-content screening microscopy generates large amounts of live-cell imaging data, yet its potential remains constrained by the inability to determine when and where to image most effectively. Optimally balancing acquisition time, computational capacity, and photobleaching budgets across thousands of dynamically evolving regions of interest remains an open challenge, further complicated by limited field-of-view adjustments and sensor sensitivity. Existing approaches either rely on static sampling or heuristics that neglect the dynamic evolution of biological processes, leading to inefficiencies and missed events. Here, we introduce the restless multi-process multi-armed bandit (RMPMAB), a new decision-theoretic framework in which each experimental region is modeled not as a single process but as an ensemble of Markov chains, thereby capturing the inherent heterogeneity of biological systems such as asynchronous cell cycles and heterogeneous drug responses. Building upon this foundation, we derive closed-form expressions for transient and asymptotic behaviors of aggregated processes, and design scalable Whittle index policies with sub-linear complexity in the number of imaging regions. Through both simulations and a real biological live-cell imaging dataset, we show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in throughput under resource constraints. Notably, our algorithm outperforms Thomson Sampling, Bayesian UCB, epsilon-Greedy, and Round Robin by reducing cumulative regret by more than 37% in simulations and capturing 93% more biologically relevant events in live imaging experiments, underscoring its potential for transformative smart microscopy. Beyond improving experimental efficiency, the RMPMAB framework unifies stochastic decision theory with optimal autonomous microscopy control, offering a principled approach to accelerate discovery across multidisciplinary sciences.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: End-to-end spoken dialogue systems are evaluated for multi-turn audio interactions through a new benchmark, Audio MultiChallenge, incorporating audio-specific challenges and realistic conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks primarily focus on synthetic speech and single-turn dialogues, neglecting realistic multi-turn interactions and challenges in end-to-end spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Introduced Audio MultiChallenge, a benchmark extending MultiChallenge by adding audio-specific axes like Voice Editing and Audio-Cue challenges, using curated unscripted conversations and new evaluation rubrics.

Result: Evaluations showed frontier models struggle with the benchmark's new challenges, achieving a highest pass rate of 54.65% while facing issues with tracking edits, audio cues, and long-range context.

Conclusion: Audio MultiChallenge provides a robust framework for understanding limitations in dialogue systems and drives progress in natural multi-turn spoken dialogue capabilities.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems are increasingly replacing cascaded pipelines for voice-based human-AI interaction, processing raw audio directly without intermediate transcription. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate these models on synthetic speech and single-turn tasks, leaving realistic multi-turn conversational ability underexplored. We introduce Audio MultiChallenge, an open-source benchmark to evaluate E2E spoken dialogue systems under natural multi-turn interaction patterns. Building on the text-based MultiChallenge framework, which evaluates Inference Memory, Instruction Retention, and Self Coherence, we introduce a new axis Voice Editing that tests robustness to mid-utterance speech repairs and backtracking. We further augment each axis to the audio modality, such as introducing Audio-Cue challenges for Inference Memory that require recalling ambient sounds and paralinguistic signals beyond semantic content. We curate 452 conversations from 47 speakers with 1,712 instance-specific rubrics through a hybrid audio-native agentic and human-in-the-loop pipeline that exposes model failures at scale while preserving natural disfluencies found in unscripted human speech. Our evaluation of proprietary and open-source models reveals that even frontier models struggle on our benchmark, with Gemini 3 Pro Preview (Thinking), our highest-performing model achieving a 54.65% pass rate. Error analysis shows that models fail most often on our new axes and that Self Coherence degrades with longer audio context. These failures reflect difficulty of tracking edits, audio cues, and long-range context in natural spoken dialogue. Audio MultiChallenge provides a reproducible testbed to quantify them and drive improvements in audio-native multi-turn interaction capability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The risk of environmental sound manipulation due to advances in audio generation creates a need for robust detection methods.

Method: BEAT2AASIST uses extended BEATs-derived features distributed via dual AASIST branches, enhanced with transformer layer fusion and data augmentation strategies.

Result: The proposed BEAT2AASIST approach achieves competitive results across challenge tracks in the ESDD 2026 Challenge.

Conclusion: BEAT2AASIST demonstrates effective solutions for deepfake detection in environmental sounds, paving the way for future advancements in audio forensics.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation have increased the risk of realistic environmental sound manipulation, motivating the ESDD 2026 Challenge as the first large-scale benchmark for Environmental Sound Deepfake Detection (ESDD). We propose BEAT2AASIST which extends BEATs-AASIST by splitting BEATs-derived representations along frequency or channel dimension and processing them with dual AASIST branches. To enrich feature representations, we incorporate top-k transformer layer fusion using concatenation, CNN-gated, and SE-gated strategies. In addition, vocoder-based data augmentation is applied to improve robustness against unseen spoofing methods. Experimental results on the official test sets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance across the challenge tracks.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents a GAN framework for modeling time-varying audio effects using input-output audio, eliminating the need for extracting modulation signals. Testing on a vintage hardware phaser shows promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of black-box modeling for time-varying audio systems, where internal modulation signals are hard to record or extract, making conventional approaches impractical.

Method: The authors propose a GAN framework with a convolutional-recurrent architecture trained in two phases: adversarial training to learn modulation behavior distributions, and supervised fine-tuning with a State Prediction Network for synchronization.

Result: The method successfully models time-varying dynamics of a vintage hardware phaser in a black-box setting.

Conclusion: This approach enables accurate modeling of time-varying audio effects without requiring internal modulation signal extraction, advancing black-box modeling methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a standard approach for the modeling of audio effects, yet strictly black-box modeling remains problematic for time-varying systems. Unlike time-invariant effects, training models on devices with internal modulation typically requires the recording or extraction of control signals to ensure the time-alignment required by standard loss functions. This paper introduces a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to model such effects using only input-output audio recordings, removing the need for modulation signal extraction. We propose a convolutional-recurrent architecture trained via a two-stage strategy: an initial adversarial phase allows the model to learn the distribution of the modulation behavior without strict phase constraints, followed by a supervised fine-tuning phase where a State Prediction Network (SPN) estimates the initial internal states required to synchronize the model with the target. Additionally, a new objective metric based on chirp-train signals is developed to quantify modulation accuracy. Experiments modeling a vintage hardware phaser demonstrate the method's ability to capture time-varying dynamics in a fully black-box context.

*Ken O'Hanlon,Basil Woods,Lin Wang,Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces QSCNet, a conditioned UNet for Music Source Separation (MSS), demonstrating superior performance over previous methods with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of traditional MSS methods using multi-output neural networks by proposing a conditioned approach to handle a broader range of stem queries without relying on a strict instrument vocabulary.

Method: The authors propose and design QSCNet based on Sparse Compressed Networks as a conditioned UNet for MSS, challenging the assumption that UNets are unsuitable for conditioned MSS tasks.

Result: QSCNet outperformed the Banquet method by over 1dB SNR in MSS tasks, while requiring less than half the parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed QSCNet effectively enhances MSS tasks, offering improved performance, flexibility in handling vocabularies, and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a conditioned UNet for Music Source Separation (MSS). MSS is generally performed by multi-output neural networks, typically UNets, with each output representing a particular stem from a predefined instrument vocabulary. In contrast, conditioned MSS networks accept an audio query related to a stem of interest alongside the signal from which that stem is to be extracted. Thus, a strict vocabulary is not required and this enables more realistic tasks in MSS. The potential of conditioned approaches for such tasks has been somewhat hidden due to a lack of suitable data, an issue recently addressed with the MoisesDb dataset. A recent method, Banquet, employs this dataset with promising results seen on larger vocabularies. Banquet uses Bandsplit RNN rather than a UNet and the authors state that UNets should not be suitable for conditioned MSS. We counter this argument and propose QSCNet, a novel conditioned UNet for MSS that integrates network conditioning elements in the Sparse Compressed Network for MSS. We find QSCNet to outperform Banquet by over 1dB SNR on a couple of MSS tasks, while using less than half the number of parameters.

TL;DR: This paper integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with concrete design to improve prediction accuracy using multi-modal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited database size and diversity in cementitious material research challenge the performance of machine learning applications.

Method: Graph Neural Networks are employed using numerical and graphical data converted into graph representation via the k-nearest neighbor approach.

Result: GNN demonstrated prediction performance equivalent to random forests, which are reliable in cement-related predictions.

Conclusion: The study establishes a roadmap for adopting advanced AI architectures, paving the way for multi-modal, physics-informed GNN models in concrete research.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly applied in concrete research to optimize performance and mixture design. However, one major challenge in applying ML to cementitious materials is the limited size and diversity of available databases. A promising solution is the development of multi-modal databases that integrate both numerical and graphical data. Conventional ML frameworks in cement research are typically restricted to a single data modality. Graph neural network (GNN) represents a new generation of neural architectures capable of learning from data structured as graphs, capturing relationships through irregular or topology-dependent connections rather than fixed spatial coordinates. While GNN is inherently designed for graphical data, they can be adapted to extract correlations from numerical datasets and potentially embed physical laws directly into their architecture, enabling explainable and physics-informed predictions. This work is among the first few studies to implement GNNs to design concrete, with a particular emphasis on establishing a clear and reproducible pathway for converting tabular data into graph representations using the k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach. Model hyperparameters and feature selection are systematically optimized to enhance prediction performance. The GNN shows performance comparable to the benchmark random forest, which has been demonstrated by many studies to yield reliable predictions for cementitious materials. Overall, this study provides a foundational roadmap for transitioning from traditional ML to advanced AI architectures. The proposed framework establishes a strong foundation for future multi-modal and physics-informed GNN models capable of capturing complex material behaviors and accelerating the design and optimization of cementitious materials.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces HD-Prot, a hybrid diffusion protein language model that simultaneously integrates protein sequence and structural information using continuous tokens without discretizing protein structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of integrating continuous protein structural knowledge into protein language models (pLMs) without losing fine-grained information due to discretization.

Method: HD-Prot embeds a continuous-valued diffusion component into a sequence-based pLM, enabling it to handle both discrete and continuous data simultaneously for combined sequence-structure modeling.

Result: The model performs competitively with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs in tasks like protein structure prediction and motif-scaffolding using limited computational resources.

Conclusion: HD-Prot demonstrates the feasibility of unifying categorical (sequence) and continuous (structure) data within a single pLM, offering a new approach for developing multimodal protein models.

Abstract: Proteins inherently possess a consistent sequence-structure duality. The abundance of protein sequence data, which can be readily represented as discrete tokens, has driven fruitful developments in protein language models (pLMs). A key remaining challenge, however, is how to effectively integrate continuous structural knowledge into pLMs. Current methods often discretize protein structures to accommodate the language modeling framework, which inevitably results in the loss of fine-grained information and limits the performance potential of multimodal pLMs. In this paper, we argue that such concerns can be circumvented: a sequence-based pLM can be extended to incorporate the structure modality through continuous tokens, i.e., high-fidelity protein structure latents that avoid vector quantization. Specifically, we propose a hybrid diffusion protein language model, HD-Prot, which embeds a continuous-valued diffusion head atop a discrete pLM, enabling seamless operation with both discrete and continuous tokens for joint sequence-structure modeling. It captures inter-token dependencies across modalities through a unified absorbing diffusion process, and estimates per-token distributions via categorical prediction for sequences and continuous diffusion for structures. Extensive empirical results show that HD-Prot achieves competitive performance in unconditional sequence-structure co-generation, motif-scaffolding, protein structure prediction, and inverse folding tasks, performing on par with state-of-the-art multimodal pLMs despite being developed under limited computational resources. It highlights the viability of simultaneously estimating categorical and continuous distributions within a unified language model architecture, offering a promising alternative direction for multimodal pLMs.

Conclusion: This solution effectively addresses machine vision system requirements and is adaptable to real-world applications.

Abstract: There has been a growing trend in compressing and transmitting videos from terminals for machine vision tasks. Nevertheless, most video coding optimization method focus on minimizing distortion according to human perceptual metrics, overlooking the heightened demands posed by machine vision systems. In this paper, we propose a video preprocessing framework tailored for machine vision tasks to address this challenge. The proposed method incorporates a neural preprocessor which retaining crucial information for subsequent tasks, resulting in the boosting of rate-accuracy performance. We further introduce a differentiable virtual codec to provide constraints on rate and distortion during the training stage. We directly apply widely used standard codecs for testing. Therefore, our solution can be easily applied to real-world scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments evaluating our compression method on two typical downstream tasks with various backbone networks. The experimental results indicate that our approach can save over 15% of bitrate compared to using only the standard codec anchor version.

### [361] [PyFi: Toward Pyramid-like Financial Image Understanding for VLMs via Adversarial Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14735)
*Yuqun Zhang,Yuxuan Zhao,Sijia Chen*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyFi, a framework for financial image understanding using a progressive reasoning approach in vision language models (VLMs), supported by a dataset of 600K synthesized financial question-answer pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial visual data requires advanced reasoning with both basic perception and specialized expertise. Effective tools to evaluate and improve vision-language models (VLMs) in such expertise-based domains are lacking.

Method: The authors designed PyFi, consisting of PyFi-600K, a high-quality synthesized dataset based on adversarial agents and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and fine-tuned VLMs for hierarchical financial question answering.

Result: Fine-tuned models on PyFi showed significant accuracy improvements on complex financial questions, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B models demonstrating 19.52% and 8.06% higher average accuracy, respectively.

Conclusion: PyFi demonstrates effective progression-driven reasoning for VLMs in financial domains, providing valuable resources for future research and applications in financial image understanding.

Abstract: This paper proposes PyFi, a novel framework for pyramid-like financial image understanding that enables vision language models (VLMs) to reason through question chains in a progressive, simple-to-complex manner. At the core of PyFi is PyFi-600K, a dataset comprising 600K financial question-answer pairs organized into a reasoning pyramid: questions at the base require only basic perception, while those toward the apex demand increasing levels of capability in financial visual understanding and expertise. This data is scalable because it is synthesized without human annotations, using PyFi-adv, a multi-agent adversarial mechanism under the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm, in which, for each image, a challenger agent competes with a solver agent by generating question chains that progressively probe deeper capability levels in financial visual reasoning. Leveraging this dataset, we present fine-grained, hierarchical, and comprehensive evaluations of advanced VLMs in the financial domain. Moreover, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the pyramid-structured question chains enables these models to answer complex financial questions by decomposing them into sub-questions with gradually increasing reasoning demands, yielding average accuracy improvements of 19.52% and 8.06%, respectively, on the dataset.

*Adewale Akinfaderin,Shreyas Subramanian*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: VERAFI improves factual correctness in financial AI to 94.7%, addressing blind spots in reasoning and regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial AI systems excel in document retrieval but struggle with reasoning errors like calculations and regulatory violations.

Method: VERAFI uses dense retrieval, cross-encoder reranking, financial tool-equipped agents, and neurosymbolic policies.

Result: In FinanceBench evaluation, VERAFI achieved 94.7% factual correctness, outperforming traditional methods at 52.4%.

Conclusion: VERAFI enables trustworthy financial AI by integrating domain expertise for improved reasoning accuracy and compliance.

Abstract: Financial AI systems suffer from a critical blind spot: while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at finding relevant documents, language models still generate calculation errors and regulatory violations during reasoning, even with perfect retrieval. This paper introduces VERAFI (Verified Agentic Financial Intelligence), an agentic framework with neurosymbolic policy generation for verified financial intelligence. VERAFI combines state-of-the-art dense retrieval and cross-encoder reranking with financial tool-enabled agents and automated reasoning policies covering GAAP compliance, SEC requirements, and mathematical validation. Our comprehensive evaluation on FinanceBench demonstrates remarkable improvements: while traditional dense retrieval with reranking achieves only 52.4\% factual correctness, VERAFI's integrated approach reaches 94.7\%, an 81\% relative improvement. The neurosymbolic policy layer alone contributes a 4.3 percentage point gain over pure agentic processing, specifically targeting persistent mathematical and logical errors. By integrating financial domain expertise directly into the reasoning process, VERAFI offers a practical pathway toward trustworthy financial AI that meets the stringent accuracy demands of regulatory compliance, investment decisions, and risk management.

### [363] [Adaptive Weighted Genetic Algorithm-Optimized SVR for Robust Long-Term Forecasting of Global Stock Indices for investment decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15113)
*Mohit Beniwal*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IGA-SVR model designed for long-term price prediction, showing significant improvements over LSTM and OGA-SVR in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of long-term price forecasting for global indices due to high uncertainty, which is critical for investors and traders.

Method: An improved genetic algorithm-optimized support vector regression (IGA-SVR) model was developed, leveraging genetic algorithms for hyperparameter optimization and training strategies to capture both recent and long-term trends.

Result: The IGA-SVR model outperformed LSTM and OGA-SVR, reducing MAPE by 19.87% and 50.03% respectively, while being computationally more efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed IGA-SVR model is both highly accurate and efficient, making it suitable for long-term price forecasting by balancing long-term trends and recent data.

Abstract: Long-term price forecasting remains a formidable challenge due to the inherent uncertainty over the long term, despite some success in short-term predictions. Nonetheless, accurate long-term forecasts are essential for high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and traders. The proposed improved genetic algorithm-optimized support vector regression (IGA-SVR) model is specifically designed for long-term price prediction of global indices. The performance of the IGA-SVR model is rigorously evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the forward-validating genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression (OGA-SVR). Extensive testing was conducted on the five global indices, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), DAX Performance Index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (N225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) from 2021 to 2024 of daily price prediction up to a year. Overall, the proposed IGA-SVR model achieved a reduction in MAPE by 19.87% compared to LSTM and 50.03% compared to OGA-SVR, demonstrating its superior performance in long-term daily price forecasting of global indices. Further, the execution time for LSTM was approximately 20 times higher than that of IGA-SVR, highlighting the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model. The genetic algorithm selects the optimal hyperparameters of SVR by minimizing the arithmetic mean of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) calculated over the full training dataset and the most recent five years of training data. This purposefully designed training methodology adjusts for recent trends while retaining long-term trend information, thereby offering enhanced generalization compared to the LSTM and rolling-forward validation approach employed by OGA-SVR, which forgets long-term trends and suffers from recency bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connectivity challenges hinder the efficiency and widespread implementation of advanced agricultural systems powered by sensors.

Method: The paper implements a Gradient-Based Iteration with Lagrange method alongside a hybrid sensor coverage approach for optimizing sensor deployment.

Result: The proposed solution improves sensor coverage (98.5% compared to 95% for traditional methods), decreases the required number of sensors, and reduces costs and power consumption.

Conclusion: The innovative sensor distribution method enhances agricultural system efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while outperforming traditional deployment techniques.

Abstract: The innovative agriculture system is revolutionizing how we farm, making it one of the most critical innovations of our time! Yet it faces significant connectivity challenges, particularly with the sensors that power this technology. An efficient sensor deployment solution is still required to maximize the network's detection capabilities and efficiency while minimizing resource consumption and operational costs. This paper introduces an innovative sensor allocation optimization method that employs a Gradient-Based Iteration with Lagrange. The proposed method enhances coverage by utilizing a hybrid approach while minimizing the number of sensor nodes required under grid-based allocation. The proposed sensor distribution outperformed the classic deterministic deployment across coverage, number of sensors, cost, and power consumption. Furthermore, scalability is enhanced by extending sensing coverage to the remaining area via Bluetooth, which has a shorter communication range. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieved 98.5% wireless sensor coverage, compared with 95% for the particle swarm distribution.

### [365] [EVICPRESS: Joint KV-Cache Compression and Eviction for Efficient LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14946)
*Shaoting Feng,Yuhan Liu,Hanchen Li,Xiaokun Chen,Samuel Shen,Kuntai Du,Zhuohan Gu,Rui Zhang,Yuyang Huang,Yihua Cheng,Jiayi Yao,Qizheng Zhang,Ganesh Ananthanarayanan,Junchen Jiang*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper proposes EVICPRESS, a system for optimizing storage decisions for KV cache in LLM inference by combining eviction and compression strategies to enhance speed without sacrificing generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient KV cache management in Large Language Model inference systems arises due to increasing users and memory constraints, which prior methods fail to optimize across eviction and compression decisions holistically.

Method: EVICPRESS uses a unified utility function that evaluates the impact of eviction/compression on both quality and latency. It updates configurations with profiling and employs heuristic methods to decide KV cache placement across storage tiers.

Result: EVICPRESS improves KV cache hit rates on fast storage, reduces average delay, and preserves high generation quality by cautious compression strategies, outperforming baseline methods in TTFT by up to 2.19x.

Conclusion: EVICPRESS delivers a comprehensive approach to KV cache management, achieving significant latency improvements without compromising LLM generation quality across multiple datasets and models.

Abstract: Reusing KV cache is essential for high efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems. With more LLM users, the KV cache footprint can easily exceed GPU memory capacity, so prior work has proposed to either evict KV cache to lower-tier storage devices, or compress KV cache so that more KV cache can be fit in the fast memory. However, prior work misses an important opportunity: jointly optimizing the eviction and compression decisions across all KV caches to minimize average generation latency without hurting quality.
  We propose EVICPRESS, a KV-cache management system that applies lossy compression and adaptive eviction to KV cache across multiple storage tiers. Specifically, for each KV cache of a context, EVICPRESS considers the effect of compression and eviction of the KV cache on the average generation quality and delay across all contexts as a whole. To achieve this, EVICPRESS proposes a unified utility function that quantifies the effect of quality and delay of the lossy compression or eviction. To this end, EVICPRESS's profiling module periodically updates the utility function scores on all possible eviction-compression configurations for all contexts and places KV caches using a fast heuristic to rearrange KV caches on all storage tiers, with the goal of maximizing the utility function scores on each storage tier. Compared to the baselines that evict KV cache or compress KV cache, EVICPRESS achieves higher KV-cache hit rates on fast devices, i.e., lower delay, while preserving high generation quality by applying conservative compression to contexts that are sensitive to compression errors. Evaluation on 12 datasets and 5 models demonstrates that EVICPRESS achieves up to 2.19x faster time-to-first-token (TTFT) at equivalent generation quality.
