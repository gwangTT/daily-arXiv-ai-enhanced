### [1] [Mirror-Neuron Patterns in AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01885)
*Robyn Wyrick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether artificial neural networks can develop mirror-neuron-like patterns, potentially aiding in intrinsic alignment with human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the necessity of aligning superintelligent AI systems with human values, particularly since top-down control methods might not suffice.

Method: The study utilizes a novel Frog and Toad game framework to promote cooperative behaviors and investigates the emergence of mirror-neuron patterns in ANNs.

Result: ANNs can develop empathy-like, cooperative behaviors through shared representations under specific conditions, measured by the introduced Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI).

Conclusion: Embedding mirror-neuron-like dynamics within AI architectures could enhance alignment by fostering intrinsic empathy and cooperation.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

### [2] [Human-AI Co-Embodied Intelligence for Scientific Experimentation and Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02071)
*Xinyi Lin,Yuyang Zhang,Yuanhang Gan,Juntao Chen,Hao Shen,Yichun He,Lijun Li,Ze Yuan,Shuang Wang,Chaohao Wang,Rui Zhang,Na Li,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a human-AI co-embodied intelligence system combining humans, agentic AI, and wearable technology for physical execution and adaptive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliance on human expertise in physical domains, which limits reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility in scientific and manufacturing workflows.

Method: The study integrates human precision with AI capabilities like memory, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback, enabled by wearable hardware and demonstrated through the APEX system in electronics fabrication.

Result: The APEX system demonstrated context-aware reasoning, error correction, real-time feedback, and skill transfer to beginners with superior accuracy compared to multimodal large language models.

Conclusion: The research establishes a novel hybrid intelligence paradigm that bridges computational reasoning with physical execution, enhancing autonomy, scalability, and traceability in experimental and manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

### [3] [Automated Reward Design for Gran Turismo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02094)
*Michel Ma,Takuma Seno,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter R. Wurman,Peter Stone,Craig Sherstan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores automated reward design for RL agents using foundation models in complex environments like Gran Turismo 7 racing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping desired behaviors to reward functions in reinforcement learning for complex environments is challenging.

Method: Integrating LLMs for reward generation, VLMs for preference-based evaluation, and human feedback to design competitive RL agents.

Result: The system produced agents that compete with champion-level RL agents like GT Sophy and exhibit novel behaviors.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of automated reward design using foundation models, highlighting its practical applications in complex scenarios.

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

### [4] [Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep values or Shallow Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02109)
*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), a framework to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) capture fundamental human values versus shallow preferences, showing poor generalization of deep values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and ensure that LLMs learn and generalize core human values (such as moral principles) instead of only surface-level preferences, which is crucial for AI alignment.

Method: The authors developed an experimental framework where deep human values and shallow features were correlated in training but intentionally decoupled in testing. They measured the Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) to check if models generalize based on values or superficial traits.

Result: The average DVGR across 9 models was 0.30, showing models generalize deep values less than chance. Larger models performed slightly worse than smaller ones.

Conclusion: Current LLMs fail to robustly generalize deep human values, highlighting a significant challenge for AI alignment. The authors provide a novel dataset and framework for further exploration.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

### [5] [InsurAgent: A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Simulating Individual Behavior in Purchasing Flood Insurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02119)
*Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Dan M. Frangopol,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces InsurAgent, a model leveraging large language models and retrieval techniques to simulate and improve insurance decision-making predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Participation rates in flood insurance among at-risk populations in the US remain low, highlighting the need to better understand behavioral factors influencing insurance decisions.

Method: The study constructs a benchmark dataset to analyze insurance purchase probabilities using various factors. InsurAgent, an LLM-powered agent with modules like perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, aims to enhance decision-making predictions.

Result: InsurAgent utilizes empirical data through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for improved accuracy and leverages LLMs for contextual and temporal insights. It successfully predicts probabilities more effectively than standard LLMs.

Conclusion: InsurAgent demonstrates advancements in behavioral modeling, offering promising tools for understanding insurance decisions and aiding policy-making.

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

### [6] [Re-FORC: Adaptive Reward Prediction for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02130)
*Renos Zabounidis,Aditya Golatkar,Michael Kleinman,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Re-FORC is an efficient reward prediction method enabling dynamic reasoning via adaptive control over reasoning length to optimize computation and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for efficient reasoning processes that balance computational cost and model performance. Current systems lack adaptive mechanisms to optimize reasoning length and model selection.

Method: Re-FORC uses a lightweight adapter trained on reasoning models. It predicts expected future rewards based on context and the number of future reasoning tokens. This enables dynamic control over reasoning processes.

Result: Re-FORC achieves: 1) 26% compute reduction via early stopping while maintaining accuracy, 2) 4% accuracy improvement at similar compute and 55% compute reduction at equivalent accuracy, and 3) 7%-11% improved accuracy under adaptive test-time scaling.

Conclusion: Re-FORC presents a novel approach to enable adaptive reasoning by optimizing trade-offs between computation and performance. This fosters efficient, dynamic decision-making in reasoning models.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

### [7] [Personalized Decision Modeling: Utility Optimization or Textualized-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02194)
*Yibo Zhao,Yang Zhao,Hongru Du,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATHENA, a model combining symbolic utility discovery and semantic adaptation to enhance individual decision-making models, outperforming cutting-edge approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between individual decision-making processes and population-level optimal predictions, especially in high-stakes scenarios like vaccine uptake.

Method: ATHENA incorporates a two-stage process: symbolic discovery of group-level utility functions using LLMs, and semantic adaptation to create personalized decision-making templates.

Result: ATHENA achieves a substantial improvement in F1 score (at least 6.5%) over existing models in travel mode and vaccine choice prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively integrates symbolic utility modeling with semantic adaptation, offering significant advancements in human-centric decision modeling.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

### [8] [Optimal-Agent-Selection: State-Aware Routing Framework for Efficient Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02200)
*Jingbo Wang,Sendong Zhao,Haochun Wang,Yuzheng Fan,Lizhe Zhang,Yan Liu,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework that optimizes collaboration in multi-agent systems. It achieves improved task performance and reduces data collection overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency in rigid agent scheduling and coordination strategies in multi-agent systems, thereby unlocking the full potential of these systems for complex task-solving.

Method: The paper proposes STRMAC, a framework which uses separate encodings of interaction history and agent knowledge to route tasks to the most suitable agent adaptively. It also incorporates a self-evolving data generation approach to create high-quality training data efficiently.

Result: STRMAC outperforms baselines in collaborative reasoning tasks, achieving up to a 23.8% performance improvement and reducing data collection overhead by up to 90.1%.

Conclusion: STRMAC proves to be an effective and efficient solution for dynamic scheduling and coordination in multi-agent systems, demonstrating its state-of-the-art capabilities in challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

### [9] [Training Proactive and Personalized LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02208)
*Weiwei Sun,Xuhui Zhou,Weihua Du,Xingyao Wang,Sean Welleck,Graham Neubig,Maarten Sap,Yiming Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the necessity of optimizing AI agents in three dimensions: task success, essential questioning, and adaptability to user preferences. It introduces the UserVille framework and PPP multi-objective approach, leading to significant improvements in agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for AI agents that are not only task-efficient but also proactive and personalized in interactions to suit diverse user preferences.

Method: The researchers created UserVille, an interactive environment with user simulators, and developed PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework for optimizing productivity, proactivity, and personalization.

Result: Agents trained using PPP demonstrated substantial improvements over existing models like GPT-5, particularly in strategic questioning, adapting to unseen users, and overall task success (+21.6 on average).

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing user-centered interaction is essential for practical and effective AI agents, as shown by the significant advancements realized through the PPP approach.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

### [10] [TabDSR: Decompose, Sanitize, and Reason for Complex Numerical Reasoning in Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02219)
*Changjiang Jiang,Fengchang Yu,Haihua Chen,Wei Lu,Jin Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework (method) for improving complex reasoning in tabular data using large language models (LLMs), introducing a query decomposer, table sanitizer, and PoT-based reasoner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve LLMs' performance in complex reasoning with tabular data, addressing challenges like noisy data and limited numerical capabilities.

Method: Developed method, comprising a query decomposer for breaking complex queries, a table sanitizer for noise reduction, and PoT-based reasoner for generating executable reasoning code.

Result: Tested on new dataset (CalTab151) and benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy improvements: 8.79% (TAT-QA), 6.08% (TableBench), and 19.87%.

Conclusion: method significantly bolsters LLMs’ capabilities for numerical reasoning over complex tabular data, offering a robust, scalable solution with code and datasets available.

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a
robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing LLM performance for
complex tabular numerical reasoning. Data and code are available upon request.

*Keyu Zhao,Weiquan Lin,Qirui Zheng,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Deep Ideation framework integrating large language models and scientific networks to improve research ideation quality by leveraging contextual relationships between keywords.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of simplistic methods (e.g., keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity) in research ideation, which do not consider complex contextual relationships and lack grounding in established research.

Method: The Deep Ideation framework integrates a scientific network for contextual keyword relationships with a workflow (explore-expand-evolve). It uses an Idea Stack for tracking and a critic engine trained on reviewer feedback to refine ideas based on novelty and feasibility.

Result: The framework improves idea quality by 10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas outperforming acceptance levels of top conferences. Human evaluation shows its practical value in scientific research.

Conclusion: The Deep Ideation framework effectively enhances research ideation using contextual keyword relationships and LLM-driven processes, demonstrating practicality and quality surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

### [12] [When Modalities Conflict: How Unimodal Reasoning Uncertainty Governs Preference Dynamics in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02243)
*Zhuoran Zhang,Tengyue Wang,Xilin Gong,Yang Shi,Haotian Wang,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper offers a framework to analyze how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) resolve conflicts when different input modalities provide contradictory information by leveraging relative uncertainty and inherent modality preference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MLLMs resolve conflicts between contradictory inputs from different modalities, addressing overlooked factors such as a model's confidence in unimodal reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces a framework decomposing modality following into relative reasoning uncertainty (confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent modality preference (bias when uncertainties are balanced). A controlled dataset with varying difficulty levels of visual and textual inputs, along with entropy as an uncertainty metric, is used for analysis.

Result: The study finds that the probability of following a modality decreases as its relative uncertainty increases, defines a 'balance point' where modalities are equally probable, and isolates modality bias from unimodal performance. Layer-wise predictions reveal oscillation mechanisms in ambiguous regions near this balance point.

Conclusion: This framework offers a clearer understanding of how MLLMs resolve conflicting information through the principles of relative uncertainty and inherent modality preference, providing quantitative and mechanistic insights.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

TL;DR: LLMs excel in complex reasoning tasks through multi-agent collaboration but face challenges like lazy agent behavior and noisy responses, which this paper addresses with a causal influence metric and a verifiable reward mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how the multi-agent paradigm using LLMs can achieve better performance in reasoning tasks while addressing collaboration inefficiencies and noisy interactions.

Method: Introduce a theoretical analysis on lazy behavior in multi-agent systems, develop a causal influence measure, and propose a verifiable reward mechanism to enhance agent collaboration and deliberation.

Result: The proposed framework mitigates lazy agent behavior, enhances collaboration, and improves multi-agent performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: By addressing the drawbacks in existing multi-agent frameworks, the proposed methods unlock better collaboration and reasoning in LLM-based systems for complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

*Yohan Lee,DongGyun Kang,SeHoon Park,Sa-Yoon Park,Kwangsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProQ-BERT, a transformer-based framework for accurate CKD progression prediction using multimodal EHR, achieving high predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic Kidney Disease impacts a substantial portion of the population, necessitating accurate prognosis methods for effective intervention and resource allocation.

Method: Using EHRs, ProQ-BERT employs a transformer-based model with quantization-based tokenization and attention mechanisms, pretrained with masked language modeling and fine-tuned for binary classification.

Result: ProQ-BERT outperformed existing models like CEHR-BERT, achieving remarkable predictive metrics (ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989).

Conclusion: Transformer architectures and temporal designs can significantly enhance clinical prognosis modeling, providing better tools for personalized CKD care.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

*Muhammad Sheharyar Liaqat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system to assess breast cancer risk early using clinical and physiological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of breast cancer is vital due to its high global mortality rates, but challenges persist due to disease complexity and patient variability.

Method: The system uses fuzzy soft set theory combining parameters like BMI, insulin, leptin, adiponectin levels, and age. These are processed via fuzzy inference rules for risk estimation.

Result: The system was validated using UCI Machine Learning Repository data, showing effectiveness as a preliminary non-invasive assessment tool.

Conclusion: The system supports early identification of high-risk breast cancer patients and aids healthcare professionals in determining the need for further diagnostics.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women
worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

### [16] [A New Perspective on Precision and Recall for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02414)
*Benjamin Sykes,Loïc Simon,Julien Rabin,Jalal Fadili*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to estimate precision-recall (PR) curves for generative models, providing statistical analysis and minimax risk bounds for these estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in evaluating generative models, particularly moving beyond scalar metrics to richer analysis using PR curves.

Method: Developed a framework utilizing binary classification for estimating PR curves and performed statistical analysis on the methodology, including minimax risk assessment.

Result: The framework extends several existing PR metrics, offers more comprehensive curve analysis, and demonstrates experimental behaviors of PR curves in various setups.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves the evaluation of generative models by providing a robust and richer analysis tool through PR curves, addressing estimation challenges.

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

### [17] [ReAcTree: Hierarchical LLM Agent Trees with Control Flow for Long-Horizon Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02424)
*Jae-Woo Choi,Hyungmin Kim,Hyobin Ong,Minsu Jang,Dohyung Kim,Jaehong Kim,Youngwoo Yoon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes ReAcTree, a hierarchical task-planning method for embodied autonomous agents, which significantly improves success rates in complex long-horizon tasks compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decision-making methods for autonomous agents struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks due to reliance on a monolithic trajectory approach, which entangles past decisions and observations.

Method: ReAcTree uses a hierarchical approach that decomposes goals into manageable subgoals within an agent tree, supported by LLM nodes, control flow coordination, and dual memory systems (episodic and working memory).

Result: Experiments on the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets show that ReAcTree outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 61% success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B on WAH-NL compared to 31% by ReAct.

Conclusion: ReAcTree's hierarchical and memory-augmented method is highly effective for improving task-planning capabilities for long-horizon tasks in autonomous agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

*Mengyu Zhang,Xubo Liu,Siyu Ding,Weichong Yin,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Wenya Guo,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR uses reasoning enhancements in LLMs but struggles with open-ended tasks lacking standard answers. Introducing VMR reformulates these tasks for better training and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs can improve performance on open-ended tasks that lack ground-truth solutions.

Method: Introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation (VMR) to restructure open-ended tasks into verifiable multiple-choice formats, allowing effective RLVR application.

Result: Experimental results across eight benchmarks show an average performance improvement of 5.99 points over the baseline using VMR.

Conclusion: VMR successfully adapts RLVR for open-ended tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing reasoning capabilities and improving LLM performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

*Jorge Pellejero,Luis A. Hernández Gómez,Luis Mendo Tomás,Zoraida Frias Barroso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discusses Agentic AI, its foundational concepts, and role in automating decision-making in 5G and upcoming 6G networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of 5G and 6G networks makes manual optimization insufficient, creating the need for autonomous AI systems capable of adapting and making dynamic decisions.

Method: The paper introduces core design patterns of Agentic AI (e.g., multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning) and demonstrates these concepts through a practical 5G RAN case study involving time-series analysis and KPI-driven autonomous decision-making.

Result: Agentic AI principles were successfully applied to optimize RAN performance in 5G networks, showcasing its ability to enhance autonomous decision-making using LAMs.

Conclusion: Agentic AI represents a promising solution for handling complex and dynamic network environments, heralding a new era of AI-driven optimization through intelligent, autonomous systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

*Enhong Mu,Jinyu Cai,Yijun Lu,Mingyue Zhang,Kenji Tei,Jialong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The KLPEG framework combines Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models to efficiently address challenges in automated video game playtesting for iterative updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern video games require frequent updates and iterative improvements, posing challenges for precise playtesting due to lack of efficient and tailored mechanisms.

Method: KLPEG uses a Knowledge Graph to model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling structured knowledge accumulation, and employs LLMs for reasoning and test generation based on update logs.

Result: KLPEG demonstrated improved accuracy in identifying affected functionalities and reduced testing steps in Overcooked and Minecraft environments.

Conclusion: KLPEG offers a significant enhancement in the efficiency and accuracy of automated video game playtesting tailored for incremental updates.

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCA Benchmark evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain quantitative reasoning tasks using verified calculator outputs, revealing shortcomings in reasoning accuracy and numerical precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in LLMs' ability to perform quantitative reasoning across diverse real-life problem domains using a validated evaluation framework.

Method: ORCA Benchmark tests LLMs on 500 natural-language quantitative tasks, spanning various domains, using verified outputs from Omni's calculator engine.

Result: The evaluated LLMs achieved 45-63% accuracy, showing specific strengths in mathematics and engineering but weaknesses in physics and natural sciences. Common errors included rounding mistakes (35%) and calculation errors (33%), with models showing partial complementarity.

Conclusion: ORCA exposes weaknesses in step-by-step reasoning and domain generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, emphasizing the need for improvement in accurate numerical and domain-specific calculations.

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

### [22] [Adaptive GR(1) Specification Repair for Liveness-Preserving Shielding in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02605)
*Tiberiu-Andrei Georgescu,Alexander W. Goodall,Dalal Alrajeh,Francesco Belardinelli,Sebastian Uchitel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive shielding method for reinforcement learning using GR(1) specifications to ensure safety and liveness by detecting and addressing environment assumption violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static shielding approaches fail to adapt when environment assumptions are violated, leading to suboptimal performance and safety issues.

Method: The paper develops an adaptive framework based on GR(1) specifications and employs Inductive Logic Programming to repair these specifications online.

Result: Case studies show that the adaptive shield achieves near-optimal rewards and perfect logical compliance, outperforming static shields under varying assumptions.

Conclusion: Adaptive shielding improves both reward optimization and compliance in RL, ensuring a systematic and interpretable approach to safety and liveness.

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-agent psychological simulation system that models human behavior using explicit cognitive-affective processes grounded in psychological theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-centered training and education require realistic simulations of human behavior, but current systems fall short in providing authentic and transparent models.

Method: A multi-agent system simulates cognitive-affective processes using an "inner parliament" of agents based on psychological theories such as self-efficacy and social constructivism.

Result: The system generates believable human behaviors with alignment to psychological theories, offering enhanced transparency and usefulness for teacher training and research.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of transparent, theory-driven simulations in human-centered fields and demonstrates their application to education and training.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DecompSR is a dataset and generation framework for analyzing compositional spatial reasoning, containing over 5 million datapoints, and benchmarked across various LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for a dataset to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning abilities of language models, focusing on various aspects of compositionality.

Method: DecompSR is procedurally generated ensuring correctness through symbolic solver verification, and designed to vary factors like reasoning depth, linguistic variability, and more.

Result: LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalization in spatial reasoning but perform better with linguistic variability.

Conclusion: DecompSR enables robust and detailed evaluation of LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks through its flexible and reliable benchmarking dataset.

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

*Tim R. Davidson,Adam Fourney,Saleema Amershi,Robert West,Eric Horvitz,Ece Kamar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to study collaboration between heterogeneous AI agents in maze-solving tasks, revealing a significant performance gap when models collaborate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing reliance on multi-agent systems with independently developed agents and the challenge of ensuring effective collaboration among them.

Method: The method involves proposing a collaborative maze-solving benchmark focusing on isolating collaborative abilities, scalable automated grading, altering problem complexity, and maintaining ecological validity.

Result: Results show a 'collaboration gap,' where agents performing well individually degrade under collaboration. A 'relay inference' approach, where stronger agents lead, can mitigate this gap.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need for collaboration-aware evaluation, training to optimize collaborative capabilities, and interaction design to enhance latent skills in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CostBench is a benchmark designed to test large language models' economic reasoning and adaptability in travel-planning tasks under static and dynamic conditions, revealing significant gaps in their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations focus on task completion, neglecting aspects like resource efficiency and real-time adaptability in changing environments.

Method: The study introduces CostBench, a travel-planning benchmark with tasks involving multiple tools with varied costs, incorporating dynamic blocking events such as tool failures and cost changes.

Result: Leading models, including GPT-5, showed significant weaknesses in cost-aware planning, struggling in both static and dynamic settings.

Conclusion: CostBench provides insights into deficiencies in economic reasoning in LLMs and aims to guide the development of more adaptable and rational agents.

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

### [27] [Using Span Queries to Optimize for Cache and Attention Locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02749)
*Paul Castro,Nick Mitchell,Nathan Ordonez,Thomas Parnell,Mudhakar Srivatsa,Antoni Viros i Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'span queries,' a generalized interface for inference servers, enabling improvements in performance and flexibility for diverse tasks beyond chat completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference servers are heavily optimized for chat completion, but clients now require advanced methods like inference-time scaling and reasoning for non-chat tasks like RAG. Existing approaches are limited to single use cases.

Method: The authors propose span queries, expression trees of inference calls with commutativity constraints, differentiating tasks based on if input order matters (e.g., chat vs. RAG). They optimize KV cache locality and attention locality using span queries.

Result: Span queries achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for non-chat tasks and optimize attention locality to address accuracy issues like the lost-in-the-middle problem. Smaller models outperform larger ones using this method.

Conclusion: Span queries provide a flexible and efficient interface for inference servers, generalizing across multiple use cases and improving performance in both latency and accuracy.

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

Result: An interactive semantic layer was developed, enhancing source documents and facilitating knowledge transfer in control engineering.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new

knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

### [29] [When One Modality Sabotages the Others: A Diagnostic Lens on Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02794)
*Chenyu Zhang,Minsol Kim,Shohreh Ghorbani,Jingyao Wu,Rosalind Picard,Patricia Maes,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diagnostic framework to analyze reasoning traces in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), identifying when modality-specific errors mislead overall predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opaqueness of reasoning traces in MLLMs, specifically how different modalities interact, contribute to predictions, and potentially cause errors.

Method: The authors introduce a model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality in MLLMs as an agent. Candidate labels and self-assessments from each modality are aggregated by a simple fusion mechanism to analyze which modalities contribute to correct outcomes or lead to errors.

Result: The approach was applied to multimodal emotion recognition tasks, revealing systematic profiles of reliability and insights into whether issues stem from datasets or model limitations.

Conclusion: The diagnostic framework offers a structured way to audit multimodal reasoning dynamics, helping understand error sources, refine models, and suggest targeted interventions.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

*Mohamed Bouadi,Pratinav Seth,Aditya Tanna,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Orion-MSP, a tabular in-context learning architecture addressing limitations in prior approaches while achieving state-of-the-art results on high-dimensional tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of effective neural models for tabular data is challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions across scales. Current solutions have performance limitations in handling hierarchical dependencies, attention scaling, and iterative representation refinement.

Method: Orion-MSP incorporates multi-scale processing for hierarchical feature interactions, combines block-sparse attention patterns for efficiency, and employs a Perceiver-style memory enabling bidirectional information flow.

Result: Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art tabular in-context learning performance, efficiently scaling to high-dimensional tables and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Orion-MSP sets a new standard in efficient tabular in-context learning by addressing architectural limitations and achieving outstanding performance on diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,
developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to
heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple
scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN
and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to
gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,
current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature
processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with
quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component
processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and
cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce
Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)
multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)
block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for
scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style
memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across
diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance
while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new
standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .

*Chloe Loughridge,Paul Colognese,Avery Griffin,Tyler Tracy,Jon Kutasov,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to optimize attack policies in AI control evaluations by breaking down attack capabilities into individual skills and using a probabilistic model to improve attack strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI control evaluations require strong attack policies to estimate risk in complex environments, but data limitations present a challenge.

Method: The researchers decompose attack capability into five skills and develop a probabilistic model to optimize attack dynamics in data-constrained settings.

Result: Their optimized attack policies significantly improve performance, reducing the safety score from 0.87 to 0.41 in SHADE-Arena.

Conclusion: Optimizing individual attack components and leveraging probabilistic models can enhance attack strength for effective AI control evaluations.

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Kosmos is an AI scientist designed to facilitate repetitive tasks in data-driven discovery cycles, operating seamlessly for extended periods to deliver traceable scientific insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scientific discovery processes are iterative and time-consuming, limiting their efficiency for generating deep insights autonomously.

Method: Kosmos integrates a structured world model to enable coherent long-term collaboration between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent, streamlining scientific tasks into extended runs.

Result: Kosmos demonstrated remarkable performance producing accurate scientific reports, synthesizing data analysis and literature search, with its capability validated across 20 cycles, leading to novel contributions and reproducing findings in various scientific domains.

Conclusion: Kosmos proves to be an effective AI system to enhance scientific productivity and accelerate discovery, maintaining transparency and scaling output over extended cycles of operation.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

### [33] [Neurosymbolic Deep Learning Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02825)
*Artur d'Avila Garcez,Simon Odense*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of AI in scientific discovery due to the lack of semantics and proposes a neurosymbolic framework using logic to provide semantics for deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of AI lacking semantics in scientific discovery and improve understanding within AI-based science.

Method: The authors introduced a neurosymbolic framework linking neural networks and logic for semantic encoding and knowledge extraction.

Result: A formal definition of the proposed framework and review of existing approaches in neural encoding were presented, along with insights into practical difficulties and analogous philosophical challenges.

Conclusion: Logic can serve as an effective tool for providing semantics in AI, specifically deep learning, facilitating better scientific understanding and bridging gaps in AI-based knowledge systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models are limited in capability, requiring costly fine-tuning and remaining impractical for fully omni-modal integration and robust reasoning.

Method: Agent-Omni uses a master-agent system: the master agent interprets user requests, delegates tasks to specialized modality agents, and integrates their outputs into unified responses, enabling multimodal reasoning without retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate Agent-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal benchmarks, especially for tasks requiring cross-modal reasoning.

Conclusion: Agent-Omni provides a modular, extensible framework that leverages specialized models for flexible multimodal reasoning, enhancing adaptability, transparency, and scalability for future advancements.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

*Mansi Choudhary,Karthik Sangaiah,Sonali Singh,Muhammad Osama,Lisa Wu Wills,Ganesh Dasika*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Disaggregated AI GPUs face performance issues due to non-uniform memory access (NUMA). This paper introduces Swizzled Head-first Mapping strategy that improves memory locality and performance in attention workloads on GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the performance bottleneck caused by NUMA in large-scale attention workloads on modern multi-chiplet AI GPUs.

Method: Developing Swizzled Head-first Mapping, a scheduling strategy that aligns attention heads with GPU NUMA domains for optimal cache usage.

Result: On AMD's MI300X architecture, the proposed method achieves up to 50% higher performance compared to traditional scheduling strategies, with high L2 cache hit rates (80-97%).

Conclusion: NUMA-aware scheduling is essential for improving the efficiency of disaggregated GPUs, supporting scalable AI training and inference in future architectures.

Abstract: The rise of disaggregated AI GPUs has exposed a critical bottleneck in
large-scale attention workloads: non-uniform memory access (NUMA). As
multi-chiplet designs become the norm for scaling compute capabilities, memory
latency and bandwidth vary sharply across compute regions, undermining the
performance of traditional GPU kernel scheduling strategies that assume uniform
memory access. We identify how these NUMA effects distort locality in
multi-head attention (MHA) and present Swizzled Head-first Mapping, a
spatially-aware scheduling strategy that aligns attention heads with GPU NUMA
domains to exploit intra-chiplet cache reuse. On AMD's MI300X architecture, our
method achieves up to 50% higher performance over state-of-the-art attention
algorithms using conventional scheduling techniques and sustains consistently
high L2 cache hit rates of 80-97%. These results demonstrate that NUMA-aware
scheduling is now fundamental to achieving full efficiency on next-generation
disaggregated GPUs, offering a path forward for scalable AI training and
inference.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces BoolSkeleton, a method to improve consistency in Boolean networks by leveraging preprocessing and reduction techniques, achieving significant improvements in accuracy for tasks like timing prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of consistency and reliability in Boolean networks due to diverse graph structures under Boolean equivalence.

Method: BoolSkeleton uses preprocessing to create a Boolean dependency graph with functionality-related statuses, followed by node-level pattern reduction distinguishing heterogeneous and homogeneous patterns constrained by a parameter K.

Result: Experimental validation of BoolSkeleton demonstrates its robustness across tasks like compression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing prediction, yielding a 55% improvement in timing prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: BoolSkeleton enhances design consistency and reliability in Boolean networks, offering significant improvements and adaptability across multiple analysis tasks in logic synthesis.

Abstract: Boolean equivalence allows Boolean networks with identical functionality to
exhibit diverse graph structures. This gives more room for exploration in logic
optimization, while also posing a challenge for tasks involving consistency
between Boolean networks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce BoolSkeleton,
a novel Boolean network skeletonization method that improves the consistency
and reliability of design-specific evaluations. BoolSkeleton comprises two key
steps: preprocessing and reduction. In preprocessing, the Boolean network is
transformed into a defined Boolean dependency graph, where nodes are assigned
the functionality-related status. Next, the homogeneous and heterogeneous
patterns are defined for the node-level pattern reduction step. Heterogeneous
patterns are preserved to maintain critical functionality-related dependencies,
while homogeneous patterns can be reduced. Parameter K of the pattern further
constrains the fanin size of these patterns, enabling fine-tuned control over
the granularity of graph reduction. To validate BoolSkeleton's effectiveness,
we conducted four analysis/downstream tasks around the Boolean network:
compression analysis, classification, critical path analysis, and timing
prediction, demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios. Furthermore,
it improves above 55% in the average accuracy compared to the original Boolean
network for the timing prediction task. These experiments underscore the
potential of BoolSkeleton to enhance design consistency in logic synthesis.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI for tasks like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

efficiency, they lack the programmability to adapt to evolving algorithms. To
address this trade-off, we implement and evaluate Whisper's core computational

*Zhuorui Zhao,Bing Li,Grace Li Zhang,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VFocus, a framework to improve Verilog code generation by focusing AI reasoning on key decision points, significantly enhancing correctness in hardware design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of ensuring functional correctness in Verilog code generation by LLMs, which is missed by existing self-consistency or simulation feedback systems.

Method: VFocus framework consists of three stages: pre-ranking (generating and filtering candidates through density-guided filtering), ranking (simulating and clustering the candidates), and post-ranking refinement (mining inconsistencies and refining outputs with reasoning-enhanced prompts).

Result: Experiments demonstrate that VFocus improves the pass@1 correctness on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark across multiple reasoning LLMs.

Conclusion: VFocus effectively enhances LLM performance in generating functionally correct Verilog code, proving its strength in complex hardware design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in generating
Verilog codes, but ensuring functional correctness remains a challenge.
Existing approaches often rely on self-consistency or simulation feedback to
select the best candidate, but they miss opportunities to focus LLM reasoning
on the most informative parts of the design. We propose VFocus, a three-stage
framework that enhances Verilog generation by sharpening the focus of LLM
reasoning onto critical decision points in the code generation process. In the
\textbf{pre-ranking stage}, VFocus generates multiple code candidates through
LLM prompting, retries for syntactically valid outputs, and introduces a
\textit{Density-guided Filtering} to retain candidates that fall within the
"reasoning sweet spot" for functional correctness. In the \textbf{ranking
stage}, we simulate each code candidate using an automatically generated
testbench and apply self-consistency-based clustering to identify the most
consistent outputs. Finally, in the \textbf{post-ranking refinement stage},
VFocus performs inconsistency mining on top-ranked candidates and invokes
reasoning-augmented LLM prompts for candidate refinement. Experiments on the
VerilogEval-Human benchmark show that VFocus significantly improves the pass@1
correctness across multiple reasoning LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in
enhancing Verilog generation for complex hardware design tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of previous FPGA-based systems, such as poor face detection accuracy and inefficient resource usage, and to improve the throughput of facial expression recognition systems.

Method: Implemented a system using DenseBox for face detection and CNN for facial expression recognition, both executed on a general-purpose CNN accelerator (DPU). A multi-threading technique was also developed to enhance throughput and resource utilization efficiency.

Result: Achieved an overall system throughput of 25 FPS and a 2.4x improvement in power efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient use of FPGA resources in facial expression recognition, highlighting a significant performance increase through hardware optimization.

Abstract: In this paper, we implement a stand-alone facial expression recognition
system on an SoC FPGA with multi-threading using a Deep learning Processor Unit
(DPU). The system consists of two steps: one for face detection step and one
for facial expression recognition. In the previous work, the Haar Cascade
detector was run on a CPU in the face detection step due to FPGA resource
limitations, but this detector is less accurate for profile and variable
illumination condition images. Moreover, the previous work used a dedicated
circuit accelerator, so running a second DNN inference for face detection on
the FPGA would require the addition of a new accelerator. As an alternative to
this approach, we run the two inferences by DNN on a DPU, which is a
general-purpose CNN accelerator of the systolic array type. Our method for face
detection using DenseBox and facial expression recognition using CNN on the
same DPU enables the efficient use of FPGA resources while maintaining a small
circuit size. We also developed a multi-threading technique that improves the
overall throughput while increasing the DPU utilization efficiency. With this
approach, we achieved an overall system throughput of 25 FPS and a throughput
per power consumption of 2.4 times.

incorporates hardware-centric optimizations including redundant arithmetic,

synthesis evaluations across multiple posit configurations demonstrate
significant performance improvements, including more than 80% energy reduction
with small area overhead compared to existing methods, and a substantial

our adapted algorithm to enhance the efficiency of posit-based arithmetic
units.

*Rongxin Chen,Yunfan Li,Yige Yuan,Bingbing Xu,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for multi-personality generation in large language models (LLMs) using a decoding-time method, avoiding costly retraining and external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-personality generation in LLMs rely heavily on retraining or external models, which are resource-intensive and lack scalability. A more efficient, flexible, and scalable approach is needed.

Method: The MPG framework utilizes implicit density ratios within single-dimensional models to combine multiple personalities without retraining, implemented through Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR) for efficient response generation.

Result: Experiments using MBTI personality attributes and Role-Playing scenarios showed that MPG significantly improved performance, with gains of up to 16%-18%.

Conclusion: The proposed MPG approach provides a scalable and robust method for enabling multi-personality functionality in LLMs, achieving high efficiency and quality without external dependencies or extensive retraining.

Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of
multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing
retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time
methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and
robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation
(MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly
controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models
or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional
models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target
strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design
Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates
responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds
within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead
while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and
Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to
16%-18%. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Libra117/MPG .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine whether smaller domain-specific models, like GNNs, can replace large language models (LLMs) in simulating human choices.

Method: GEMS uses graph-based modeling, transforming discrete choice simulation problems into link prediction tasks by leveraging relational knowledge and minimal language representations.

Result: GEMS outperformed or matched LLM baselines in accuracy across multiple datasets while being more efficient, interpretable, and transparent.

Conclusion: Graph-based models like GEMS present a lightweight and effective alternative to LLMs for human simulation, providing high efficiency and clarity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with
applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are
LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We
identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices
among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass
strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We
introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete
choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging
relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when
needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show
that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater
efficiency, interpretability, and transparency, highlighting the promise of
graph-based modeling as a lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation.

### [44] [IG-Pruning: Input-Guided Block Pruning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02213)
*Kangyu Qiao,Shaolei Zhang,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IG-Pruning, a dynamic block-wise pruning method for efficient computation in large language models, outperforming static pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in current fixed mask pruning approaches for large language models, which fail to adapt dynamically to varying tasks and inputs.

Method: The approach involves two stages: (1) discovering mask candidates via semantic clustering and L0 optimization, and (2) applying dynamic pruning efficiently without extensive retraining.

Result: IG-Pruning achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art static pruning methods, enabling better efficiency in computationally constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: Dynamic and input-aware pruning, as proposed by IG-Pruning, is a more effective way to reduce computational costs in large language models while maintaining performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

*Jonathan Liu,Haoling Qiu,Jonathan Lasko,Damianos Karakos,Mahsa Yarmohammadi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to evaluate medical chatbot responses from LLMs, addressing failures due to hallucinations and biases stemming from demographic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure medical chatbots provide consistent and unbiased advice, especially when engaging with diverse demographic scenarios, given the prevalence of hallucinations and biases in LLMs.

Method: The authors devised a pipeline for generating realistic demographic-based queries and employed multiple LLMs to assess hallucinations, omissions, and response consistency. They also conducted case studies focusing on inter-LLM agreement.

Result: Findings include low agreement among LLM annotators (average Cohen's Kappa 0.118), suggesting that only specific LLM pairings yield reliable statistical evaluations across demographic variables.

Conclusion: Using multiple LLM evaluators ensures more reliable outcomes and transparency when assessing LLM responses, especially in sensitive applications like medical advice.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

*Liuhao Lin,Ke Li,Zihan Xu,Yuchen Shi,Yulei Qin,Yan Zhang,Xing Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LTD-Bench, a new benchmark to evaluate large language models' spatial reasoning ability through visual outputs like drawings and code generation, highlighting deficiencies in traditional evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for large language models are opaque and fail to reveal fundamental limitations like spatial reasoning, leading to a discrepancy between reported performance and practical real-world abilities.

Method: The authors developed LTD-Bench, a benchmark that assesses spatial reasoning via tasks requiring models to generate dot matrix drawings or executable code, as well as complementary generation and recognition tasks across three levels of difficulty.

Result: Experiments showed that state-of-the-art models, despite performing well on traditional benchmarks, struggle severely with bidirectional mappings between language and spatial concepts.

Conclusion: LTD-Bench reveals significant capability gaps in current LLMs, provides intuitive diagnostics through visual outputs, and serves as a tool to investigate model similarities, emphasizing the need for robust spatial understanding in LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

### [47] [Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358)
*Wongyu Kim,Hochang Lee,Sanghak Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Solomon introduces an adaptive query augmentation approach using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), selectively augmenting queries to reduce latency and improve performance in multimodal embedding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for query augmentation rely on always augmenting queries using Large Language Models, leading to higher latency and less efficient performance in some cases. Challenges also exist in applying these methods in multimodal environments.

Method: M-Solomon divides training queries into groups based on augmentation requirements, uses a synthesis process leveraging MLLMs to generate augmentations selectively, and employs a prefix-based approach to differentiate embedding-only queries from augmented ones.

Result: M-Solomon demonstrated significant performance improvements over baselines using constant or zero augmentation. It also accomplished faster embedding times due to its adaptive augmentation approach.

Conclusion: M-Solomon effectively balances query augmentation and embedding for multimodal environments, achieving faster processing speeds and improved query representation compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AyurParam-2.9B is a bilingual LLM designed for Ayurveda, outperforming models of its size and competing with larger ones using a curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream LLMs fail in domains requiring deep cultural and subject-specific expertise, such as Ayurveda.

Method: Developed AyurParam-2.9B with fine-tuning of a pre-existing LLM using a curated Ayurveda dataset in English and Hindi.

Result: AyurParam surpasses open-source models in its parameter range and rivals larger models in benchmark tests.

Conclusion: Focused domain adaptation and quality supervision are essential to create reliable AI for specialized domains like Ayurveda.

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

### [50] [AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376)
*Aashray Reddy,Andrew Zagula,Nicholas Saban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoAdv, a framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking of large language models (LLMs), showcasing vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms during extended interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating the robustness of LLMs during adaptive multi-turn conversations, which better reflect real-world scenarios compared to single-turn interactions.

Method: The authors developed AutoAdv, which employs three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager, a temperature manager, and a two-phase rewriting strategy, to efficiently carry out multi-turn jailbreaking attacks.

Result: AutoAdv achieved a 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B in six turns, outperforming single-turn baselines by 24%, and demonstrated weaknesses in multiple LLM models during multi-turn evaluations.

Conclusion: Existing single-turn focused alignment strategies are insufficient for defending against adaptive, multi-turn attacks, emphasizing the need for robust multi-turn-aware safety mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

### [51] [Merging Continual Pretraining Models for Domain-Specialized LLMs: A Case Study in Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02451)
*Kentaro Ueda,François Portet,Hirohiko Suwa,Keiichi Yasumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with specialized domains like finance, requiring domain knowledge and advanced reasoning. This paper explores merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training (CPT) models to address this and presents methods and evaluations to create better-performing multi-skill financial LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have difficulty performing in specialized domains, such as finance, which demand a combination of domain knowledge, complex reasoning, and multilingual skills. Current approaches to multi-skill training are costly and unstable, motivating the need for efficient model-merging techniques.

Method: Three merging methods—Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES—are evaluated based on their ability to recover knowledge, enhance complementarity, and create emergent cross-domain skills. The experiments involve financial experts and use an 18-task benchmark drawn from 8 datasets.

Result: Merging CPT models can recover general knowledge, improve overall performance, and generate emergent cross-domain skills. Task Arithmetic provides strong results but is sensitive to hyperparameters, while TIES is more robust. Model similarity plays a role in merging success, but emergent skills depend on complex factors.

Conclusion: This foundational study provides a framework and methods for merging CPT models, presenting pathways to efficiently create multi-skilled financial LLMs from existing assets while showcasing the complementary strengths of different merging techniques.

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing
assets.

### [52] [Prompting for Policy: Forecasting Macroeconomic Scenarios with Synthetic LLM Personas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02458)
*Giulia Iadisernia,Carolina Camassa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether persona-based prompting enhances GPT-4o's macroeconomic forecasting. Experiments reveal GPT-4o performs comparably to human forecasters in accuracy. Persona prompts do not significantly impact forecast quality, simplifying computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if using persona-based prompts improves the forecasting accuracy of GPT-4o compared to human experts for macroeconomic data.

Method: The study employed persona-based prompts using 2,368 personas from PersonaHub to forecast quarterly economic indicators (2013-2025), comparing results to human expert forecasts and baseline GPT-4o predictions without personas.

Result: GPT-4o and human forecasters performed similarly in accuracy. Persona prompts did not provide measurable forecasting advantages, enabling computational savings.

Conclusion: GPT-4o demonstrates competitive forecasting performance on both observed and novel (out-of-sample) macroeconomic events without requiring persona prompts.

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in manual hiring processes, including time consumption, human error, and bias.

Method: The approach combines document parsing, named entity recognition, and contextual text embeddings to extract and match candidate data with job descriptions via a shared vector space for similarity scoring.

Result: Experiments on a real-world dataset showed the system's robustness and ability to achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining interpretability and transparency.

Conclusion: Smart-Hiring provides a scalable NLP framework for recruitment, introducing potential for bias mitigation and fairness-aware approaches in hiring processes.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes
for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and
subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural
Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract
structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match
candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document
parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to
capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics,
Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space
to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline
is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and
matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of
resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains,
demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The
system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of
interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces
a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines
promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and
large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

*Max Norris,Kobi Gal,Sahan Bulathwela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Next Token Knowledge Tracing (NTKT), a model leveraging large language models to improve student knowledge prediction by including question content in addition to interaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to better predict student responses in educational platforms by addressing limitations in existing methods that often ignore question text.

Method: The approach reframes the Knowledge Tracing (KT) task as a next-token prediction leveraging pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), incorporating both student interaction histories and question text.

Result: The proposed method shows significant performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art KT models, especially in cold-start scenarios such as new questions and users.

Conclusion: Incorporating question text using pretrained LLMs enhances modeling student learning and improves predictions, emphasizing the importance of question insights in KT.

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

*Ehsan Aghazadeh,Ahmad Ghasemi,Hedyeh Beyhaghi,Hossein Pishro-Nik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Confidence-Guided Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework for reducing the number of queries to large language models while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency in querying large language models requires a fixed number of calls and struggles with rare correct answers. The motivation is to create a method that adaptively reduces query numbers and handles rare answers effectively.

Method: The CGES method uses Bayesian posteriors formed from scalar confidence signals based on token probabilities or reward models. It halts sampling adaptively when confidence surpasses a threshold.

Result: CGES achieved a 69% reduction in model calls while maintaining near-identical accuracy compared to the self-consistency method over five reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach achieves significant efficiency improvements while maintaining accuracy, offering theoretical guarantees and practical advancements over existing strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

*Aakash Sen Sharma,Debdeep Sanyal,Vivek Srivastava,Shirish Karande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current methods in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and introduces a new framework called TRACE for scalable and accurate re-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the current drawbacks in aligning LLMs with evolving human values and norms, which include static models, costly updates, and declining performance with outdated approaches.

Method: The authors propose TRACE, a framework that programmatically evaluates conflicts between existing preferences and new policies and applies precise optimization to maintain model performance while implementing policy changes.

Result: TRACE effectively aligns LLMs like Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and Llama-3.1-8B across synthetic benchmarks and real datasets, ensuring alignment without loss of general capabilities.

Conclusion: The study establishes TRACE as a scalable, efficient, and reliable approach to dynamically align LLMs, ensuring their long-term utility and safety in AI deployment.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

*Renfei Dang,Peng Hu,Changjiang Gao,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing new knowledge during LLM fine-tuning can lead to factual hallucinations. Fine-tuning with highly unfamiliar knowledge types intensifies these tendencies, which can be mitigated by KnownPatch methodology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the mechanisms behind factual hallucinations caused by introducing new knowledge during LLM fine-tuning, filling the gap in existing research.

Method: Create a controlled dataset (Biography-Reasoning) and analyze hallucination tendencies across multiple knowledge types and tasks. Propose KnownPatch to incorporate known knowledge samples in fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuning with entirely new knowledge types leads to higher hallucination risks. KnownPatch significantly reduces these hallucinations and improves model performance.

Conclusion: Highly unfamiliar knowledge intensifies hallucinations. KnownPatch mitigates attention disruptions and improves the learning of new knowledge without hallucination.

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

### [59] [Optimal Singular Damage: Efficient LLM Inference in Low Storage Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02681)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to efficiently store fine-tuned parameters in large language models (LLMs) by selectively sparsifying low-rank approximations and retaining critical components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the storage challenge of fine-tuned parameter updates in large language models, as storing multiple fine-tuned versions for diverse tasks is inefficacious.

Method: The paper leverages the low-rank and sparse nature of fine-tuning updates. It introduces a method called 'optimal singular damage,' which selectively sparsifies low-rank approximations by prioritizing more impactful singular components.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates better storage efficiency and superior accuracy compared to individual use of low-rank approximation or sparsification, under the same memory constraints.

Conclusion: Selective sparsification of low-rank approximations enhances both storage efficiency and model accuracy for fine-tuned LLMs, making the process more resource-effective.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

*Doreen Osmelak,Koel Dutta Chowdhury,Uliana Sentsova,Cristina España-Bonet,Josef van Genabith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PragExTra, a multilingual corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation in translation, focusing on cultural enrichment for diverse audiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translators enrich texts to make implicit cultural meanings explicit for diverse audiences, but this phenomenon (pragmatic explicitation) lacks computational modeling.

Method: The authors develop PragExTra using eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl datasets, applying techniques like null alignment and active learning with human annotation.

Result: Entity and system-level explicitations are identified as most frequent, with active learning enhancing classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points and performance metrics reaching up to 0.88 accuracy and 0.82 F1.

Conclusion: The study defines pragmatic explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic concept and contributes toward culturally aware machine translation systems.

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,
multilingualism, explicitation

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI adoption is hindered in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs) due to poor performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why AI adoption is uneven globally, focusing on the impact of language accessibility on adoption in LRLCs.

Method: A weighted regression model was used to separate the impact of language from socioeconomic and demographic factors.

Result: AI adoption in LRLCs is approximately 20% lower than expected, indicating linguistic accessibility hampers AI diffusion.

Conclusion: Improving linguistic accessibility in AI systems is essential for equitable global adoption and diffusion of AI technologies.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

*Bowen Jin,TJ Collins,Donghan Yu,Mert Cemri,Shenao Zhang,Mengyu Li,Jay Tang,Tian Qin,Zhiyang Xu,Jiarui Lu,Guoli Yin,Jiawei Han,Zirui Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A centralized multi-agent framework called CoRL using reinforcement learning efficiently coordinates expert LLMs, optimizing performance under varied budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) have domain-specific strengths but also high inference costs, necessitating cost-efficient multi-agent systems.

Method: A controller LLM is employed within a centralized framework using reinforcement learning to coordinate expert models while balancing performance and cost trade-offs.

Result: CoRL outperforms individual expert models under high budgets and retains strong performance under low budgets, demonstrating scalability and cost-efficiency.

Conclusion: Centralized coordination via CoRL is effective for creating scalable, adaptable systems that leverage diverse LLMs while controlling inference costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

*Hung-Ting Chen,Xiang Liu,Shauli Ravfogel,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMER, a new retrieval model addressing multimodal query distributions using multiple query vectors, showcasing significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of current retrievers that struggle with multimodal conditional distributions of query results, especially when document embeddings are distant.

Method: Developing Autoregressive Multi-Embedding Retriever (AMER) that generates multiple query vectors autoregressively for retrieving diverse relevant documents.

Result: AMER achieved a 4x better performance on synthetic data and 4% and 21% higher relative gains over baseline models on two real-world datasets, especially excelling in scenarios with dissimilar target document embeddings.

Conclusion: The AMER retriever demonstrates significant improvement in handling multimodal queries, showcasing potential for further advances in multi-query vector retrieval research.

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

### [64] [MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02805)
*Qianhao Yuan,Jie Lou,Zichao Li,Jiawei Chen,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Le Sun,Debing Zhang,Xianpei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemSearcher balances maintaining relevant memory and current interaction context to overcome noisy or information-loss trade-offs in search agents, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search agents either retain all interaction data (inefficient and noisy) or use only current data (sacrificing vital information), hindering scalability. Addressing this trade-off is critical for efficient and accurate long-turn tasks.

Method: MemSearcher uses compact memory and iterates its updates alongside the current interaction. It employs multi-context GRPO for reinforcement learning to optimize reasoning, search, and memory management. RL propagates trajectory benefits across multiple contexts.

Result: MemSearcher achieves up to 12% relative accuracy gains over baselines on seven benchmarks using lower computational resources. Trained on Search-R1, it outperforms larger models even when smaller in scale.

Conclusion: MemSearcher demonstrates that balancing memory integrity with efficiency improves task accuracy significantly while reducing computational overhead. This approach leads to scalable, effective search agent workflows.

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and
lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at

*Amanda Bertsch,Adithya Pratapa,Teruko Mitamura,Graham Neubig,Matthew R. Gormley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Oolong, a benchmark set designed to test reasoning tasks over extended context lengths, showcasing the challenges current models face in long-context reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations of existing long-context evaluations, which often disregard much of the context as noise and fail to reflect diverse reasoning needs with long-context inputs.

Method: The researchers developed Oolong, a benchmark divided into two parts: Oolong-synth (synthetic, ablatable tasks) and Oolong-real (real-world conversational data), designed to test diverse reasoning requirements like classification, counting, and temporal analysis.

Result: Even advanced language models like GPT-5 and others showed less than 50% accuracy on Oolong tasks when evaluated on large context lengths of up to 128K.

Conclusion: Current state-of-the-art models struggle significantly in performing long-context reasoning tasks presented in the Oolong benchmark, signaling the need for advancements in model capabilities to effectively utilize extended context lengths.

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces iFlyBot-VLA, a multi-modal model combining vision, language, and action (VLA), designed for robotic manipulation tasks using a new dual-level action representation framework and mixed training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic manipulation tasks by enhancing the 3D perceptual and reasoning capacities of vision-language models, bridging vision, language, and actions.

Method: The authors developed a model trained with a dual-level action representation, combining high-level latent actions with low-level discrete action tokens, and incorporated a mixed training strategy using diverse datasets.

Result: Experimental results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark validate the model's effectiveness, while real-world evaluations show competitive performance in challenging tasks.

Conclusion: The iFlyBot-VLA framework effectively aligns vision, language, and actions, significantly enhancing robotic manipulation models and offering resources to inspire further research.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining significantly improves the ability of foundation models to discriminate subtle anatomical features in fetal ultrasound imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the ability of vision foundation models to discriminate anatomically similar structures in fetal ultrasound imaging, particularly in challenging low inter-class variability settings.

Method: Created a multicenter benchmark (FetalUS-188K) aggregating over 188,000 images and pretrained DINOv3 using self-supervised learning to study its performance under various initialization schemes.

Result: Domain-adaptive pretraining on fetal ultrasound data yielded significant improvements, with up to 20% weighted F1-score increases over models initialized on natural images.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive pretraining is necessary for robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal ultrasound imaging when dealing with low inter-class variability anatomical structures.

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) such as Clay outperform traditional models like U-Net in flood mapping accuracy, computational efficiency, and label data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) in improving flood inundation mapping compared to traditional models like U-Net.

Method: Several GFMs (Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT) are systematically benchmarked against traditional models (TransNorm, U-Net, Attention U-Net) using satellite imagery from PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 across different sensors and regions.

Result: Clay demonstrated superior performance in most cases, showing better accuracy (mIoU values), computational efficiency, and ability to retain fine details. It also performed effectively with fewer training images and proved to be faster due to its smaller model size.

Conclusion: GFMs can offer small to moderate improvements over traditional methods in flood mapping while reducing computational costs and labeling efforts, with Clay emerging as a particularly strong option.

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for image reconstruction from incomplete measurements using a learning-based framework that performs comparably to fully supervised approaches without requiring complete ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of image reconstruction using limited and deterministic sampling patterns, aiming to minimize dependence on fully sampled ground truth data.

Method: The approach leverages multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution to achieve effective reconstruction performance using incomplete ground truth data.

Result: The method is validated through optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy, yielding competitive or superior reconstruction results while using less ground truth data.

Conclusion: The study shows that reconstruction performance equivalent to supervised methods can be achieved with less ground truth data, offering efficient solutions for scenarios with incomplete measurements.

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the efficacy of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for detecting Protected Health Information in medical imaging, comparing them to traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect patient privacy and adhere to regulations by improving the detection of PHI in medical imaging through advanced technologies.

Method: The authors benchmark three LMM models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B) using two pipeline setups: text analysis and OCR-semantic integration.

Result: LMM models outperform traditional OCR models in OCR-specific metrics like Word Error Rate and Character Error Rate, but their advantage does not consistently translate into better overall PHI detection accuracy.

Conclusion: LMMs are particularly effective in complex imprint patterns but show similar results to traditional models in readable conditions. Recommendations and deployment strategies are provided to optimize their use.

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive datasets for monitoring strength-demanding activities using wearable sensors.

Method: Developed a dataset with IMU signals capturing 11 strength-demanding and 2 non-strength demanding activities. Data were collected from 29 subjects using 10 IMUs and annotated via video recordings.

Result: The dataset demonstrated good technical validation; comparative analysis showed accurate joint angle estimations by IMUs verified against video data.

Conclusion: StrengthSense offers a valuable resource for advancing human activity recognition and fitness/health applications development.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel pipeline for automating the creation of large-scale text-VQA datasets by synthesizing around 72K QA pairs from 44K images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the difficulty and skill involved in manually annotating text-VQA datasets, the paper aims to create a scalable, automated pipeline leveraging vision-language models and OCR for efficient dataset generation.

Method: The proposed pipeline integrates OCR text spotting, ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation in a streamlined approach to synthesize and validate QA pairs from images.

Result: The pipeline successfully synthesizes a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising 72K QA pairs from 44K images, demonstrating scalability and faithfulness to scene text data.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first automated pipeline for large-scale text-VQA dataset synthesis, proving its effectiveness and scalability for future scene-text data challenges.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

### [73] [Markerless Augmented Reality Registration for Surgical Guidance: A Multi-Anatomy Clinical Accuracy Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02086)
*Yue Yang,Fabian Necker,Christoph Leuze,Michelle Chen,Andrey Finegersh,Jake Lee,Vasu Divi,Bruce Daniel,Brian Hargreaves,Jie Ying Wu,Fred M Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a depth-only markerless AR registration pipeline clinically tested on HoloLens 2 to assist surgeries in registering small or low-curvature anatomies with ~3-4 mm median error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve surgical guidance accuracy without using fiducials through a markerless registration pipeline tailored for small or low-curvature anatomies.

Method: Developed on HoloLens 2 using Articulated HAnd Tracking (AHAT) depth, aligned to CT-derived skin meshes through depth-bias correction, human-in-the-loop initialization, and global/local registration. Conducted preclinical validations and intraoperative trials during surgeries.

Result: Preclinical validation revealed errors of about 0.78 mm to 1.2 mm. Clinical trials (feet, ear, lower leg) achieved a median error of ~3.9 mm with significant differences across anatomical areas.

Conclusion: The method demonstrated clinical applicability, achieving ~3-4 mm error thresholds for moderate-risk surgical tasks, enhancing the readiness of markerless AR systems in live operative conditions via human-guided initialization and robust registration approaches.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

*Ali Farki,Elaheh Moradi,Deepika Koundal,Jussi Tohka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops and evaluates deep learning models to predict future brain MRI images from baseline MRI data, focusing on neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of forecasting future brain state from baseline MRI images for understanding and predicting patterns of neurodegeneration.

Method: The authors implement and compare five deep learning models (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, ODE-UNet) trained on longitudinal datasets (ADNI and AIBL) to predict future brain MRIs.

Result: The evaluated models produce high-quality future brain MRI predictions, showing strong generalization capabilities to independent datasets and robust performance across cohorts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that deep learning models can effectively model participant-specific brain MRI progression, enabling new ways for individualized prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

### [75] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline combining instance segmentation and chamber-ordering algorithms to reconstruct planktonic foraminifera growth trajectories, reducing manual effort and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planktonic foraminifera's chambered growth offers insights into environmental conditions and ecological adaptation, but manual tracing is time-intensive and subjective.

Method: An end-to-end automated pipeline integrates instance segmentation and chamber-ordering algorithms to analyze growth trajectories from CT scans.

Result: The pipeline demonstrated reduced manual effort and maintained accuracy in reconstructing 3D developmental trajectories, verified by experimental datasets.

Conclusion: The study establishes the first fully automated method for foraminiferal growth analysis, enabling scalable and reproducible ecological research.

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in precise measurement of pavement crack widths caused by complex crack morphologies and the need for rapid, arbitrary pixel measurements.

Method: A three-stage framework is introduced, comprising crack segmentation, PCA for orientation axis determination, and RPCA for extracting Main Propagation Axis to handle irregular geometries.

Result: Evaluation on public datasets shows improved computational efficiency and measurement accuracy over current techniques.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective solution for precise crack width quantification, facilitating better pavement condition assessments and maintenance decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impact of flicker effects caused by rapid light intensity variations, which deteriorates the performance of event cameras in diverse settings.

Method: A novel autobiasing system using CNNs is introduced to detect and mitigate flicker effects by dynamically adjusting the inherent biases of event cameras, eliminating the need for extra hardware or software solutions.

Result: Significant improvements in YOLO confidence for face detection and frame detection rates, alongside a reduction in average gradient by 38.2% (well-lit) and 53.6% (low-light), showcasing effective flicker mitigation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances event camera functionality by reducing flicker effects, proving valuable across adverse lighting conditions and frequency variations.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for diagnosing ocular diseases; however, challenges arise due to thin and branching vasculature with significant variability across images.

Method: MM-UNet employs Morph Mamba Convolution layers for enhanced topological perception and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules for improved boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.

Result: MM-UNet showed superior accuracy, improving F1-scores on DRIVE by 1.64% and on STARE by 1.25%, compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed MM-UNet demonstrates effectiveness in addressing segmentation precision and robustness challenges, marking advancements in the field of retinal vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

TL;DR: This study introduces a generative model that predicts amyloid-beta PET spatial patterns using blood biomarkers and MRI, providing accessible alternatives for Alzheimer's diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diagnosis of Alzheimer's relies on expensive, limited Abeta-PET imaging. This research aims to predict PET patterns using more accessible methods such as blood biomarkers and MRI scans.

Method: A generative model combining large language models and multimodal fusion synthesizes PET images, evaluated for quality, diagnostic reliability, and clinical use within a fully automated diagnostic pipeline.

Result: Synthesized PET images strongly resemble real ones in structural and diagnostic quality, leading to high diagnosis accuracy. The synthetic PET model outperforms other approaches using T1-weighted MRI or biomarkers, with improved AUC values when combined.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates realistic PET image synthesis using blood biomarkers and MRI scans, enhancing diagnostic workflows and accessibility for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

*Jiajia Li,Keyi Zhu,Qianwen Zhang,Dong Chen,Qi Sun,Zhaojian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for object-centered 3D reconstruction of strawberry plants using advanced techniques like SAM-2 for masking and geometric analysis, outperforming traditional phenotyping methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phenotyping methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and destructive, creating the need for scalable and accurate non-destructive solutions for plant trait analysis.

Method: The study uses neural rendering frameworks like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), combined with a preprocessing pipeline using SAM-2 for background removal, followed by DBSCAN clustering and PCA for trait estimation.

Result: The proposed framework significantly improves accuracy and efficiency in estimating plant traits, producing clean geometric reconstructions without background noise.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a scalable, accurate, and non-destructive method for phenotyping strawberries, addressing limitations of scene-level reconstructions in traditional methods and offering better solutions for agricultural domains.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study proposes an automated pipeline, autoStrain, for segmental longitudinal strain estimation in transesophageal echocardiography using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for LV strain estimation are labor-intensive, requiring manual effort and expertise, making them inefficient for routine monitoring.

Method: The study introduces two deep learning-based models, TeeFlow and TeeTracker, trained on synthetic TEE datasets to estimate myocardial motion, validated clinically on patient data.

Result: TeeTracker demonstrated superior accuracy with a mean distance error of 0.65 mm on synthetic data while clinical validation showed alignment with reference methods with a mean difference of 1.09%.

Conclusion: AI-driven motion estimation with TEE improves precision and efficiency in cardiac function assessment, aiding better diagnosis and management of ischemia.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile sensing systems often face efficiency and sensing quality challenges due to computational and power constraints, driving exploration into sparse sensing strategies.

Method: The study evaluates foundation models using real-world mobile AR data to analyze improvements in geometry-aware image warping and the potential scalability for sparse sensing applications.

Result: Foundation models significantly improve geometry-aware image warping accuracy and enhance 3D scene reconstruction capabilities compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The integration of foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems offers notable advancements but also reveals open challenges and opportunities for further exploration in the field.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new framework for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis using MRI and PET neuroimaging to address modality-specific feature challenges and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is essential, but existing multimodal fusion methods overly rely on cross-modal complementarity and ignore modality-specific features, leading to biased and noisy representations.

Method: The authors present the Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion framework that includes learnable parameter representation (LPR) blocks, shared and modality-independent encoders, and a consistency-guided mechanism to align distributions.

Result: Experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing multimodal fusion strategies for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates superior performance by effectively combining cross-modal features and addressing modality-specific challenges, offering a promising solution for early Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to address the domain gap problem in monocular depth estimation for surgical scenes by aligning latent features for improved depth accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation in surgical scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining absolute depth from endoscopy cameras, and current domain adaptation methods still exhibit domain gaps.

Method: The approach involves training a depth network to extract latent domain-invariant features using adversarial learning and directional feature consistency, applied to synthetic and real endoscopic video frames.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance in absolute and relative depth estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods, validated on endoscopic videos of central airway phantoms.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces the domain gap in depth estimation, delivering consistent improvements across diverse models and pretrained weights, supporting its efficacy in endoscopic depth estimation tasks.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway

### [86] [Medical Report Generation: A Hierarchical Task Structure-Based Cross-Modal Causal Intervention Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02271)
*Yucheng Song,Yifan Ge,Junhao Li,Zhining Liao,Zhifang Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTSC-CIF, a hierarchical framework for improving automated medical report generation by addressing challenges in domain knowledge, entity alignment, and cross-modal biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical report generation faces challenges in understanding domain knowledge, aligning text-image entities, and overcoming cross-modal biases, limiting reliability and effectiveness.

Method: HTSC-CIF employs hierarchical task decomposition with three components: aligning medical entity features for visual encoder improvement, mutual guidance for text-image alignment via Prefix Language Modeling and Masked Image Modeling, and a causal intervention module to eliminate confounders with front-door intervention.

Result: HTSC-CIF demonstrates superior performance across multiple evaluations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in medical report generation.

Conclusion: HTSC-CIF effectively addresses key challenges in medical report generation, enhancing reliability and interpretability, and paves the way for advanced diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

### [87] [Cycle-Sync: Robust Global Camera Pose Estimation through Enhanced Cycle-Consistent Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02329)
*Shaohan Li,Yunpeng Shi,Gilad Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Cycle-Sync, a novel framework for camera pose estimation, leveraging a robust location solver based on message-passing least squares and cycle consistency principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle inaccuracies and inefficiencies in camera pose estimation, especially concerning robustness and sample complexity, using a global and deterministic approach.

Method: The authors adapt message-passing least squares for camera location and rotation estimation, redefine cycle consistency using distance estimates, employ robust loss functions, integrate outlier rejection, and avoid reliance on bundle adjustment.

Result: Cycle-Sync achieves the strongest deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation while outperforming existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust and efficient solution for camera pose estimation, leveraging cycle consistency and avoiding the limitations of traditional bundle adjustment methods.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

*Giorgos Sfikas,Konstantina Nikolaidou,Foteini Papadopoulou,George Retsinas,Anastasios L. Kesidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using Euler angles for probabilistic 3D object pose estimation through Normalizing Flows modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation is critical in 3D Computer Vision, but deterministic models may fail in cases of ambiguities caused by sensor limitations or object symmetries, necessitating probabilistic approaches.

Method: The authors propose leveraging the Euler angles parameterization within a Normalizing Flows framework to explore its suitability for probabilistic pose estimation.

Result: The study suggests that Euler angles, despite their limitations, offer promise in simplifying model design and achieving effective pose estimation outcomes.

Conclusion: Euler angles, while traditionally seen as challenging due to inherent shortcomings, may prove beneficial within certain model frameworks for 3D pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of crop and weed segmentation for agricultural robots using synthetic data to overcome real-world annotation costs. Using Blender, it generates diverse synthetic datasets and evaluates segmentation models, showing an improved sim-to-real gap and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation costs for real-world agricultural datasets limit the training of deep learning models for crop and weed segmentation.

Method: Creates synthetic crop-weed image datasets using Blender, simulating various environmental factors like growth, density, lighting, and camera angles. Benchmarked segmentation models on these synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Synthetic datasets reduced the sim-to-real gap by 10% and demonstrated superior cross-domain generalization compared to real datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic agricultural datasets facilitate cost-effective training and support hybrid approaches, improving segmentation models' performance and generalization.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

*Fangxun Shu,Yongjie Ye,Yue Liao,Zijian Kang,Weijie Yin,Jiacong Wang,Xiao Liang,Shuicheng Yan,Chao Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning framework enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It uses a dual reward system to improve reasoning quality and adaptiveness in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches often fail to ensure sound reasoning due to reliance on outcome-only supervision and uniform thinking strategies, leading to improper handling of simple and complex tasks.

Method: SAIL-RL introduces a dual reward system: a Thinking Reward to evaluate reasoning on factual and logical grounds, and a Judging Reward to decide between deep reasoning or simple answers.

Result: SAIL-RL improves reasoning benchmarks and multimodal understanding at both 4B and 8B model scales, achieves competitive performance with GPT-4o, and significantly reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: SAIL-RL establishes itself as a reliable framework for enhancing reasoning quality and adapting multimodal large language models, providing a robust solution for better MLLM performance.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the structural recognition of handwritten mathematical expressions by leveraging graph-based models for spatial relationships.

Method: The process begins with segmenting and recognizing symbols and their spatial relations using BLSTM networks to form an initial graph structure. A 2D-CFG parser explores potential relations, followed by a GNN-based link prediction model to refine the graph structure.

Result: Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach, demonstrating strong performance in recognizing HME structures.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based model successfully refines graph-based structures, showing potential to enhance handwritten mathematical expression recognition.

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

TL;DR: The paper presents a system for automated natural language report generation for mobile robotics using local models and edge computing devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective evaluation and acceptance of cognitive robotic systems, particularly in critical tasks such as autonomous driving and service robotics.

Method: A pipeline for automated report generation using multi-modal sensors operating on local models, compatible with edge computing devices for data privacy.

Result: The proposed system is evaluated on a diverse dataset covering indoor, outdoor, and urban settings, offering both quantitative and qualitative results.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the capability to generate effective reports while ensuring data privacy, contributing to acceptance and evaluation of cognitive robotic systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing

*Kun Zou,Yongheng Xu,Jianxing Yu,Yan Pan,Jian Yin,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, GAFD-CC, for improved out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by refining decision boundaries and leveraging correlations between features and logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods fail to consider the correlation between features and logits, which can improve detection accuracy and reliability.

Method: The proposed Global-Aware Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC) aligns features with classification weights to decouple them and extracts correlated features for boundary refinement, fused with multi-scale logit-based confidence for detection.

Result: Through experiments on large-scale benchmarks, GAFD-CC demonstrated competitive performance and strong generalization capabilities, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GAFD-CC effectively addresses limitations in existing methods by leveraging feature-logit correlations, achieving robust OOD detection and improving reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Smartphone-based physiological monitoring is enhanced through dual-view videos and a new dataset, enabling reliable heart-rate detection for cardiovascular patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the accessibility constraints and reliability challenges in smartphone-based physiological monitoring for cardiovascular patients.

Method: The authors introduced the M3PD dataset—dual-view facial and fingertip videos—and developed the F3Mamba model for fusing views and improving heart-rate detection accuracy.

Result: F3Mamba demonstrates 21.9–30.2% error reduction compared to single-view baselines, showcasing robustness in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Dual-view video monitoring combined with the F3Mamba model enhances cardiovascular patient care through reliable and efficient heart-rate detection.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in
challenging real-world scenarios. Data and code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa proposes a novel framework improving vision-language model reasoning by leveraging continuous cross-modal processes for better performance, efficiency, and structured reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current Vision-Language Models constrained by discrete linguistic tokens, bridging the gap between high-dimensional visual perception and rigid language reasoning.

Method: CoCoVa integrates continuous iterative reasoning cycles with a Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) that dynamically refines latent thought vectors using token selection and multi-task objectives for cross-modal grounding.

Result: Experiments show CoCoVa improves performance, competes with or surpasses larger models in benchmarks, with interpretable latent space capturing structured reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: CoCoVa demonstrates its potential to address the gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual cognition, reinforcing efficiency and accuracy in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

TL;DR: The RxnCaption framework improves chemical reaction data parsing by converting it into an image captioning task, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical reaction data often exists as images rather than machine-readable formats, limiting its use in training AI models.

Method: RxnCaption reformulates chemical parsing into an image captioning task. It uses MolYOLO to label molecular structures on images and applies Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) for processing.

Result: The proposed RxnCaption framework shows significant improvements in data extraction accuracy and applies an extensive RxnCaption-11k dataset to achieve state-of-the-art performance metrics.

Conclusion: RxnCaption enhances structured information extraction, facilitating broader AI-driven applications in chemistry. The authors plan to release datasets, models, and code to empower further research.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised approach for moving object segmentation using radar point clouds, addressing their sparsity and noisiness challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve autonomous systems' performance by enabling faster and reliable segmentation of moving objects using radar sensors, overcoming data sparsity and latency in current methods.

Method: Introduces a self-supervised two-step approach: first, contrastive representation learning with a novel clustering-based loss function, followed by supervised fine-tuning with limited labeled data.

Result: The method enhances label efficiency and elevates state-of-the-art performance in radar-based moving object segmentation.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining improves the reliability and effectiveness of moving object segmentation in sparse radar point clouds, aiding autonomous systems.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

*Kuo-Liang Chung,Ting-Chung Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a grouping-based color correction algorithm for point clouds, focusing on improving color consistency through dynamic proximity-based partitioning and specialized correction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of effective color correction algorithms specifically designed for color point clouds, which are crucial for 3D rendering and compression tasks.

Method: The researchers propose a hybrid method that partitions target points into proximity-based groups using an overlapping rate estimation, applying different methods (KBI, JKHE, and HE) for color correction specific to each group.

Result: The algorithm was tested on 1086 color point cloud pairs and demonstrated superior color consistency correction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This novel approach to color correction effectively enhances color consistency in 3D point clouds and stands as an improvement over existing solutions. The source code is made available for further research and application.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study benchmarks representational alignment between cat and human vision across various neural network architectures, finding that self-supervised ViTs yield the best cross-species alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cats and humans have distinct ocular structures, particularly cats' vertically elongated pupils tailored for ambush predation. Understanding how these anatomical differences influence downstream visual representations offers insights into visual computation across species.

Method: The authors designed a benchmark to assess feline-human cross-species representational alignment using neural network architectures, such as CNNs, supervised and self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs), and evaluated using metrics like Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA).

Result: The self-supervised DINO ViT-B/16 achieved the highest cross-species alignment, with early-stage features showing significant representational correspondence. Supervised ViTs and CNNs performed comparably but showed reduced alignment in geometry, while windowed transformers underperformed.

Conclusion: Self-supervised Vision Transformers, with their inherent inductive biases, produce representational geometries that align closely between cat and human visual systems. This work opens avenues for testing neuroscientific hypotheses on shared visual computations.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

### [101] [IllumFlow: Illumination-Adaptive Low-Light Enhancement via Conditional Rectified Flow and Retinex Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02411)
*Wenyang Wei,Yang yang,Xixi Jia,Xiangchu Feng,Weiwei Wang,Renzhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IllumFlow integrates conditional Rectified Flow with Retinex theory to enhance low-light images by optimizing illumination and reflectance separately, achieving superior noise reduction and brightness enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light image enhancement is challenging due to lighting variations and noise, and existing methods struggle to balance these issues effectively.

Method: The method involves decomposing images into illumination and reflectance components using Retinex theory, modeling illumination changes with conditional Rectified Flow, and employing a denoising network for reflectance noise reduction.

Result: IllumFlow demonstrates improved performance in low-light enhancement and exposure correction across various quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses lighting and noise challenges, offering customizable brightness enhancement and superior results compared to previous methods.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

*Duo Xu,Hao Cheng,Xin Lin,Zhen Xie,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline to create datasets for advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in understanding complex charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve MLLMs' ability to handle complex chart scenarios and reasoning tasks.

Method: An automated pipeline integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to systematically generate visual reasoning datasets.

Result: The pipeline produced the ChartM$^3$ dataset, with 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, successfully improving model performance in reasoning and generalization tasks.

Conclusion: The generated dataset enhances smaller MLLM models' capabilities, enabling performance comparable to larger models in complex chart understanding.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

*Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces KAO, a new framework for satellite image inpainting, using Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models to achieve accurate restoration in high-resolution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the restoration accuracy of missing or occluded regions in high-resolution satellite images without extensive retraining or computational overhead.

Method: KAO combines Latent Space Conditioning for optimizing a compact latent space and Explicit Propagation for improved stability and precision in the diffusion process.

Result: KAO achieves superior performance in high-resolution satellite image restoration, setting new benchmarks for datasets like DeepGlobe and the Massachusetts Roads Dataset.

Conclusion: KAO provides a scalable, high-performance solution effectively balancing efficiency and flexibility, addressing key challenges of existing inpainting approaches.

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shotaro Tora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVAFormer, a method for multi-view action recognition in the STAR setting, outperforming baselines by about 4.4 points in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve action recognition when addressing occlusions and leveraging multiple camera views, especially in STAR settings where individual human actions are sequentially identified.

Method: The proposed MVAFormer uses a transformer-based cooperation module among views, focusing on maintaining spatial information through feature maps and separating self-attention for same and different views.

Result: MVAFormer showed approximately 4.4 points improvement on the F-measure over comparison baselines in experiments using a newly collected dataset.

Conclusion: The introduced MVAFormer method is effective in enhancing STAR setting action recognition through improved multi-view cooperation, leveraging its novel module with preserved spatial information.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

TL;DR: OLATverse is a large-scale dataset with 9M images of 765 real-world objects taken under controlled lighting to boost realism in inverse rendering and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between synthetic datasets and real-world applications in inverse rendering, novel view synthesis, and relighting.

Method: OLATverse captures objects with 35 DSLR cameras and 331 controlled lights, provides calibrated parameters, masks, normals, and albedo, enabling diverse illumination conditions.

Result: OLATverse establishes a realistic benchmark for inverse rendering and improves generalization and realism over synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: OLATverse facilitates advancement in next-gen inverse rendering and relighting with its comprehensive real-world dataset.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

*Tao Liu,Kan Ren,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a UAV localization framework using object detection and graph neural networks to handle image matching challenges in GNSS-denied areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of satellite-based localization methods in GNSS-denied areas and the inadequacies of current cross-view localization techniques due to issues like misalignment and content loss.

Method: The framework uses modern object detection for salient instance extraction from UAV and satellite images, and integrates a graph neural network for analyzing inter- and intra-image relationships to achieve accurate matching.

Result: The proposed method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance, effectively handling appearance differences and generalizing well to scenarios like infrared-visible image matching.

Conclusion: This approach represents a significant improvement in UAV localization for GNSS-denied areas, offering robust performance in handling modality gaps with public and real-world datasets.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fire domain lacks datasets with high-quality annotations, limiting advancements in fire-related image-generation and reasoning tasks.

Method: DetectiumFire dataset includes high-resolution fire images, videos, and textual prompts, to facilitate tasks in fire detection, synthetic image generation, and vision-language reasoning.

Result: DetectiumFire outperforms existing datasets in scale, diversity, and quality, and demonstrates its utility across tasks like object detection and diffusion-based image generation.

Conclusion: DetectiumFire promotes advancements in fire-related AI research and supports development of intelligent fire safety systems, available for public use.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at

*Robinson Umeike,Neil Getty,Yin Xiangyu,Yi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PtychoBench, a benchmark to study optimal adaptation strategies for foundation models in microscopy tasks. It compares Supervised Fine-Tuning and In-Context Learning, showing task-specific optimal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve domain adaptation of general-purpose foundation models for specialized scientific tasks in automated microscopy workflows.

Method: Authors introduced the PtychoBench benchmark, evaluating Supervised Fine-Tuning and In-Context Learning using Vision-Language Models and Language Models in visual artifact detection and textual parameter recommendation tasks.

Result: Task-dependent adaptation strategies were identified: SFT and ICL complement each other in visual tasks, while ICL on large base models performs best for textual tasks. Context-aware prompting is superior, and fine-tuned models exhibit contextual interference.

Conclusion: The findings highlight that the optimal adaptation strategy varies by task modality, guiding the development of effective AI systems for scientific applications.

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

*Yaosen Chen,Wei Wang,Xuming Wen,Han Yang,Yanru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an energy-based optimization method for shot assembly in video editing that automates the sequencing of video shots while emulating artistic expression and reference styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of intelligent video editing technologies that can accurately capture creators' unique artistic expressions while automating the process.

Method: The authors propose an energy-based optimization method involving visual-semantic matching with script semantics, shot segmentation, attribute extraction (e.g., shot size, camera motion), and scoring candidate sequences using energy-based models to optimize shot assembly.

Result: The method enables automatic arrangement of shots, adhering to logic, narrative, and artistic styles, as well as learning assembly styles from reference videos.

Conclusion: The approach empowers users, including those with no prior editing experience, to create visually compelling videos that align with artistic and narrative requirements by leveraging an automated system.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

TL;DR: UniChange utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to address limitations in change detection, merging binary and semantic tasks using special tokens and text prompts with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection models are restricted to learning from single-type annotated datasets, limiting their generalization and versatility.

Method: UniChange employs MLLMs with custom tokens ([T1], [T2], [CHANGE]) and text prompts for unified binary and semantic change detection, enabling multi-source dataset integration.

Result: State-of-the-art IoU scores achieved on four public benchmarks: WHU-CD (90.41), S2Looking (53.04), LEVIR-CD+ (78.87), and SECOND (57.62).

Conclusion: UniChange successfully bridges binary and semantic change detection tasks through MLLMs, enhancing generalization, versatility, and performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel introduces a self-tuning pipeline to make sparse-voxel rasterization (SV rasterization) more stable, memory-efficient, and capable of preserving low-frequency content during scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-voxel rasterization often underfits low-frequency content, relies on fragile pruning heuristics, and may result in VRAM inflation, which necessitates steadier and lighter approaches.

Method: The proposed LiteVoxel pipeline includes inverse-Sobel reweighting for low-frequency awareness, depth-quantile pruning with EMA-hysteresis stabilization, and ray-footprint-based priority-driven subdivision under a growth budget.

Result: LiteVoxel mitigates errors in low-frequency regions, improves boundary stability, reduces VRAM usage by ~40%-60%, and maintains comparable PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS to strong SV raster pipelines.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel simplifies and enhances sparse-voxel rasterization by improving memory efficiency, stability, and perceptual quality without compromising training speed or accuracy.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

*Jessica Plassmann,Nicolas Schuler,Georg von Freymann,Michael Schuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines unsupervised deep learning methods for anomaly detection in shearographic images, testing three architectures to enhance industrial inspection without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current shearography methods require expert interpretation, limiting industrial applications. The study aims to replace manual evaluation with automated, unsupervised techniques for detecting subsurface defects.

Method: It explores three unsupervised architectures—fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher model—trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled dataset with reproducible defect patterns was developed under realistic conditions.

Result: The student-teacher model outperformed the autoencoders in robustness and precision for classification and defect localization, with clearer feature separability visualized using t-SNE embeddings.

Conclusion: Unsupervised deep learning has significant potential to streamline shearographic inspection processes in industrial contexts, reducing dependence on labeled data and expert analysis.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

*Kevin Qinghong Lin,Yuhao Zheng,Hangyu Ran,Dantong Zhu,Dongxing Mao,Linjie Li,Philip Torr,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes VCode, a benchmark for visual-centric coding using SVG code to generate symbolic visual representations from images, and introduces VCoder to improve performance in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the underexploration of visual-centric coding compared to language-centric tasks, and the potential of SVG as an interpretable and executable medium for visual representations.

Method: The authors propose the VCode benchmark across three domains, introduce an evaluation protocol named CodeVQA, and develop VCoder, a framework with iterative refinement and visual tool integration to enhance visual coding capabilities.

Result: Frontier vision-language models perform poorly in generating faithful SVGs. VCoder improves performance, achieving a 12.3-point gain over existing models while highlighting the challenges in professional and 3D reasoning.

Conclusion: VCoder and SVG-based benchmarks showcase the untapped potential of symbolic visual representation. There remains a significant gap in visual-centric coding, and VCoder demonstrates possibilities for bridging it.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The UVH-26 dataset, a large-scale traffic-camera image dataset from India, contains 26,646 high-resolution images with 1.8 million vehicle bounding boxes labeled across 14 classes. Models trained on this dataset significantly outperform COCO-trained models for Indian traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets specific to Indian traffic conditions for improving intelligent transportation systems.

Method: The dataset was created using images from 2800 CCTV cameras over four weeks and annotated via a crowdsourced hackathon. Multiple detectors (YOLO, RT-DETR) were trained using this dataset to evaluate performance improvements over the COCO dataset.

Result: Models trained on UVH-26 demonstrated 8.4%-31.5% improvement in mAP50:95 over COCO-trained models for Indian traffic scenarios. RT-DETR-X performed best with an mAP50:95 of 0.67 compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained models.

Conclusion: UVH-26 provides a benchmark for domain-specific vehicle detection in complex Indian traffic conditions, showing significant advantages in model performance. It aids in advancing intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

### [115] [Seeing Across Time and Views: Multi-Temporal Cross-View Learning for Robust Video Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02564)
*Md Rashidunnabi,Kailash A. Hambarde,Vasco Lopes,Joao C. Neves,Hugo Proenca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MTF-CVReID, a modular framework for video-based person re-identification across diverse views using efficient components added to a backbone model, achieving state-of-the-art results without significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in video-based person re-identification for cross-view domains, including viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies.

Method: MTF-CVReID introduces seven specialized modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone, including CSFN, MRFH, IAMM, TDM, IVFA, HTPL, and MVICL, which address biases, scale stabilization, identity traits, temporal encoding, representation alignment, and identity consistency through contrastive learning.

Result: MTF-CVReID achieves real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark, showing strong generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS datasets.

Conclusion: Adapter-based modules significantly improve cross-view robustness and temporal consistency in video-based person re-identification without compromising computational efficiency, offering practical enhancements to existing systems.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

### [116] [A Cognitive Process-Inspired Architecture for Subject-Agnostic Brain Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02565)
*Jingyu Lu,Haonan Wang,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VCFlow, a framework for reconstructing visual experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, addressing difficulties in cross-subject generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in subject-agnostic brain decoding for reconstructing visual experiences using fMRI, making it more viable for clinical applications.

Method: VCFlow models the ventral-dorsal visual system architecture, uses multi-dimensional features, and employs contrastive learning to generalize across subjects for visual reconstruction.

Result: VCFlow reconstructs videos quickly (10 seconds) with only a 7% accuracy tradeoff, requiring significantly less data and computation than conventional methods.

Conclusion: VCFlow provides an efficient and scalable solution for subject-agnostic brain decoding, balancing speed and accuracy for potential clinical use.

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

*Daichi Nagai,Ryugo Morita,Shunsuke Kitada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE introduces a novel zero-shot, layer-wise image generation method using a training-free approach that ensures coherence across layers. This eliminates the need for fine-tuning or large datasets and offers professional-level control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of text-to-image models that generate flat, single-layer images, which hinders their application in professional scenarios demanding layer-wise control. Existing solutions either require inaccessible datasets or fail to produce coherent scenes.

Method: The paper introduces the TAUE framework with the Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC) technique. It extracts latent representations from different generation processes and reuses them for subsequent layers, ensuring a consistent, multi-layered output without fine-tuning.

Result: TAUE achieves results comparable to fine-tuned models in terms of image quality and layer-wise consistency. It eliminates the need for training, making it cost-effective and accessible, while maintaining high fidelity.

Conclusion: The paper establishes TAUE as a viable, training-free alternative for professional layered image generation, enabling applications like compositional editing while ensuring ease of use and high-quality output.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of variability in habitat, motion patterns, and species appearance in multi-animal tracking by leveraging recent advancements in vision foundation models.

Method: A novel tracking framework is proposed that integrates the Grounding Dino object detector with the SAM 2 tracker and uses heuristics for high adaptability across datasets without retraining or hyperparameter adjustment.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated strong and consistent performance on datasets including ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and GMOT-40.

Conclusion: Zero-shot multi-animal tracking using vision foundation models can achieve high performance without the extensive tuning and retraining typically required by traditional approaches.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The
code is available at https://github.com/ecker-lab/SAM2-Animal-Tracking.

*Poulami Raha,Yeongnam Chae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight CNN framework for detecting different face recognition presentation attacks and a novel 2D spoof attack dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are compromised by presentation attacks which exploit vulnerabilities.

Method: Developed a robust CNN framework for identifying print/display, video, and wrap attacks, alongside a 2D spoof dataset with 500+ videos from 60 subjects.

Result: The architecture offers real-time liveness detection with under 2 seconds authentication time on CPU.

Conclusion: The system ensures fast and reliable biometric authentication while effectively mitigating spoofing risks in FR systems.

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniPruneBench, a unified benchmark for evaluating visual token pruning methods in multimodal large language models (LMMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in inference caused by a large number of visual tokens in LMMs and fragmented evaluation of token compression methods.

Method: Developed UniPruneBench, a standardized benchmark covering six ability dimensions, ten datasets, multiple algorithms, and system-level metrics to assess visual token pruning.

Result: Key findings include random pruning as a strong baseline, no universally superior method, varied task sensitivity to pruning, and the critical impact of pruning ratio on performance.

Conclusion: UniPruneBench offers a reliable framework for studying efficient multimodal modeling and provides holistic insights for future research in visual token pruning.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed patch tokens in Vision Transformers, which ignore spatial and semantic image structures.

Method: Introduces an end-to-end differentiable tokenizer using hierarchical model selection with information criteria.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in image classification, dense-prediction tasks, and raster-to-vector conversion.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances image understanding in Vision Transformers while being backward-compatible with pretrained architectures.

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both
image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports
out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

*Chao Yuan,Zanwu Liu,Guiwei Zhang,Haoxuan Xu,Yujian Zhao,Guanglin Niu,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for visible-infrared person re-identification using modality-transition representation learning to align cross-modal features effectively, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the inherent gap between visible and infrared modalities in person re-identification, addressing limitations in existing methods that either rely on intermediate features or fail to fully utilize these features.

Method: The authors propose a modality-transition representation learning framework with a middle-modality image acting as a transition between visible and infrared visual domains. This is paired with a modality-transition contrastive loss and modality-query regularization loss for optimal cross-modal feature alignment, without adding extra parameters.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates the framework surpasses current methods on three benchmark VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves visible-infrared person re-identification performance effectively and efficiently, offering state-of-the-art results without compromising inference speed.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VidEmo models and Emo-CFG dataset for improved video emotion analysis, unifying perception, expression analysis, and understanding in a staged framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in video emotion analysis by addressing the dynamic and cues-dependent properties of emotions.

Method: The approach involves stage-wise unification of attribute perception, expression analysis, and emotional understanding using VidEmo models and extensive tuning techniques like curriculum learning and reinforcement learning.

Result: VidEmo models and Emo-CFG dataset set a performance milestone across 15 face perception tasks, showcasing advanced reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and dataset offer significant advancement and resources for video emotion understanding, enabling improved analysis and instruction-following models.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLEXICORP, a pipeline integrating CRP with multimodal large language models to automate concept naming and explanation generation in CNN analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based AI systems require better understanding of their functionality and decisions for transparency and accessibility. Current CRP workflows are manual and non-scalable.

Method: LLEXICORP couples CRP with large language models to automatically name concept prototypes and create natural-language explanations using crafted prompts.

Result: The pipeline effectively generates both accessible and expert-level explanations for CNN decisions using ImageNet data on a VGG16 model.

Conclusion: LLEXICORP lowers barriers to interpreting CNNs, improving understanding and transparency of AI systems, with potential scalability improvements.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper conducts a comprehensive study on video-text representation alignment, exploring the interplay between modern video and language encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the alignment between video and text representations can provide insights on encoder capabilities, especially for spatio-temporal data.

Method: The study investigates temporal reasoning, semantic alignment, and proposes test-time scaling laws to assess cross-modal alignment and predictive performance.

Result: Cross-modal alignment significantly depends on the richness of video and text data. Strong alignment predicts general-purpose video understanding, raising challenging benchmarks for models.

Conclusion: Video-text representation alignment is a valuable zero-shot methodology for evaluating encoder effectiveness in spatio-temporal contexts, with promising implications for model development.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

*Antonio Oroz,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PercHead introduces a novel approach for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic editing, overcoming challenges in occlusion and weak supervision through a unified model leveraging perceptual supervision and iterative cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing such as view occlusions, perceptual supervision limits, and editing ambiguities in 3D.

Method: The method involves a unified model with a dual-branch encoder and ViT-based decoder utilizing iterative cross-attention for 3D reconstruction. Rendering is done through Gaussian Splatting. A perceptual supervision strategy based on DINOv2 and SAM2.1 ensures geometry and appearance fidelity, while semantic 3D editing is achieved by encoder swapping and fine-tuning.

Result: PercHead achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis, robust handling of extreme viewing angles, and seamless semantic 3D editing capabilities via interactive GUI and distinct input modalities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that PercHead offers an intuitive and powerful solution for 3D reconstruction and editing from single images, combining technical innovation and user-friendly design.

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

### [127] [When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779)
*Yiyang Zhou,Haoqin Tu,Zijun Wang,Zeyu Wang,Niklas Muennighoff,Fan Nie,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Chaorui Deng,Shen Yan,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie,Huaxiu Yao,Qinghao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRA, a benchmark that evaluates reasoning models requiring intermediate visual image generation to solve complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for reasoning lack the inclusion of intermediate visual information, which humans often use to solve intricate problems.

Method: The authors designed tasks for MIRA emphasizing spatial relationships and complex reasoning that demand intermediate visual images. They also developed a standardized evaluation protocol using three levels of input.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that adding visual cues leads to a consistent average performance improvement of 33.7% across models compared to solely relying on textual prompts.

Conclusion: Intermediate visual reasoning plays a critical role in improving performance on complex tasks, and MIRA effectively benchmarks this capability in models.

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

### [128] [AI-Generated Image Detection: An Empirical Study and Future Research Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02791)
*Nusrat Tasnim,Kutub Uddin,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in detecting AI-generated media like deepfakes by introducing a benchmarking framework to evaluate forensic methods systematically, highlighting gaps, variability in generalization, and the need for improved solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing threats from AI-generated media, such as deepfakes, undermine public trust, enable fraud, and harm biometric systems, necessitating more reliable forensic methods.

Method: A unified benchmarking framework was developed to evaluate ten state-of-the-art forensic methods and seven datasets (GAN and diffusion-based) using multiple performance and interpretability metrics.

Result: Findings reveal variability in the generalization of forensic methods, with some showing degraded cross-model transferability despite strong in-distribution performance.

Conclusion: This work aims to advance understanding of forensic limitations and strengths, motivating the development of more robust and explainable forensic methods for security-critical applications.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Conclusion: PLUTO-4 models are promising tools for improving pathology research and diagnostics, showcasing substantial advancements in various pathology-related tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

*Dmitrii Pozdeev,Alexey Artemov,Ananta R. Bhattarai,Artem Sevastopolsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DenseMarks, a novel method using Vision Transformer networks for dense correspondence mapping of human head images to a 3D canonical unit cube, based on contrastive loss and multi-task learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-quality dense correspondences on human head images that are robust to pose variations and span the entire head, including hair.

Method: Training a Vision Transformer network with a dataset of pairwise point matches obtained using a state-of-the-art tracker from talking head videos. Contrastive loss, multi-task learning (landmark and segmentation constraints), and latent space bottleneck ensure embedding consistency.

Result: DenseMarks demonstrates significant improvements in geometry-aware point matching and monocular 3D head tracking, showing robustness to diverse poses and individuals.

Conclusion: DenseMarks provides an interpretable, queryable representation for human head analysis, enabling applications like semantic part discovery, face tracking, and stereo reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Learned Approach to predict throughput in mapping ML models to reconfigurable systems, achieving higher accuracy and performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping ML models onto reconfigurable systems is challenging due to varying throughput and resource constraints across mappings. Accurate throughput evaluation methods are needed without relying on expensive complete measurement processes or error-prone analytical models.

Method: A Learned Approach is introduced to predict throughput, leveraging data-driven techniques to overcome inaccuracies in hand-designed analytical models.

Result: The proposed method achieves 31%-52% more accurate predictions across graphs, no accuracy degradation without performance annotations, and results in compiled graphs that are 5.6% faster.

Conclusion: The Learned Approach enhances accuracy and efficiency in throughput prediction for mapping ML models, demonstrating its potential for optimizing reconfigurable system performance.

Abstract: Mapping a dataflow-graph of an ML model onto a reconfigurable system is
difficult, as different mappings have different throughputs and consume
resource constraints differently. To solve this, a model to evaluate the
throughput of mappings is necessary as measuring throughput completely is
expensive. Many use a hand-designed analytical model, relying on proxy features
or intuition, introducing error. We provide a Learned Approach that predicts
throughput 31%-52% more accurately over a variety of graphs. In addition, our
approach shows no accuracy degradation after removing performance annotations.
We show that using this approach results in 5.6% faster compiled graphs.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the evolution of cloud computing from supporting scientific computing to its central focus on AI/ML, highlighting a misalignment in cost and resource models for scientific users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenge of cloud resource and cost structures being developed primarily for AI/ML, potentially sidelining the needs of scientific computing.

Method: The authors analyze historical trends and current cost models in cloud computing while exploring potential future scenarios and their implications for science.

Result: The study identifies that AI/ML demands dominate cloud innovation, creating barriers for scientific workloads that may force them onto less suitable platforms.

Conclusion: There is a need to reassess cloud cost and resource allocation models to better accommodate scientific computing without impeding AI/ML advancements.

Abstract: Cloud is now the leading software and computing hardware innovator, and is
changing the landscape of compute to one that is optimized for artificial
intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). Computing innovation was initially
driven to meet the needs of scientific computing. As industry and consumer
usage of computing proliferated, there was a shift to satisfy a multipolar
customer base. Demand for AI/ML now dominates modern computing and innovation
has centralized on cloud. As a result, cost and resource models designed to
serve AI/ML use cases are not currently well suited for science. If resource
contention resulting from a unipole consumer makes access to contended
resources harder for scientific users, a likely future is running scientific
workloads where they were not intended. In this article, we discuss the past,
current, and possible futures of cloud cost models for the continued support of
discovery and science.

*Robert Fabian Lindermann,Paul-Niklas Ken Kandora,Simon Caspar Zeller,Adrian Asmund Fessler,Steffen Rebennack*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPHERE, a heuristic routing method for large undirected graphs using subproblem division based on source-target overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high time and memory complexity in shortest-path routing for large, weighted, undirected graphs by finding better heuristic methods.

Method: SPHERE identifies vertices close to both the source (s) and target (t) to partition the problem through a recursive, anchor-based heuristic that works in parallel and integrates seamlessly with existing solvers like Dijkstra.

Result: SPHERE outperforms traditional methods like Louvain-based routing and METIS-based pipelines in runtime, optimality gap, and scalability, even for graphs exceeding a million nodes and edges.

Conclusion: SPHERE offers an efficient and scalable solution for shortest-path routing in large graphs, with improved performance and compatibility with exact solvers.

Abstract: We study shortest-path routing in large weighted, undirected graphs, where
expanding search frontiers raise time and memory costs for exact solvers. We
propose \emph{SPHERE}, a source-target-aware heuristic that identifies an
$s$-$t$ overlap: vertices that are close to both $s$ and $t$ in hop count.
Selecting an anchor $a$ in this overlap partitions the task into two
subproblems with unchanged problem-topology, $s\to a$ and $a\to t$; if either
remains large, the procedure recurses on its induced subgraph. Because the cut
lies inside the overlap, concatenating the resulting subpaths yields a valid
$s\to t$ route without boundary repair. SPHERE is independent of the downstream
solver (e.g., Dijkstra) and exposes parallelism across subproblems. On large
networks, it achieves faster runtimes and smaller optimality gaps than
Louvain-based routing and a METIS-based pipeline, even on graphs with more than
a million nodes and edges, while also outperforming Dijkstra in runtime.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EdgeReasoning, a study focusing on deploying reasoning large language models (LLMs) on edge GPUs to improve latency and optimize accuracy under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge intelligence deployment for autonomous systems faces challenges due to latency and limited computational resources, requiring optimized solutions for reasoning tasks.

Method: The study investigates latency-accuracy tradeoffs, evaluates token length reduction strategies, and profiles test-time scaling methods using varying parallelism levels to optimize edge deployment of reasoning LLMs.

Result: The research systematically maps tradeoffs and guides developers on selecting optimal configurations for reasoning LLMs in edge environments.

Conclusion: Guidance from EdgeReasoning supports effective deployment of large language models on edge GPUs, balancing accuracy and latency to meet resource limitations and performance needs in autonomous systems.

Abstract: Edge intelligence paradigm is increasingly demanded by the emerging
autonomous systems, such as robotics. Beyond ensuring privacy-preserving
operation and resilience in connectivity-limited environments, edge deployment
offers significant energy and cost advantages over cloud-based solutions.
However, deploying large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks on edge
GPUs faces critical challenges from strict latency constraints and limited
computational resources. To navigate these constraints, developers must balance
multiple design factors - choosing reasoning versus non-reasoning
architectures, selecting appropriate model sizes, allocating token budgets, and
applying test-time scaling strategies - to meet target latency and optimize
accuracy. Yet guidance on optimal combinations of these variables remains
scarce. In this work, we present EdgeReasoning, a comprehensive study
characterizing the deployment of reasoning LLMs on edge GPUs. We systematically
quantify latency-accuracy tradeoffs across various LLM architectures and model
sizes. We systematically evaluate prompt-based and model-tuning-based
techniques for reducing reasoning token length while maintaining performance
quality. We further profile test-time scaling methods with varying degrees of
parallelism to maximize accuracy under strict latency budgets. Through these
analyses, EdgeReasoning maps the Pareto frontier of achievable accuracy-latency
configurations, offering systematic guidance for optimal edge deployment of
reasoning LLMs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'HGraphScale', a hierarchical graph neural network-based autoscaling approach for microservice applications in container-based clouds, improving response times significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses challenges in autoscaling microservice applications due to complex dependencies and deployment schemes in container-based cloud environments.

Method: The paper utilizes a hierarchical graph neural network (HGraphScale) to model microservice dependencies and container deployment schemes, enabling adaptive autoscaling based on user workload changes.

Result: Experiments show that HGraphScale reduces average response time by up to 80.16% compared to state-of-the-art solutions while adhering to VM rental budgets.

Conclusion: HGraphScale effectively handles autoscaling for microservice applications in dynamically changing environments, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Microservice architecture has become a dominant paradigm in application
development due to its advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and
resilient. Deploying microservice applications in the container-based cloud
enables fine-grained elastic resource allocation. Autoscaling is an effective
approach to dynamically adjust the resource provisioned to containers. However,
the intricate microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme of the
container-based cloud bring extra challenges of resource scaling. This article
proposes a novel autoscaling approach named HGraphScale. In particular,
HGraphScale captures microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme by a
newly designed hierarchical graph neural network, and makes effective scaling
actions for rapidly changing user requests workloads. Extensive experiments
based on real-world traces of user requests are conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of HGraphScale. The experiment results show that the HGraphScale
outperforms existing state-of-the-art autoscaling approaches by reducing at
most 80.16\% of the average response time under a certain VM rental budget of
application providers.

*Cynthia Marcelino,Thomas Pusztai,Stefan Nastic*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Roadrunner improves performance in WebAssembly-based serverless functions by eliminating serialization and deserialization overhead, achieving near-zero copy data transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serverless computing simplifies infrastructure management, but its reliance on stateless functions and external data storage leads to performance issues stemming from data transfer overhead.

Method: Roadrunner uses a sidecar shim to achieve serialization-free data transfer, leveraging a virtual data hose and memory mapping to reduce data movement and avoid multiple context switches.

Result: Experimental results show that Roadrunner reduces communication latency by 44%-89%, minimizes serialization overhead by 97%, and boosts throughput by 69 times compared to current methods.

Conclusion: Roadrunner significantly enhances inter-function communication, offering near-native latency and improved throughput for serverless systems.

Abstract: Serverless computing provides infrastructure management and elastic
auto-scaling, therefore reducing operational overhead. By design serverless
functions are stateless, which means they typically leverage external remote
services to store and exchange data. Transferring data over a network typically
involves serialization and deserialization. These operations usually require
multiple data copies and transitions between user and kernel space, resulting
in overhead from context switching and memory allocation, contributing
significantly to increased latency and resource consumption. To address these
issues, we present Roadrunner, a sidecar shim that enables near-zero copy and
serialization-free data transfer between WebAssembly-based serverless
functions. Roadrunner reduces the multiple copies between user space and kernel
space by mapping the function memory and moving the data along a dedicated
virtual data hose, bypassing the costly processes of serialization and
deserialization. This approach reduces data movement overhead and context
switching, achieving near-native latency performance for WebAssembly-based
serverless functions. Our experimental results demonstrate that Roadrunner
significantly improves the inter-function communication latency from 44% up to
89%, reducing the serialization overhead in 97% of data transfer, and
increasing throughput by 69 times compared to state-of-the-art
WebAssembly-based serverless functions.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper improves the ADMM-FFT algorithm for laminography reconstruction by introducing the mLR approach, which addresses performance and memory issues with techniques such as memoization, variable offloading, and scalability across GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to overcome the excessive computation time and memory consumption in the ADMM-FFT algorithm, which limits its potential for handling large-scale laminography problems.

Method: The mLR method employs memoization to optimize FFT operations by utilizing the observation of repetitive operations in ADMM-FFT. It also includes variable offloading for memory efficiency and enables scalability across GPUs and nodes.

Result: The mLR approach achieved a 52.8% average performance improvement (up to 65.4%) over ADMM-FFT and allowed the scaling of the algorithm to previously unattainable problem sizes such as 2Kx2Kx2K.

Conclusion: The introduced mLR method improves the scalability and efficiency of ADMM-FFT, enabling it to address larger laminography problems and significantly enhancing its performance while reducing memory constraints.

Abstract: ADMM-FFT is an iterative method with high reconstruction accuracy for
laminography but suffers from excessive computation time and large memory
consumption. We introduce mLR, which employs memoization to replace the
time-consuming Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations based on an unique
observation that similar FFT operations appear in iterations of ADMM-FFT. We
introduce a series of techniques to make the application of memoization to
ADMM-FFT performance-beneficial and scalable. We also introduce variable
offloading to save CPU memory and scale ADMM-FFT across GPUs within and across
nodes. Using mLR, we are able to scale ADMM-FFT on an input problem of
2Kx2Kx2K, which is the largest input problem laminography reconstruction has
ever worked on with the ADMM-FFT solution on limited memory; mLR brings 52.8%
performance improvement on average (up to 65.4%), compared to the original
ADMM-FFT.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Geospatial decentralization is crucial for blockchain robustness, but current Proof of Stake blockchains lack it. The proposed GPoS approach addresses this shortcomings and improves decentralization by 45% with minimal performance overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial dominance in voting power undermines the fairness, resilience, and robustness of blockchain systems, prompting the need for more decentralized models.

Method: Proposed Geospatially aware Proof of Stake (GPoS) integrates geospatial diversity with stake-based voting power and assesses performance using experimental evaluations.

Result: Implemented GPoS improves geospatial decentralization by 45%, evaluated through Gini coefficient of Eigenvector centrality, with negligible consensus performance overhead.

Conclusion: The integration of GPoS can significantly enhance geospatial decentralization of PoS blockchains while maintaining performance efficiency.

Abstract: Geospatial decentralization is essential for blockchains, ensuring regulatory
resilience, robustness, and fairness. We empirically analyze five major Proof
of Stake (PoS) blockchains: Aptos, Avalanche, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui,
revealing that a few geographic regions dominate consensus voting power,
resulting in limited geospatial decentralization. To address this, we propose
Geospatially aware Proof of Stake (GPoS), which integrates geospatial diversity
with stake-based voting power. Experimental evaluation demonstrates an average
45% improvement in geospatial decentralization, as measured by the Gini
coefficient of Eigenvector centrality, while incurring minimal performance
overhead in BFT protocols, including HotStuff and CometBFT. These results
demonstrate that GPoS can improve geospatial decentralization {while, in our
experiments, incurring minimal overhead} to consensus performance.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Large language models face inefficiencies with the conventional bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model in distributed GPU execution. This paper addresses these inefficiencies using fine-grained programming patterns, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance bottlenecks in scaling distributed execution of large language models on GPUs hinder efficiency.

Method: Introduces 'Three Taxes' analytical framework and leverages libraries like Iris for fine-grained programming instead of BSP, enabling tile-level producer-consumer pipelines and fine-grained synchronization.

Result: Achieved 10-20% speedup in end-to-end latency through novel programming patterns applied to key kernels.

Conclusion: Fine-grained programming patterns offer a more efficient and flexible approach than BSP for LLM distributed workloads.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, their workloads
increasingly rely on distributed execution across multiple GPUs. However, the
conventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings
introduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these
bottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel
Data Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We
propose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in
distributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we
gain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of
novel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and
performance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns
systematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level
producer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained
dataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from
the foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the
complex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end
latency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and
efficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an operator-level autoscaling framework for managing resources in large generative models to improve efficiency and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resource management approaches for large generative models treat the model as a monolith, leading to inefficiencies in adapting to dynamic inference traffic.

Method: The framework is based on operator granularity, optimizing scaling, batching, and resource placement, guided by the profiles of individual operators.

Result: The operator-level autoscaling framework achieves up to 40% GPU reduction, 35% energy savings, or 1.6x higher throughput with less energy in production-scale settings.

Conclusion: Operator-based resource management is more effective than model-level provisioning for large generative workloads.

Abstract: Serving large generative models such as LLMs and multi- modal transformers
requires balancing user-facing SLOs (e.g., time-to-first-token,
time-between-tokens) with provider goals of efficiency and cost reduction.
Existing solutions rely on static provisioning or model-level autoscaling, both
of which treat the model as a monolith. This coarse-grained resource management
leads to degraded performance or significant resource underutilization due to
poor adaptability to dynamic inference traffic that is common online.
  The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the internal structure of
generative models: they are executed as graphs of interconnected operators.
Through detailed characterization and systematic analysis, we find that
operators are heterogeneous in their compute and memory footprints and exhibit
diverse sensitivity to workload and resource factors such as batch size,
sequence length, and traffic rate. This heterogeneity suggests that the
operator, rather than the entire model, is the right granularity for scaling
decisions.
  We propose an operator-level autoscaling framework, which allocates resources
at finer (operator)-granularity, optimizing the scaling, batching, and
placement based on individual operator profiles. Evaluated on production-scale
traces, our approach preserves SLOs with up to 40% fewer GPUs and 35% less
energy, or under fixed resources achieves 1.6x higher throughput with 5% less
energy. These results show that the operator, rather than the model, is
fundamentally a more effective unit for scaling large generative workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes two novel algorithms for scheduling tensor contractions in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) to reduce memory usage and improve computation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of optimizing memory and data traffic in tensor contractions during correlation function computations in LQCD on GPUs.

Method: Two fast scheduling algorithms were designed to reorder binary tensor contractions to increase temporal locality and reuse tensors. These algorithms utilize application-specific features to minimize peak memory usage.

Result: The algorithms achieved up to 2.1x reduction in peak memory, up to 4.2x fewer evictions, up to 1.8x reduced data traffic, and up to 1.9x faster computation of correlation functions.

Conclusion: The integration of these scheduling algorithms into the Redstar software significantly improved efficiency in LQCD simulations, making computations faster and more memory-efficient.

Abstract: Computation of correlation functions is a key operation in Lattice quantum
chromodynamics (LQCD) simulations to extract nuclear physics observables. These
functions involve many binary batch tensor contractions, each tensor possibly
occupying hundreds of MBs of memory. Performing these contractions on GPU
accelerators poses the challenge of scheduling them as to optimize tensor reuse
and reduce data traffic. In this work we propose two fast novel scheduling
algorithms that reorder contractions to increase temporal locality via
input/intermediate tensor reuse. Our schedulers take advantage of
application-specific features, such as contractions being binary and locality
within contraction trees, to optimize the objective of minimizing peak memory.
We integrate them into the LQCD analysis software suite Redstar and improve
time-to-solution. Our schedulers attain upto 2.1x improvement in peak memory,
which is reflected by a reduction of upto 4.2x in evictions, upto 1.8x in data
traffic, resulting in upto 1.9x faster correlation function computation time.

*Taisuke Noguchi,Takuya Azumi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper investigates Split Computing to optimize 3D object detection in autonomous driving applications, focusing on reducing inference time and power consumption while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art 3D object detection models for LiDAR data in autonomous driving are computationally intensive, causing higher processing times and power usage on edge devices.

Method: The study employs Split Computing, a distributed inference approach, to shift the computational load and protect data privacy during 3D object detection.

Result: Splitting after voxelization led to a 70.8% reduction in inference time and 90.0% reduction in edge device execution time. Splitting within the network improved inference time by up to 57.1% and edge device execution efficiency by up to 69.5%.

Conclusion: Split Computing effectively reduces computational demands on edge devices, improving inference efficiency and data handling security for 3D point cloud-based object detection.

Abstract: The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep
learning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point
cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for
3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex,
leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge
devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging
Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split
Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby
reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the
risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep
neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after
voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution
time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced
by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.

*Xiumei Deng,Zehui Xiong,Binbin Chen,Dong In Kim,Merouane Debbah,H. Vincent Poor*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents a method called Federated Attention (FedAttn), integrating federated learning into self-attention mechanisms for collaborative large language model inference at the edge, while addressing privacy, communication, and computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practical deployment of large language models in collaborative scenarios at the edge, overcoming challenges such as privacy issues, high communication overhead, and computational inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed method, FedAttn, combines federated learning with self-attention mechanisms. It allows local computation of self-attention and periodic sharing of aggregated Key-Value (KV) matrices to collaboratively generate inferences while protecting privacy and improving computational/communication efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show that FedAttn aligns with theoretical predictions, optimizing response quality while addressing trade-offs between communication/computation efficiency and scalability. Techniques like sparse attention and adaptive KV aggregation further enhance scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: FedAttn provides a robust framework enabling collaborative large language model inference with privacy protection and efficiency improvements, making it suitable for real-world edge deployments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge,
delivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios.
However, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts
fundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and
computational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention
(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention
mechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that
simultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and
computational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local
self-attention over their own token representations while periodically
exchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer
blocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private
prompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual
representation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across
private data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight
provides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated
optimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this
framework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within
participants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error
propagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the
fundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation
efficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of
participants. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis, and
reveal significant optimization opportunities through sparse attention and
adaptive KV aggregation, highlighting FedAttn's potential to deliver
scalability and efficiency in real-world edge deployments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance of four frameworks (Kokkos, OpenMP, RAJA, OCCA) for scientific computing applications on Polaris supercomputer GPUs, detecting variability and optimization needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for frameworks that enable vendor-agnostic performance portability in heterogeneous high-performance computing architectures.

Method: Two scientific computing applications were tested: an N-body simulation and a structured grid simulation, using distributed memory and performance portability frameworks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Result: OCCA showed better performance for small validation problems due to JIT compilation but faced scalability issues; OpenMP struggled in structured grid simulations due to inefficiencies in data communication.

Conclusion: Performance variability among frameworks was identified. Optimization is required in reduction algorithms, communication, and memory management to improve scalability and framework efficiency.

Abstract: Scientific computing in the exascale era demands increased computational
power to solve complex problems across various domains. With the rise of
heterogeneous computing architectures the need for vendor-agnostic, performance
portability frameworks has been highlighted. Libraries like Kokkos have become
essential for enabling high-performance computing applications to execute
efficiently across different hardware platforms with minimal code changes. In
this direction, this paper presents preliminary time-to-solution results for
two representative scientific computing applications: an N-body simulation and
a structured grid simulation. Both applications used a distributed memory
approach and hardware acceleration through four performance portability
frameworks: Kokkos, OpenMP, RAJA, and OCCA. Experiments conducted on a single
node of the Polaris supercomputer using four NVIDIA A100 GPUs revealed
significant performance variability among frameworks. OCCA demonstrated faster
execution times for small-scale validation problems, likely due to JIT
compilation, however its lack of optimized reduction algorithms may limit
scalability for larger simulations while using its out of the box API. OpenMP
performed poorly in the structured grid simulation most likely due to
inefficiencies in inter-node data synchronization and communication. These
findings highlight the need for further optimization to maximize each
framework's capabilities. Future work will focus on enhancing reduction
algorithms, data communication, memory management, as wells as performing
scalability studies, and a comprehensive statistical analysis to evaluate and
compare framework performance.

*Fedor Ryabinin,Alexey Gotsman,Pierre Sutra*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: EPaxos* simplifies and corrects Egalitarian Paxos, offering collaborative command ordering without a single point of failure and with improved fault tolerance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of classical leader-based replication protocols like Paxos, which hinder performance and robustness due to single points of failure and elevated latency.

Method: Propose and rigorously prove a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, generalizing Egalitarian Paxos to work optimally across a range of failure thresholds.

Result: EPaxos* achieves simpler design, correctness, and optimal fault tolerance with throughput maintained despite up to $f$ crashes. It supports faster command execution under certain conditions.

Conclusion: EPaxos* establishes a corrected and generalizable framework for replication protocols, resolving the ambiguity and complexity issues inherent in traditional Egalitarian Paxos.

Abstract: Classical state-machine replication protocols, such as Paxos, rely on a
distinguished leader process to order commands. Unfortunately, this approach
makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for
clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks,
Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows
replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader
allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of
any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any
process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more
than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently
submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in
practical systems.
  Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication
protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously
specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos*
-- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical
contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously
proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the
whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1,
2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.

*Zijian Zhang,Rong Wang,Shiyang Li,Yuebo Luo,Mingyi Hong,Caiwen Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CudaForge, a multi-agent workflow aimed at generating and optimizing CUDA kernels more efficiently, leveraging LLMs like OpenAI-o3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual design of CUDA kernels is time-consuming and costly, while existing automatic methods lack efficiency and generalization. There is a need for a system that combines accuracy, cost-efficiency, and adaptability across varied GPUs and models.

Method: CudaForge employs two iterative LLM agents (Coder and Judge) to generate, test, and enhance CUDA kernels based on hardware feedback using tools like Nsight Compute metrics.

Result: CudaForge outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving 97.6% correctness, significant speedup over PyTorch baselines, and strong generalization across GPUs and LLM base models, while lowering generation time and costs.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, training-free workflows like CudaForge offer a promising avenue for effective, scalable, and economical CUDA kernel optimization, applicable to diverse models and hardware setups.

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95 on the AVEC 2019 dataset.

Conclusion: The developed approach addresses key weaknesses of existing methods and demonstrates enhanced emotional understanding and interpretability in depression detection.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and

### [151] [The Eigenvalues Entropy as a Classifier Evaluation Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01904)
*Doulaye Dembélé*

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of eigenvalues entropy as a new evaluation measure for classifications, especially on imbalanced datasets. It demonstrates its effectiveness over traditional measures with supporting data examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many existing evaluation measures for classification performance struggle to accurately quantify quality in datasets with imbalanced classes. This paper was motivated to address this gap by introducing a more robust measure.

Method: The eigenvalues entropy is proposed and analyzed as an evaluation measure. The study derives relations between eigenvalues and existing measures such as sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and the Gini index. Additionally, the confusion matrix estimation is refined to handle imbalanced classes.

Result: The proposed evaluation measure using eigenvalues entropy performs better than traditional measures on imbalanced datasets, which is illustrated using various examples.

Conclusion: Eigenvalues entropy is an effective alternative evaluation measure for binary and multi-class problems, particularly in addressing imbalanced datasets, and offers better performance than traditional metrics.

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Conclusion: Quantum principles, exemplified by SGD, show potential for enhancing classical optimization techniques; however, challenges like scalability and hardware limitations remain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical

synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated approach to migrate neural network code between frameworks, focusing on PyTorch and TensorFlow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of tailored migration approaches for neural networks increases manual effort and time to modernize NN implementations and ensure compatibility.

Method: The authors propose the use of a pivot NN model to abstract neural networks prior to migration, enabling automated code migration.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates successful migration of code for five neural networks, preserving their functional equivalence.

Conclusion: The proposed approach simplifies neural network migration, addressing challenges between popular frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, with the results validated and artefacts shared online.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear PDEs, which generalizes well across diverse geometries and achieves better accuracy and speed compared to traditional numerical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the efficiency and generalization ability of solution operators for linear PDEs, particularly in cases involving irregular geometries and complex functions where existing methods struggle.

Method: Neural Green's Function uses per-point features extracted from point clouds of the domain to predict a decomposition of the solution operator. This operator is then applied to evaluate solutions numerically, bypassing computationally expensive steps like meshing.

Result: In steady-state thermal analysis on the MCB dataset, Neural Green's Function reduced error by 13.9% on average compared to state-of-the-art neural operators and achieved speed-ups up to 350x compared to traditional numerical solvers.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances generalization and computational efficiency in solving linear PDEs, highlighting Neural Green's Function's potential for handling diverse and complex scenarios efficiently.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

TL;DR: DeepContour integrates deep learning with contour designs for faster solving of Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs), leading to up to 5.63× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GEPs are vital but computationally intensive; contour integral methods struggle with contour selection due to lack of eigenvalue distribution knowledge.

Method: DeepContour uses Fourier Neural Operators for spectral prediction followed by Kernel Density Estimation for principled contour design in contour integral solvers.

Result: DeepContour achieves significant acceleration in solving GEPs, offering up to 5.63× speedup across various scientific datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating deep learning with classical numerical solvers provides efficient and robust handling of large-scale GEPs.

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

TL;DR: Trajectory generation can simulate human mobility behaviors and address privacy, cost, and data quality issues. This research introduces a framework using a diffusion model influenced by population distribution for generating realistic trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like privacy concerns, high cost of data acquisition, and compromised data quality in real-world human trajectory data.

Method: The paper proposes a trajectory generation framework using a diffusion model integrated with dynamic population distribution constraints. It uses spatial graphs and a denoising network to enhance trajectory fidelity and spatial correlations.

Result: Generated trajectories closely match real-world trajectories and outperform existing algorithms by over 54% based on statistical comparisons.

Conclusion: Integrating population distribution into trajectory generation leads to high-fidelity simulations and can greatly improve applications in urban planning, traffic engineering, and public health.

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

*Abdelaziz Bounhar,Hadi Abdine,Evan Dufraisse,Ahmad Chamma,Amr Mohamed,Dani Bouch,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how retaining and slightly emphasizing moderately easy problems during training improves reasoning brevity in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the issue of large language models (LLMs) trained for reasoning becoming excessively verbose, increasing inference cost.

Method: The authors propose retaining and up-weighting moderately easy problems during training as an implicit length regularizer, which exposes models to solvable shorter tasks to constrain output verbosity.

Result: Using this method in RLVR experiments on a specific model yields solutions with baseline accuracy while significantly reducing output length by almost half.

Conclusion: Skillful inclusion of moderately easy tasks leads to emergent brevity in reasoning without explicit length penalization, improving inference cost with retained accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

### [159] [Deciphering Personalization: Towards Fine-Grained Explainability in Natural Language for Personalized Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01932)
*Haoming Wang,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FineXL introduces fine-grained natural language explanations and quantitative scores for personalized image generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized image generation lacks explainability, especially in a detailed, natural language format.

Method: FineXL provides fine-grained explanations and quantitative scoring for various personalization aspects in image generation models.

Result: FineXL improves the accuracy of explainability by 56% across different personalization scenarios and model types.

Conclusion: FineXL enhances detailed comprehension by offering accurate, multi-aspect natural language explanations for model personalization.

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

### [160] [Tool Zero: Training Tool-Augmented LLMs via Pure RL from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01934)
*Yirong Zeng,Xiao Ding,Yutai Hou,Yuxian Wang,Li Du,Juyi Dai,Qiuyang Ding,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Weiwen Liu,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Tool-Zero models, leveraging pure reinforcement learning for LLM tool-use generalization, achieving superior performance and reasoning capability improvements over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods relying on supervised fine-tuning struggle with generalizing LLMs to unfamiliar tool-use scenarios, highlighting a need for enhanced reasoning and generalization approaches.

Method: The authors propose a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based reinforcement learning, shifting rewards progressively from exploration to exploitation to train Tool-Zero models starting from base LLMs.

Result: Experimental findings reveal over 7% improvement in performance compared to models trained via supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning with fine-tuning, exhibiting robust results across diverse evaluations.

Conclusion: Pure RL can effectively enhance LLMs' reasoning and tool-agnostic generalization, addressing complexities in tool-utilization scenarios while outperforming traditional training methods.

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

*Xuheng Li,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FGTS-VA, a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with a general reward function, achieving an optimal variance-dependent regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in studying variance-dependent regret bounds for sampling-based contextual bandit algorithms, specifically improving upon LinVDTS' limitations for general reward functions.

Method: The authors propose the FGTS-VA algorithm, leveraging an extended decoupling coefficient to analyze variance-dependent regret bounds in contextual bandits.

Result: FGTS-VA achieves a regret bound of approximately $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$, matching UCB-based algorithms in linear bandit settings.

Conclusion: FGTS-VA is an effective variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits, offering optimal performance with a general reward function.

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

*Hasan Tutar,Caner Erden,Ümit Şentürk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops a systematic model based on machine learning to objectively determine sample size in qualitative research, traditionally reliant on subjective principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies and methodological concerns in determining sample sizes for qualitative research and enhance transparency using machine learning techniques.

Method: An ensemble learning model is developed using ten parameters from five qualitative research approaches, applying ML algorithms such as KNN, GB, RF, XGBoost, and DT, with outlier removal and feature importance analysis.

Result: Achieved high explanatory power (Test R2 ~ 0.85) for algorithms modeling qualitative sampling decisions, validating theoretical assumptions quantitatively.

Conclusion: The study proposes a computational framework for a decision support system, aiming to standardize sample size justification, improve transparency, and promote evidence-based decision-making in qualitative research.

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

### [163] [Probabilistic Graph Cuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02272)
*Ayoub Ghriss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new probabilistic framework for differentiable graph partitioning, applicable to a wide class of cuts, providing analytical upper bounds and facilitating scalable learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of prior probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts, such as lack of guarantees and principled gradients, while covering a broader range of cuts like Normalized Cut.

Method: The approach utilizes a unified probabilistic framework, employing integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions to derive tight analytic upper bounds and closed-form gradients for graph partitioning.

Result: The framework offers a general, mathematically rigorous, and scalable foundation for graph partitioning in clustering and contrastive learning, with stable, differentiable formulations.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances differentiable graph partitioning by enabling broader applications, improving numerical stability, and ensuring analytical precision in results.

Abstract: Probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts offer a differentiable alternative to
spectral clustering, enabling end-to-end and online learning without
eigendecompositions, yet prior work centered on RatioCut and lacked general
guarantees and principled gradients. We present a unified probabilistic
framework that covers a wide class of cuts, including Normalized Cut. Our
framework provides tight analytic upper bounds on expected discrete cuts via
integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions with closed-form
forward and backward. Together, these results deliver a rigorous, numerically
stable foundation for scalable, differentiable graph partitioning covering a
wide range of clustering and contrastive learning objectives.

*Tiberiu Musat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the grokking phenomenon where generalization emerges substantially after memorization in neural networks, providing explanations using constrained optimization and validating through theoretical analysis and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the dynamics underlying grokking, particularly the mechanisms enabling delayed generalization after data memorization in neural networks.

Method: The authors approach this through constrained optimization, formally proving dynamics on the zero-loss manifold and introducing an approximation to decouple parameter learning. They derive closed-form dynamics for a specific layer in a two-layer network and validate results via experiments.

Result: The study identifies the dynamics of grokking as processes that minimize weight norm after memorization, supporting findings with theoretical proofs and simulations that replicate delayed generalization and representation learning.

Conclusion: Grokking can be understood in terms of constrained optimization dynamics, and this understanding is supported by theoretical derivations and experimentally validated insights into neural network behavior after data memorization.

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

### [165] [Reducing normalizing flow complexity for MCMC preconditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02345)
*David Nabergoj,Erik Štrumbelj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new preconditioning architecture combining linear components and conditional normalizing flows (NFs) to improve sampling efficiency in MCMC algorithms, achieving better results on complex distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing MCMC preconditioning methods, particularly nonlinear preconditioners that often require overparameterization and lack adaptability to target distributions.

Method: Proposes a factorized preconditioning architecture combining linear and conditional normalizing flow components. The linear preconditioner handles approximately Gaussian dimensions, while conditional NFs address more complex dimensions, estimated through warmup samples.

Result: The method yields better tail samples, consistently improves performance across sparse logistic regression and hierarchical Bayesian posterior analyses, and achieves higher effective sample sizes in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances MCMC sampling efficiency, particularly in challenging hierarchical Bayesian models with limited data, by reducing NF complexity and adapting to target geometries, offering insights into neural MCMC design.

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

*Guillaume Tejedor,Veronika Peralta,Nicolas Labroche,Patrick Marcel,Hélène Blasco,Hugo Alarcan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a clustering methodology for ALS patient sequences based on disease progression scores, outperforming existing methods in survival analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in ALS research like variable patient responses, small cohorts, sparse data, and lack of precise clustering methods to improve personalized care.

Method: The approach integrates medical expertise via descriptive variables, distance measures (off-the-shelf and weak-supervised learning), pairs them with clustering methods, and benchmarks against existing techniques.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering techniques in survival analysis and produces interpretable results evaluated on 353 ALS patients.

Conclusion: Proposed clustering improves survival prediction and aids medical experts in better understanding ALS progression through enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces COFAP, a deep-learning-based framework for predicting gas adsorption in COFs, eliminating reliance on time-intensive gas-related features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies and labor-intensive processes in identifying optimal Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) for gas adsorption and separation.

Method: The COFAP framework uses deep learning to extract multi-modal structural and chemical features, fusing them via a cross-modal attention mechanism.

Result: COFAP achieved state-of-the-art performance on the hypoCOFs dataset without relying on Henry coefficients or adsorption heat. It also identified key structural ranges for optimal COF performance.

Conclusion: COFAP enhances efficiency and accuracy in predicting optimal COFs, providing a scalable solution that can be used directly to analyze crystalline porous materials.

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a predictive model combining tree-based methods and CNN for cardiovascular disease risk, achieving significant improvement in performance with strong interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease continues to be a major global health problem requiring reliable predictive tools for early risk detection.

Method: The study used an ensemble model of LightGBM, XGBoost, and CNN trained on a dataset of 229,781 patients with class imbalance addressed through strategic weighting and feature engineering.

Result: The proposed model achieved a Test AUC of 0.8371 (p=0.003) and a recall of 80%, outperforming individual models.

Conclusion: This study offers a strategic ensemble model blending predictive accuracy and interpretability, suitable for real-world public health applications.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

*Prasanth K K,Shubham Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Standard RNNs, including LSTMs, fail to capture long-range dependencies in noisy data. The EchoLSTM, using Output-Conditioned Gating, addresses this and achieves better performance and efficiency on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability of RNNs like LSTMs to model long-range dependencies, especially in noisy or misleading information sequences.

Method: Introduce the Output-Conditioned Gating mechanism, allowing the model to adapt internal memory gates based on prior inferences, and integrate it with attention to design the EchoLSTM model.

Result: EchoLSTM showed 69.0% accuracy on a custom Distractor Signal Task, outperforming LSTMs by 33 points, and competitive performance on ListOps compared to Transformers, using over 5 times fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The EchoLSTM model offers robust memory retention and efficiency, demonstrating the utility of Output-Conditioned Gating for improving RNNs in handling complex, noisy sequences.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

*Lejs Deen Behric,Liang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConMeZO, a zeroth-order optimizer, improves convergence for finetuning large language models by adaptive directional sampling, significantly reducing optimization time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing large language models with conventional methods faces challenges like slow convergence and high memory demands, particularly using zeroth-order methods due to dimensionality issues.

Method: The proposed ConMeZO restricts sampling directions to a cone centered around a momentum estimate, focusing on likely gradient directions to improve convergence efficiency.

Result: ConMeZO reduces convergence time by up to 2X compared to traditional zeroth-order methods while maintaining a low-memory footprint.

Conclusion: ConMeZO effectively addresses slow convergence in zeroth-order optimization for LLMs by introducing adaptive sampling, making it a practical choice for resource-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

*Manuel A. Hernandez Alonso,Michael Depass,Stephan Quessy,Numa Dancause,Ignasi Cos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroClean is an unsupervised preprocessing method for EEG/LFP signals that efficiently removes artifacts and improves machine learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for automated conditioning of EEG and LFP recordings due to heavy artifact contamination and increasing volumes of data.

Method: The NeuroClean pipeline is a five-step procedure incorporating filtering, bad channel rejection, independent component analysis, and automatic component rejection using clustering algorithms.

Result: NeuroClean reliably removed common artifacts and yielded over 97% accuracy using cleaned data in motor tasks, outperforming raw data accuracy of 74%.

Conclusion: NeuroClean demonstrates strong potential to improve data quality and generalization in machine learning models for EEG/LFP studies.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

*Rathin Chandra Shit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new continual learning framework addressing catastrophic forgetting by combining NTK theory, statistical validation, and path quality evaluation, achieving competitive results on Split-CIFAR10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, where neural networks lose prior knowledge when learning new tasks.

Method: A path-coordinated framework leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for plasticity bounds, Wilson confidence intervals for statistical validation, and multiple metrics for path quality evaluation.

Result: Achieved 66.7% average accuracy with 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, reduced forgetting rates over tasks, and demonstrated NTK condition numbers as indicators of learning capacity.

Conclusion: The study offers a competitive framework for mitigating forgetting in continual learning, providing stability and actionable insights for adaptive regularization.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

*Donghee Lee,Hye-Sung Lee,Jaeok Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a bulk-boundary decomposition framework to analyze deep neural network training and develops a field-theoretic formulation based on this decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the training dynamics of deep neural networks by systematically separating intrinsic dynamics from stochastic interactions.

Method: They reorganized the stochastic gradient descent formulation into two components: a bulk term representing intrinsic network dynamics and a boundary term reflecting stochastic sample interactions.

Result: The decomposition reveals a local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks and enables the development of a field-theoretic formulation for neural dynamics.

Conclusion: This framework provides insights into the mathematical structure of deep network dynamics, paving the way for advanced theoretical formulations.

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

*Duc A. Tran,Dung Truong,Duy Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes RobustFSM, a solution to make federated submodular maximization robust against malicious client attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in federated optimization due to client misbehaviors like backdoor attacks, while respecting privacy and autonomy.

Method: Develop and evaluate RobustFSM, a federated submodular maximization approach resistant to client attacks.

Result: Empirical study shows RobustFSM improves solution quality up to 200% under severe attacks.

Conclusion: RobustFSM is effective in enhancing robustness in federated submodular optimization under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine
learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an
extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are
locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the
quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of
local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to
respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is
vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake
information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning,
but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of
submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular
maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its
performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using
real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of
RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm
when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset
and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

### [175] [TapOut: A Bandit-Based Approach to Dynamic Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02017)
*Aditya Sridhar,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TapOut, a plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculative decoding in LLMs, improving efficiency by eliminating hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize speculative decoding in LLMs by dynamically determining the number of tokens to draft. Existing approaches rely on hand-tuned thresholds, which are inefficient and not generalizable.

Method: The proposed method is TapOut, an online training-free algorithm using multi-armed bandits for speculative policy selection, applying a meta-algorithm based on past rewards and exploration.

Result: TapOut shows competitive or better speedups than baseline methods in experiments with diverse model pairs and datasets, requiring no hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: TapOut is effective for dynamic speculative decoding, offering a plug-and-play solution with high speedups and broader applicability across models and domains.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

### [176] [Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Rare Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02042)
*M. Z. Haider,M. U. Ghouri,Tayyaba Noreen,M. Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum model to improve the modeling of rare events, overcoming limitations of classical generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events in areas like finance, climate, and biology exhibit scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions, making them hard to model accurately.

Method: QEGM integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits using a hybrid loss function and quantum randomness-driven noise for enhanced sample diversity. Classical and quantum parameters are optimized iteratively in training.

Result: QEGM significantly improves performance on rare-event modeling, reducing tail KL divergence by up to 50% compared to GAN, VAE, and Diffusion baselines. It also enhances recall and coverage calibration.

Conclusion: QEGM offers a robust framework for predicting rare events, leveraging quantum-enhanced methods to address classical modeling limitations.

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

### [177] [Shared Parameter Subspaces and Cross-Task Linearity in Emergently Misaligned Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02022)
*Daniel Aarao Reis Arturi,Eric Zhang,Andrew Ansah,Kevin Zhu,Ashwinee Panda,Aishwarya Balwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers adopt a geometric perspective to explore the phenomenon of emergent misalignment (EM) in large language models and find cross-task linear structures in harmful behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind emergent misalignment in large language models and exploring its harmful generalization across different domains.

Method: The study examines EM parameters using cross-task convergence, cosine similarities, principal angles, projection overlaps, and linear mode connectivity models.

Result: The study reveals that EM arises from narrow tasks discovering shared parameter directions, with harmful behaviors organized into predictable regions of the weight landscape.

Conclusion: This geometric perspective on EM mechanisms provides insights for advancing parameter space interpretability and developing weight-based interventions to address aligned behavior.

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

### [178] [Predicting Microbial Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02038)
*Elham Gholamzadeh,Kajal Singla,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach to predict microbial interactions, achieving better performance than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding interspecies interactions in microbial ecology is essential for deciphering microbial community structures and functions.

Method: The authors used Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to classify microbial interactions using data on monoculture growth, species interactions, phylogeny, and pairwise interaction datasets.

Result: The GNN-based model achieved an F1-score of 80.44%, outperforming existing methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which achieved 72.76%.

Conclusion: The GNN approach is a promising tool for predicting complex microbial interaction types beyond binary classifications.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

### [179] [Flashlight: PyTorch Compiler Extensions to Accelerate Attention Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02043)
*Bozhi You,Irene Wang,Zelal Su Mustafaoglu,Abhinav Jangda,Angélica Moreira,Roshan Dathathri,Divya Mahajan,Keshav Pingali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flashlight, a framework for automatically generating fused kernels for attention-based models in PyTorch, surpassing existing methods in flexibility and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient implementation of attention mechanisms in large language models is challenging, especially for customized or specialized variants that often require tailored kernels.

Method: Flashlight uses a compiler-native approach within PyTorch to transparently generate efficient, fused, and tiled attention kernels without relying on static templates or pre-defined implementations.

Result: Flashlight demonstrates superior or competitive performance to FlexAttention while supporting a wider range of attention models, including general and data-dependent formulations.

Conclusion: Flashlight combines efficiency and flexibility, enabling developers to experiment with diverse attention model designs within the PyTorch ecosystem without compromising performance.

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

*Vivswan Shah,Randy Cogill,Hanwei Yue,Gopinath Chennupati,Rinat Khaziev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by attaching brief explanations to labels during training, showing it improves accuracy compared to label-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether adding explanations alongside labels during fine-tuning of LLMs enhances model performance in conversational classification tasks.

Method: Fine-tune a 7B-parameter LLM on multiple datasets using both label-plus-explanation and label-only approaches, incorporating random pseudo-explanations to test the impact of non-semantic additional tokens.

Result: Explanation-augmented fine-tuning significantly outperforms label-only methods across diverse datasets, with even random pseudo-explanations improving accuracy by encouraging richer computation and reducing over-confidence.

Conclusion: Adding explanations, even without meaningful semantics, enhances the reliability and accuracy of LLM classifications by influencing intermediate computations and reducing shortcuts during inference.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

### [181] [A Dual-Use Framework for Clinical Gait Analysis: Attention-Based Sensor Optimization and Automated Dataset Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02047)
*Hamidreza Sadeghsalehi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework to address dataset bias and optimize wearable sensor configurations for gait analysis in neurological and orthopedic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of dataset biases and optimizing task-specific wearable sensors in gait analysis for managing conditions like Parkinson's disease (PD), osteoarthritis (OA), and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA).

Method: The authors propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning model that serves both as a tool for optimizing sensor selection and as an automated dataset auditing mechanism.

Result: The model uncovered a significant dataset bias in gait data, particularly a laterality bias in right-sided data for OA and CVA tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness as an auditing tool. It also identified new sensor combinations for optimized protocols.

Conclusion: The framework not only identifies and quantifies biases in datasets but also hints towards sensor arrangements for future optimized clinical assessments.

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

*Nimrod Megiddo,Segev Wasserkrug,Orit Davidovich,Shimrit Shtern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a solver for optimizing binary variable functions using a novel algorithm based on learning from sub-instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop an efficient solver for maximizing real-valued functions of binary variables without relying on solved instances or policy values.

Method: The proposed algorithm estimates optimal objective values using sub-instance distributions. Training the estimator uses an inequality-based expected deviation loss function instead of objective-function calculations.

Result: The solver avoids reliance on solved instances or policy evaluations by leveraging a unique training approach with sub-instance analyses.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising solution for optimization problems involving binary variables, with a novel method focusing on sub-instances rather than traditional policy evaluations.

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

*Jucheng Shen,Yeonju Ro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT) for faster and more accurate decoding in masked diffusion language models (MDLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding in MDLMs is typically constrained by fixed steps and sequential unmasking, slowing down performance. Confidence fluctuations and repetitive trajectories across inputs motivated a need for dynamic and reusable thresholds.

Method: OSDT dynamically calibrates confidence thresholds on a single sequence and applies them to other inputs, offering an efficient decoding method without substantial overhead.

Result: OSDT improves accuracy-throughput trade-offs across various benchmarks, achieving up to 50% faster decoding with modest or negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: This method highlights the potential for leveraging confidence signatures to improve algorithms and systems for diffusion decoding in more general contexts.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their
autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and
sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM
enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we
observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a
dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by
cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot
Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence
and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K,
and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24%
tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy,
and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our
findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level
confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems
innovations in diffusion decoding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study revisits the unsupervised Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) probing method to clarify its mechanisms and reformulate it for better applicability, introducing an eigenproblem-based approach providing closed-form, interpretable solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the understanding and functionality of CCS for probing binary features in large language models by addressing its partially understood mechanisms and sensitivity to initialization.

Method: The paper reformulates CCS as an eigenproblem, which leads to closed-form solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and enables natural extensions to handle multiple variables more effectively.

Result: The proposed method recovered similar performance to original CCS across datasets while resolving issues like sensitivity to random initialization.

Conclusion: Relativizing contrast consistency enhances understanding and utility of CCS, broadening potential applications for probing and interpretability in language models.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for incorporating physical knowledge into the loss function of machine learning models, improving prediction and generative modeling tasks by leveraging energy-based solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively utilize prior physical knowledge in machine learning applications within scientific domains, overcoming limitations of architectural-level approaches.

Method: Developing energy-based loss functions derived using reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution. These leverage thermal equilibrium assumptions of data samples, yielding physically meaningful and efficient loss functions.

Result: The proposed method effectively improves molecular generation and spin ground-state predictions, outperforming baseline approaches.

Conclusion: This framework provides an architecture-agnostic, computationally efficient, and physically sound modeling solution that aligns with the physics of the system and respects symmetries.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

*Lancelot Da Costa,Sanjeev Namjoshi,Mohammed Abbas Ansari,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a standardized framework for structured world models using discreet and continuous processes, aiming at improving modularity, performance, and interpretability while identifying scalability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of world modeling lacks standardization, with siloed architectures not building upon each other. This hinders progress towards unified and efficient frameworks.

Method: The authors present a modular hierarchical framework using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching linear dynamical systems (sLDS) to integrate discrete, continuous processes and augment them for control tasks.

Result: The modular approach achieves competitive performance compared to neural models in multimodal generative modeling and planning, all while retaining interpretability.

Conclusion: Addressing the scalability of joint structure-parameter learning remains a challenge, but solving it could lay the groundwork for standardized foundational infrastructure in world modeling.

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper applies online learning techniques to adapt to non-stationary data streams in fusion applications, achieving significant error reductions in predictions for TF coil deflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fusion data exhibits non-stationary behavior due to experimental evolution and machine wear, challenging traditional stationary ML models. Online learning methods can address these data drifts, but they remain underexplored in fusion applications.

Method: The paper implements online learning and proposes an uncertainty-guided online ensemble method using Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) for uncertainty estimation in predictions. This ensemble approach leverages varying historical data horizons for improved model performance.

Result: The online learning approach reduced prediction errors by 80% compared to static models. Additionally, the uncertainty-guided online ensemble method achieved further improvements, reducing errors by 10% compared to traditional online learning.

Conclusion: Online learning is vital for handling fusion data's non-stationary nature. Combining uncertainty estimation with ensemble methods can significantly enhance prediction accuracy and maintain model performance over time.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric alternative for efficient Shapley data valuation based on statistical leverage scores, suitable for large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational infeasibility of traditional Shapley data valuation due to its combinatorial nature when applied at scale.

Method: Introduced statistical leverage scores and ridge leverage scores as a computationally feasible way to evaluate individual datapoints, adhering to Shapley axioms and relevant statistical criteria.

Result: Provided theoretical and empirical evidence showing that leverage-sampled subsets achieve near-optimal models and enhance downstream decision quality.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, practical framework for data valuation while achieving competitive performance in active learning experiments.

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

### [189] [Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Earth Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02101)
*Arjun Rao,Marc Rußwurm,Konstantin Klemmer,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study investigates the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and examines how they encode Earth's data into compact, high-dimensional representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of information content in geographic INRs and how this information is distributed within representations.

Method: Analyzed geographic INRs with ambient dimensions between 256 and 512, focusing on their intrinsic dimensions, which measure degrees of freedom in data.

Result: Found intrinsic dimensions of geographic INRs range between 2 and 10 and are influenced by factors like spatial resolution and input modalities. These dimensions also correlate with downstream task performance.

Conclusion: The intrinsic dimension provides a label-free, architecture-agnostic metric for evaluating the effectiveness, diagnosing spatial artifacts, and guiding design in geographic INR models.

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

*Xinyuan Song,Jiaye Teng,Ziye Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of loss function choices on robustness and optimization, using noisy matrix sensing as a study case. A nonparametric, kernel-based regression approach is proposed, outperforming traditional MSE under diverse noise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean squared error is unreliable for non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise, motivating a need for improved robustness in loss functions for effective regression under diverse noise distributions.

Method: A robust loss function based on nonparametric regression using kernel density estimation is utilized, analyzing its optimization landscape and restricted isometry property (RIP) constants.

Result: The robust loss enhances handling of large noise and remains stable across diverse distributions, demonstrated through theoretical and empirical analysis.

Conclusion: Changing the loss function can significantly improve robustness in machine learning tasks, providing a broadly applicable framework for better optimization landscapes.

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical CNN for classifying cardiac abnormalities using compact 2D image representations derived from 1D phonocardiogram signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cardiac diseases requires identifying abnormal heart sound patterns efficiently and accurately.

Method: A QCNN architecture is used, where one-dimensional phonocardiogram signals are converted into 8-pixel 2D images via wavelet feature extraction and adaptive compression methods, then processed by quantum computing.

Result: The QCNN achieves high classification accuracy of 93.33% on the test set and 97.14% on the train set using the HLS-CMDS dataset.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that quantum models can effectively process heart sound signals, paving the way for quantum-assisted diagnostic tools in healthcare.

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

TL;DR: CausalDDS, a novel framework, improves drug synergy prediction by focusing on causal structures over spurious features, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing effective combination therapies for complex diseases like cancer is hindered by black-box synergy predictors that rely on statistical correlations without interpretability.

Method: CausalDDS disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious substructures, utilizing causal representations, conditioned interventions, and novel optimization objectives based on sufficiency and independence.

Result: Experiments show CausalDDS outperforms baseline models, especially in cold start and out-of-distribution settings, while providing molecular insights into drug synergy.

Conclusion: CausalDDS successfully enhances drug synergy prediction with improved accuracy, interpretability, and potential as a practical drug discovery tool.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

*Abdullah Almansour,Ozan Tonguz*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models perform well in controlled environments but often fail in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, creating challenges in sensitive applications.

Method: The paper introduces Characteristic Function as a frequency domain approach for measuring and addressing distribution shifts in high-dimensional spaces.

Result: Using CF is demonstrated as a viable alternative to existing statistical methods for quantifying distribution shifts and assisting in domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Characteristic Function offers a robust method for tackling distribution shift challenges in ML, pushing forward domain adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

TL;DR: The study introduces ProtoTSNet, an approach aimed at interpretable classification of multivariate time series by enhancing the ProtoPNet architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results on explainable methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable algorithms in fields such as industry and medicine, where time series data plays a significant role and decisions have critical consequences.

Result: ProtoTSNet outperformed other explainable methods and achieved competitive results compared to non-explainable and post-hoc explainable models across 30 datasets.

Conclusion: ProtoTSNet effectively combines interpretability and competitive performance in multivariate time series classification, making its results accessible to domain experts.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

*Yuzhuang Pian,Taiyu Wang,Shiqi Zhang,Rui Xu,Yonghong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CGLUBNF, a framework for enhancing air quality predictions with incomplete data, outperforming several baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable air quality prediction is hindered by incomplete spatiotemporal data from issues in data collection and transmission.

Method: The CGLUBNF framework integrates Fourier features, graph attention encoders, and a channel-gated learning unit with Bayesian inference to address missing data and enhance prediction accuracy.

Result: CGLUBNF demonstrates higher accuracy and more precise confidence intervals across various datasets and missing data scenarios compared to five state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for spatiotemporal forecasting in scenarios with incomplete data and proves robust for emerging sensing technologies like mobile monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

*Kevin Valencia,Thilina Balasooriya,Xihaier Luo,Shinjae Yoo,David Keetae Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes OmniField, a robust model for multimodal spatiotemporal learning capable of addressing sparsity and noise in data, and adapting to varied data modalities, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multimodal spatiotemporal learning where data is sparse, irregular, noisy, and variable across time and space, thus limiting traditional models' usability.

Method: OmniField is introduced as a framework that uses a continuous neural field conditioned on available modalities and employs iterative cross-modal refinement through a multimodal crosstalk block architecture.

Result: OmniField outperforms eight strong baselines in spatiotemporal tasks and maintains performance even under heavy simulated sensor noise, showing its robustness.

Conclusion: OmniField provides unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction in spatiotemporal contexts, solving key challenges through its adaptive and robust framework.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

### [197] [Learning Interactive World Model for Object-Centric Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02225)
*Fan Feng,Phillip Lippe,Sara Magliacane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIOC-WM, an object-centric RL framework that captures both object representations and interactions to enhance robust policy learning and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods primarily focus on individual objects without explicitly modeling interactions, limiting robustness and generalization in policy learning.

Method: FIOC-WM learns disentangled representations of objects and interactions using pre-trained vision encoders and hierarchical policies, with tasks modeled as composable interaction primitives.

Result: FIOC-WM achieves improved sample efficiency and generalization in policy learning across simulated robotic and embodied AI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of objects and interactions in RL world models is essential to improve robustness, efficiency, and generalization in policy learning.

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The research improves latency in Mixture-of-Experts architectures for language models by introducing dynamic routing methods that reduce token-to-expert mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts architectures struggle with latency during autoregressive generation due to inefficient token-to-expert mapping in memory-bound regimes.

Method: Dynamic re-routing techniques, including batch-aware routing, are implemented to optimize token-to-expert mapping and lower decode latency.

Result: The approach reduces MoE layer decode latency by 39% and 15% for Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models, respectively, without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: By employing efficient routing strategies, the study offers significant latency improvements in MoE architectures while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on subtraction in large language models (LLMs), revealing that subtraction accuracy is significantly lower than addition, especially for cases where the result is negative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtraction, as a non-commutative operation, has received less attention in arithmetic benchmarks for LLMs compared to addition and multiplication. Understanding its performance can highlight gaps in LLM arithmetic capabilities.

Method: The study evaluates subtraction versus addition performance across eight pretrained LLMs from four model families. Errors in subtraction cases and their correlation to whether ($a<b$) are analyzed, along with probing studies and tests on few-shot learning and instruction tuning.

Result: Subtraction accuracy lags significantly behind addition accuracy, and errors occur mainly when the result should be negative due to omission of the negative sign. Few-shot learning offers small improvements, while instruction-tuning achieves near-perfect results in generating the negative sign.

Conclusion: LLMs internally encode information about negative results but fail to represent it in outputs without instruction-tuning. Instruction-tuning significantly improves subtraction performance and highlights recoverability in LLM arithmetic shortcomings.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

*Hikaru Homma,Jun Ohkubo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neural network initialization framework using spectral bias to improve training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how to utilize the spectral bias characteristic of neural networks during initialization to enhance learning and avoid reliance on extensive backpropagation.

Method: The proposed framework modifies scale factors in the SWIM algorithm to represent low-frequency components in early layers and high-frequency components in later layers.

Result: Numerical experiments on regression and classification tasks (MNIST) show that the method outperformed conventional initialization approaches.

Conclusion: Exploiting spectral bias in initialization improves learning efficiency, offering a novel and effective strategy for neural network parameter initialization.

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRACE is a lightweight method for selecting the optimal teacher model for efficient knowledge distillation without requiring teacher internals, logits, or test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the best teacher model for student-task combinations in knowledge distillation is resource-intensive due to trial-and-error processes.

Method: GRACE evaluates the effectiveness of a teacher based on distributional properties of the student's gradients, aligning with information theory principles to predict generalization quality.

Result: On GSM8K and MATH tasks, GRACE demonstrates up to 86% Spearman correlation with distilled student model performance and improves student performance by 7.4% over default teacher selection.

Conclusion: GRACE streamlines knowledge distillation by efficiently identifying the most suitable teacher and optimizing design decisions, enhancing student model outcomes.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by
large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but
selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires
expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to
quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.
GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without
access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an
information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of
gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the
distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%
Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo
students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher
can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the
best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design
choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when
generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size
constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively
identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide
fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

TL;DR: This paper explores online learning with H\"older smooth functions and its implications for offline optimization, presenting universal and adaptive gradient-based methods that work across smooth and non-smooth regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how H\"older smoothness in online learning can bridge the gap between smooth and non-smooth optimization realms, and to develop universal methods adaptable across both.

Method: Designed gradient-variation online learning algorithms with adaptivity to H\"older smoothness and extended them to offline optimization using online-to-batch conversion and a detection-based guess-and-check procedure.

Result: Achieved adaptive regret guarantees in online settings and developed universal methods for stochastic and strongly convex offline optimization, offering smooth and non-smooth regime performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a unified framework for dealing with different smoothness regimes, presenting strong adaptivity and universality in both online and offline settings.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method integrating reinforcement learning and ensemble-based Bayesian filtering for learning surrogate state transition models from noisy observations without requiring true state trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of state estimation when the governing equations of dynamics are unknown and training data are noisy, making traditional supervised learning infeasible.

Method: A framework is proposed where the process of learning the surrogate model is treated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solved using reinforcement learning techniques. Offline learning enables the use of Bayesian filtering methods for state estimation during the online phase.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional scenarios, accommodating nonlinear and partially observed models.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning-based modeling offers a viable and effective alternative for state prediction in systems with unknown or noisy dynamics, improving estimation accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework for improving anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time series within Industrial IoT systems. This method combines quantum feature maps with federated learning, overcoming challenges of privacy, scalability, non-linearities, and imbalanced anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of Industrial IoT systems, there is a need for scalable and privacy-preserving anomaly detection methods that handle high-dimensional and multivariate time-series challenges, particularly under non-linear and imbalanced scenarios.

Method: The proposed FQKL framework uses quantum feature maps and federated aggregation. Quantum edge nodes compute local kernel statistics through parameterized quantum circuits and share compressed summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains models like federated quantum SVM.

Result: Experimental benchmarks on synthetic Industrial IoT scenarios show that FQKL improves generalization for complex temporal correlations, surpassing classical federated learning methods while significantly lowering communication overhead.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of quantum kernels combined with federated learning for efficient, robust, and scalable anomaly detection in next-gen IoT systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

*Fengjuan Wang,Zhiyi Su,Xingzhu Hu,Cheng Wang,Mou Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models is computationally expensive due to high demands on memory and processing. FP8-Flow-MoE introduces an optimized FP8-centric dataflow, reducing computational inefficiencies and enhancing throughput and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Mixture-of-Experts models are challenging to train due to high computing and memory demands, creating a strong need for efficient training methods.

Method: The paper proposes FP8-Flow-MoE, utilizing a quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow, scaling-aware transposes, and fused operators, minimizing quantize-dequantize operations and double quantization errors.

Result: Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model showcased 21% higher throughput and reduced memory usage by 16.5 GB per GPU, with stable convergence, compared to BF16 and naïve FP8 baselines.

Conclusion: FP8-Flow-MoE offers substantial computational efficiency improvements, making large-scale MoE model training feasible while retaining convergence stability.

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

### [206] [The Sequential Edge: Inverse-Entropy Voting Beats Parallel Self-Consistency at Matched Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02309)
*Aman Sharma,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether sequential scaling is more effective than parallel self-consistency for reasoning tasks in Language Models, finding sequential scaling to be superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to reassess test-time scaling strategies for reasoning tasks in language models to determine the optimal approach under equal token budget and compute constraints.

Method: Evaluation was conducted on five state-of-the-art open-source language models across three reasoning benchmarks, comparing parallel self-consistency to sequential scaling. They also proposed inverse-entropy weighted voting to enhance sequential scaling performance.

Result: Sequential scaling outperformed parallel self-consistency in 95.6% of test configurations, showing accuracy gains of up to 46.7%. Inverse-entropy weighted voting further improved results.

Conclusion: Sequential refinement should become the default approach for test-time scaling in language model reasoning, challenging the prevailing reliance on parallel self-consistency and prompting a reevaluation of inference-time optimization strategies.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

### [207] [Large-scale automatic carbon ion treatment planning for head and neck cancers via parallel multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02314)
*Jueye Zhang,Chao Yang,Youfang Lai,Kai-Wen Li,Wenting Yan,Yunzhou Xia,Haimei Zhang,Jingjing Zhou,Gen Yang,Chen Lin,Tian Li,Yibao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for optimizing head-and-neck cancer intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) plans, achieving superior organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing and clinically competitive plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HNC planning is challenging due to the proximity of critical organs-at-risk (OARs) to complex targets. Existing methods for IMCT are slow and require extensive manual tuning, leading to suboptimal plans.

Method: The authors propose a multi-agent RL framework using a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE) QMIX backbone with various enhancements, including historical DVH vectors as input, linear action-to-value transforms, and clinically informed piecewise rewards. A synchronous multi-process worker system interacts directly with a treatment planning system.

Result: The framework simultaneously optimized 45 treatment planning parameters in IMCT, producing plans comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score of 85.93% vs 85.02%), with significant improvement in OAR sparing for five organs.

Conclusion: The proposed MARL framework efficiently handles high-dimensional planning spaces in IMCT, achieving clinically competitive treatment plans with improved OAR sparing, thus addressing key challenges in HNC planning.

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

*Tianle Pu,Zijie Geng,Haoyang Liu,Shixuan Liu,Jie Wang,Li Zeng,Chao Chen,Changjun Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes RoME, a learning-based framework for domain-robust MILP optimization, significantly enhancing cross-domain and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based MILP solvers struggle with generalization across problem domains, limiting scalability and broad applicability.

Method: RoME uses a mixture-of-experts approach with dynamic routing via learned task embeddings and applies a two-level distributionally robust optimization: inter-domain and intra-domain.

Result: RoME achieves 67.7% performance improvement across five diverse domains and delivers measurable zero-shot gains on real-world MIPLIB instances.

Conclusion: Cross-domain training strengthens both generalization to new domains and performance within specific domains, showcasing RoME as a scalable and general-purpose MILP solver.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

*Fidan Karimova,Tong Chen,Yu Yang,Shazia Sadiq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HYSTL, a framework for predicting crimes in different cities using hypernetworks and a structured crime knowledge graph, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of predicting crimes effectively across cities with diverse data and varying crime types.

Method: The authors propose the HYSTL framework which uses a hypernetwork to dynamically generate prediction parameters based on crime types, utilizing a crime knowledge graph to bridge semantic gaps between different crimes.

Result: Experiments conducted on datasets from two cities with non-overlapping crime types show that HYSTL achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HYSTL proves to be a robust crime prediction framework that adapts to varying crime data from different cities using hypernetwork-based learning and crime type associations.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that
preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine
learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this
human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms
latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines
into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.

*Qingyun Sun,Jiayi Luo,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Hao Peng,Jianxin Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvoOOD, a framework to improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) in dynamic, non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle with generalization under inevitable distribution shifts in dynamic graphs, motivating the need for an approach that considers evolving environments for OOD generalization.

Method: EvoOOD uses an environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and predict the environment distribution. Additionally, it employs a mechanism for environment-aware invariant pattern recognition and performs causal interventions on nodes using sampled environment distributions.

Result: EvoOOD outperforms baseline methods on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets in scenarios involving distribution shifts.

Conclusion: EvoOOD is the first framework to explore and address dynamic graph OOD generalization from the perspective of environment evolution, demonstrating its effectiveness and innovation.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUMA-RAG addresses the challenges of maintaining freshness and cross-modal consistency in multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by introducing innovations like a multi-tier memory system, cross-modal alignment, and safe retrieval guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing RAG systems, particularly the challenges of maintaining fresh and efficient indices, as well as ensuring cross-modal consistency in multimodal streams.

Method: Introduced LUMA-RAG, a novel multimodal agent architecture with innovations including a dynamic multi-tier memory system, a streaming alignment bridge for cross-modal consistency, and stability-aware retrieval telemetry for safe retrieval guarantees.

Result: LUMA-RAG achieved robust multimodal retrieval performance, with Recall@10 reaching 0.94 for text-to-image, and stable audio-to-image Safe@1 at 1.0, showcasing its scalability and reliability in production systems.

Conclusion: LUMA-RAG provides an efficient and scalable framework for multimodal RAG, addressing both memory management and cross-modal semantic alignment challenges while delivering strong performance and stability in retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture for robust arrhythmia detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting heart arrhythmia early can prevent severe complications, but manual diagnosis is subjective and less efficient. Automated detection using deep learning provides better accuracy, consistency, and efficiency.

Method: The proposed method leverages CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM, incorporating H-Infinity filter-inspired parameters, to improve pattern recognition robustness and generalization in heart sound signal processing.

Result: The model was tested on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, achieving 99.42% accuracy and a 98.85% F1 score.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture proves superior and robust compared to existing benchmarks in arrhythmia detection, solving common challenges in biomedical datasets.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

TL;DR: The paper presents a decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown environments using Gaussian Processes, balancing exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with decentralized control in unknown spatial environments, necessitating scalable and autonomous solutions.

Method: Agents locally optimize their trajectories using a cost function inspired by GP-UCB, balancing locational cost and exploration. Updates are conducted using greedy selection of inducing points.

Result: Simulation results show the algorithm's effectiveness in exploring regions with high density and uncertainty in a decentralized manner.

Conclusion: The decentralized algorithm demonstrates scalable coverage control, relying on local communication and observations for effective exploration-exploitation trade-offs.

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

TL;DR: This paper formulates machine unlearning as a constrained optimization problem, proposes feasible updates for model parameters, and demonstrates its effectiveness in computer vision classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to unify and improve machine unlearning techniques by addressing constraints and preserving model utility.

Method: The authors introduce feasible updates based on masking and statistical guarantees to efficiently unlearn specific data without harming the model's performance.

Result: Experiments show the effectiveness of the approach with computer vision classifiers.

Conclusion: Feasible updates provide a promising way to improve unlearning techniques and can be integrated into existing methods.

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning advancements in medical imaging often lack statistical robustness; this paper incorporates underspecification as a factor when modeling false performance claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of false positive claims in performance improvements of machine learning methods in medical imaging.

Method: The paper extends an existing statistical framework by adding underspecification, quantifying variability caused by random initialization and training dynamics.

Result: Simulations show that even minor variability in training seeds significantly increases the evidence required to substantiate performance claims.

Conclusion: Training variance must be explicitly modeled to ensure reliable validation of medical imaging systems.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

*Xuan-Truong Quan,Xuan-Son Quan,Duc Do Minh,Vinh Nguyen Van*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), which constrains entity representations to a hypersphere to overcome limitations in current Euclidean-based models, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models like TransE operate in unbounded Euclidean spaces, but struggle with modeling complex relations and training inefficiencies. This paper aims to resolve these issues by employing geometric constraints.

Method: SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear Spherization Layer and interprets relations using a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. It embeds entities on a hypersphere, leveraging spherical geometry.

Result: Extensive experiments show SKGE consistently outperforms TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks (FB15k-237, CoDEx-M). Spherical geometry acts as a powerful regularizer and enables more robust representation learning.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that spherical geometric constraints enhance KGE performance significantly, advocating for geometric priors as essential in future KGE model design.

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a method that utilizes machine learning to accelerate classical PDE solvers by providing quality initial guesses, reducing computational time up to 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) are computationally intensive and hinder real-time, many-query, and design tasks. Traditional data-driven surrogates are fast but struggle with generalizability outside training data.

Method: NOWS integrates neural operators with traditional Krylov iterative solvers, such as conjugate gradient and GMRES, to produce high-quality initial guesses. It preserves existing numerical infrastructures, such as finite difference and finite element methods.

Result: NOWS achieves a reduction in computation time by up to 90%, improves iteration efficiency, and maintains the stability and convergence guarantees of classical solvers.

Conclusion: By merging the strengths of machine learning and traditional solvers, NOWS offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for accelerating high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate

*Rajan Das Gupta,Md Kishor Morol,Nafiz Fahad,Md Tanzib Hosain,Sumaya Binte Zilani Choya,Md Jakir Hossen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BRAINS, an AI-based system employing LLMs for early-stage Alzheimer's detection and monitoring using cognitive and neuroimaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing global burden of Alzheimer's demands early, accurate detection, particularly in regions with limited diagnostic resources.

Method: BRAINS incorporates a dual-module architecture: a Diagnostic Module leveraging fine-tuned LLMs on cognitive/neuroimaging data and a Case Retrieval Module for patient case encoding and comparison, merging them for inference.

Result: BRAINS effectively classifies disease severity, detects cognitive decline early, and performs well on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: BRAINS is a promising tool for scalable, explainable, and early detection of Alzheimer's, with potential for broader applications in neurodegeneration research.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework linking informativeness, geometric simplicity, and efficiency in representation learning through the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck (V-GIB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a connection between geometry, learning efficiency, and interpretability in machine learning representations.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework that combines mutual information and curvature regularization, utilizing the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck (V-GIB) with geometric proxies like Hutchinson trace and Jacobian norms.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the framework, demonstrating better generalization, stability, and interpretive efficiency under data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: V-GIB offers a principled approach to building geometrically-coherent and efficient representations, aligning with human-understandable structures.

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

### [221] [An End-to-End Learning Approach for Solving Capacitated Location-Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02525)
*Changhao Miao,Yuntian Zhang,Tongyu Wu,Fang Deng,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning approach called DRLHQ to solve capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) and open CLRPs (OCLRP), efficiently addressing location and routing decisions with superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLRPs combine location and routing decisions, making them complex and challenging due to intricate constraints and relationships. Despite progress in related areas, CLRPs require further exploration with advanced approaches like DRL.

Method: The paper proposes DRLHQ, an end-to-end learning approach based on the encoder-decoder framework, reformulating CLRPs as a Markov decision process and enhancing decision-making with a heterogeneous querying attention mechanism.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DRLHQ achieves higher solution quality and generalization performance compared to traditional and DRL-based methods for CLRP and OCLRP.

Conclusion: The novel DRLHQ framework effectively addresses the interdependencies in CLRPs and offers a generalizable and superior solution method compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

### [222] [Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531)
*Munib Mesinovic,Max Buhlan,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews causal graph neural networks for improving healthcare AI systems, addressing issues of distribution shift, discrimination, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI systems often fail due to reliance on statistical associations instead of causal mechanisms, leading to inadequate generalization, bias, and lack of clarity.

Method: The paper integrates causal inference principles with graph-based biomedical data representations to focus on invariant mechanisms rather than correlations, and outlines various methodologies and applications.

Result: Applications include improved clinical diagnostics, cancer subtyping, physiological monitoring, drug recommendations, and patient-specific causal digital twins for experimentation.

Conclusion: Despite promising advancements, challenges like computational requirements, validation complexities, and risks of 'causal-washing' remain, necessitating frameworks to ensure rigorous causal claims in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

*Hortence Nana,Andreas Athanasopoulos,Christos Dimitrakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores a many-to-one matching problem, such as college admissions, with colleges evaluating diverse student sets via non-linear utility functions. Stability is often unattainable, so the authors focus on fairness using Rawlsian concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical stable matchings cannot capture the non-linear diversity considerations for colleges and fail to exist in this broader setup. The paper aims to address this limitation and improve equity.

Method: The authors propose Rawlsian fairness-based solution concepts and develop deterministic and stochastic algorithms to maximize the minimum utility of the worst-off college.

Result: The algorithms enable iterative improvement for fairness outcomes when stability fails, providing a practical allocation method.

Conclusion: Rawlsian fairness-based methods are effective in addressing mismatched stability concerns, offering a promising alternative for fair many-to-one matching problems.

Abstract: We study a many-to-one matching problem, such as the college admission
problem, where each college can admit multiple students. Unlike classical
models, colleges evaluate sets of students through non-linear utility functions
that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical
stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

### [224] [Theoretical Guarantees for Causal Discovery on Large Random Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02536)
*Mathieu Chevalley,Arash Mehrjou,Patrick Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) under intervention settings in causal discovery, showing it reduces with increasing graph dimensionality and realistic graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in causal structure recovery where complex network topologies and high-dimensional data create issues for guaranteeing low false-negative rates during discovery.

Method: Analyzing theoretical bounds for FNR under single-variable random interventions with an ε-interventional faithfulness assumption across different graph topologies like Erdős–Rényi and Barabási–Albert graphs.

Result: The false-negative rate (FNR) concentrates around its mean in sparse networks, decreasing with dimensional growth and specific graph topologies like those with scale-free structures. Simulation results confirm this phenomenon.

Conclusion: High-dimensionality and realistic heterogeneous network structures significantly improve the reliability of causal edge orientation recovery, providing robust guarantees for causal discovery.

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

### [225] [Adaptive Neighborhood-Constrained Q Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02567)
*Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning (ANQ), a reinforcement learning algorithm that addresses extrapolation errors in offline RL by employing a novel neighborhood constraint approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline reinforcement learning faces challenges due to extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution actions. Existing constraints on action selection either suffer from over-conservativeness or difficulties in modeling behavior policies.

Method: The paper proposes a neighborhood constraint that restricts action selection to the union of neighborhoods around dataset actions, using adaptive radius based on data quality criteria. ANQ utilizes bilevel optimization for efficient Q-learning under these constraints.

Result: The ANQ algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on offline RL benchmarks and demonstrates robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited data.

Conclusion: The neighborhood constraint method addresses limitations of existing constraints, offering bounded extrapolation error, flexibility, and scalability in offline RL tasks, as validated by strong empirical results.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

*Lukas Fehring,Marcel Wever,Maximilian Spliethöver,Leona Hennig,Henning Wachsmuth,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a user-intervention method to steer Bayesian optimization (BO) in hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using expert knowledge during runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning experts find HPO, such as BO, less acceptable due to its black-box nature and limited user control, despite its proven efficacy.

Method: A generalized approach to BO (based on existing piBO) enabling runtime user input as informative priors, along with a misleading prior detection scheme to ensure robustness.

Result: The proposed method integrates multiple priors effectively, leveraging useful ones while rejecting or overcoming poor inputs, with performance comparable to traditional BO.

Conclusion: Interactive steering of BO via user inputs enhances its usability, reliability, and acceptance among experts, preserving the optimization process's integrity.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

### [227] [Directional-Clamp PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02577)
*Gilad Karpel,Ruida Zhou,Shoham Sabach,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Directional-Clamp PPO (DClamp-PPO), an improved reinforcement learning algorithm that builds on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by addressing the issue of importance ratios moving in the wrong direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has challenges with its importance ratios frequently moving in the wrong direction during optimization, which hinders performance.

Method: DClamp-PPO penalizes updates that cause importance ratios to move in the strict wrong direction through a tunable parameter and a steeper loss slope to enforce better behavior.

Result: DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO and its variants across various MuJoCo environments, as proven both theoretically and empirically.

Conclusion: Focusing on correcting wrong directional updates and keeping importance ratios closer to 1 improves the robustness and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

*Chitro Majumdar,Sergio Scandizzo,Ratanlal Mahanta,Avradip Mandal,Swarnendu Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omega^2 is a framework leveraging AI and machine learning to enhance reliability and clarity in corporate credit scoring, achieving high predictive performance on diverse financial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for an accurate and interpretable approach to corporate credit scoring, utilizing large language models combined with structured financial data.

Method: Omega^2 integrates advanced machine learning models (CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost) optimized via Bayesian search, implementing temporal validation on a multi-agency dataset containing financial indicators.

Result: Omega^2 achieved a high predictive accuracy with an average test AUC above 0.93 across different credit rating agencies and datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability and consistency.

Conclusion: This framework validates the use of language-based reasoning coupled with quantitative methods as a robust and transparent system for assessing corporate credit risk.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine
learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study
evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings
drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing
detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and
liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models
optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure
forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC
above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating
systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining
language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and
institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

*Mohammed Al-Jaff,Giovanni Luca Marchetti,Michael C Welle,Jens Lundell,Mats G. Gustafsson,Gustav Eje Henter,Hossein Azizpour,Danica Kragic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs) to improve generative models' stability, overcome adversarial objectives, and enhance data reconstruction and sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) suffer from issues such as mode collapse, mode dropping, and unstable training due to adversarial components in their objectives. This limits their ability to cover the data manifold completely. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The authors propose NAIGNs that use a loss function combining reconstruction and the non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE), moving away from adversarial training.

Result: NAIGNs demonstrate improved capabilities in restoring corrupted data and generating new samples close to the data distribution. Additionally, they implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold and act as energy-based models.

Conclusion: Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks overcome the limitations of IGNs, offering a more stable and effective approach to generative modeling without adversarial training methods.

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

*David Kattermann,Lothar Sebastian Krapp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies computable PAC (CPAC) learning and its relationship with recursively enumerable representable (RER) classes. It explores effective VC-dimensions and establishes key characterizations and guarantees for CPAC learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how computability constraints affect PAC learnability and explore the role of RER classes in characterizing CPAC learning.

Method: The authors analyze the connections between CPAC learning, effective VC-dimension, and RER classes using theoretical frameworks and examples.

Result: The study shows that effective VC-dimensions for RER classes can exceed the traditional VC-dimensions, provides characterizations of CPAC learnability through RER containment, and guarantees agnostic learnability for RER classes under nonuniform CPAC learning.

Conclusion: The results deepen the understanding of CPAC learning, defining relationships between learning frameworks, effective dimensions, and RER classes, thereby extending the theory of algorithmic learning.

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

*Tiziano Balaconi,Aldo Glielmo,Marco Taboga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GasRL is a simulator combining natural gas market modeling with deep reinforcement learning for stockpile management analysis, using Soft Actor Critic for optimal policies evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and optimize gas storage management's impact on market pricing and supply-demand dynamics, while providing insights into EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds.

Method: A simulator called GasRL couples natural gas market representation with reinforcement learning-trained storage operator policies, particularly using the SAC algorithm.

Result: The model achieves profitability, robust market clearing, and price stabilization, with SAC-induced equilibrium dynamics matching real-world price volatility and seasonality.

Conclusion: GasRL effectively evaluates storage policies, demonstrating that EU-mandated thresholds enhance market resilience during supply shocks.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Apriel-H1, hybrid models mixing transformer attention and State Space Models (SSMs) to enhance reasoning efficiency with dramatically improved inference throughput and minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of transformers during inference due to quadratic scaling and memory constraints, which hinder long-context reasoning, high-throughput processing, and efficient deployment.

Method: The authors develop Apriel-H1 models by gradually replacing transformer attention layers with linear Mamba state-space mixers through distillation from a pretrained 15B reasoning transformer and optimizing variants with different SSM-to-MHA configurations.

Result: Post-distillation models with varying SSM layers achieve over 2x inference throughput improvement with minimal reasoning quality compromise, especially in a production-ready environment.

Conclusion: Hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures present a viable path for efficient reasoning without significantly sacrificing performance, offering scalable solutions for high-throughput applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities
through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,
transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention
module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which
severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is
critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under
high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.
  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with
linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent
computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we
introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer
attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.
These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained
reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing
less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.
  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with
different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as
more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant
of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,
achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the
production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning
performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can
deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent
without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.

Motivation: To address the challenges of robust federated learning against Byzantine adversaries while improving communication efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes a new algorithm, Byzantineresilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL), combining Nesterov's momentum and Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules.

Result: The proposed method achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and stronger resilience against different Byzantine attack strategies, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: Byrd-NAFL improves federated learning by enhancing robustness and communication efficiency in adversarial settings, supported by theoretical and experimental findings.

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

*Cooper Simpson,Stephen Becker,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel in situ neural training protocol utilizing memory buffers and sketched data samples to prevent catastrophic forgetting in implicit neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in catastrophic forgetting and to achieve high compression rates while maintaining strong reconstruction performance in in situ neural training.

Method: The approach uses limited memory buffers containing full and sketched data samples, with sketching employed as a regularizer informed by a Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem result.

Result: The proposed method achieves strong reconstruction performance on complex 2D and 3D simulation data, unstructured grids, and non-Cartesian geometries with high compression rates.

Conclusion: Sketching integrates effectively in the in situ scheme, allowing it to achieve performance comparable to the offline method, showcasing its potential for continual learning and neural compression.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

*Giacomo Camposampiero,Pietro Barbiero,Michael Hersche,Roger Wattenhofer,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses compositional generalization in machine learning by introducing a scalable evaluation framework, benchmarking supervised vision models, and proposing a new model class with enhanced performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, requiring models to understand unknown combinations of known concepts. Current evaluation protocols and benchmarks have limitations in rigor and scalability, presenting obstacles for effective assessment and progress.

Method: The paper introduces a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends previous methods with reduced computational requirements. It conducts extensive studies on supervised vision backbones (training over 5000 models) and proposes 'Attribute Invariant Networks', a new model class optimized for compositional generalization.

Result: Tests demonstrate a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization with Attribute Invariant Networks, achieving a 23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines and reducing parameter overhead from 600% to 16%.

Conclusion: The study enhances the compositional generalization landscape with scalable evaluation protocols, rigorous benchmarks, and more efficient models, indicating significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

*Georgios Tzannetos,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a curriculum learning strategy that incrementally tightens constraints to train agents for deployment under complex trajectory constraints, validated across RL and LLM agents with improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is the challenge of training agents to operate under stringent deployment constraints, such as resource limitations or safety requirements, which add complexity to tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a curriculum learning strategy inspired by self-paced learning techniques, where agents are trained on simplified constraint environments initially, and constraints are gradually tightened to match deployment requirements.

Result: The proposed method is shown, via theoretical analysis and empirical validation, to accelerate training for RL agents and demonstrate effectiveness across diverse settings, including LLM applications. It also enables output compression and faster inference for LLMs.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning is an effective strategy for enabling agents to adapt efficiently to complex constraints during deployment, with benefits in training speed and resource usage.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

### [237] [Does Interpretability of Knowledge Tracing Models Support Teacher Decision Making?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02718)
*Adia Khalid,Alina Deriyeva,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of interpretable knowledge tracing (KT) models on teaching decisions, showing mixed results regarding the benefits of their interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether interpretable KT models aid human teachers in making effective teaching decisions.

Method: The authors conducted a simulation study comparing task mastery using interpretable versus non-interpretable KT models, followed by a user study with 12 human teachers evaluating usability and trust of KT models.

Result: Simulation results indicate faster mastery with interpretable KT models. However, teachers in the user study rated interpretability positively but did not show significant differences in task efficiency.

Conclusion: Interpretable KT models may improve usability and trust but do not necessarily streamline teaching decisions. Further research is needed to understand how teachers utilize these models in practice.

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

*Ilies Chibane,Thomas George,Pierre Nodet,Vincent Lemaire*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses mislabeled data in machine learning by exploring calibration techniques to enhance mislabeled data detection, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mislabeled data harms machine learning performance, so reliable detection and correction are crucial for effective systems.

Method: This approach trains a base machine learning model, applies calibration techniques, and evaluates its robustness in detecting mislabeled data.

Result: Calibrated models show significant improvements in detecting mislabeled instances compared to uncalibrated counterparts.

Conclusion: Calibration enhances mislabeled data detection accuracy and robustness, offering practical benefits for industrial applications.

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

### [239] [From Solo to Symphony: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Collaboration with Single-Agent Demos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02762)
*Xun Wang,Zhuoran Li,Yanshan Lin,Hai Zhong,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), which utilizes solo experiences to improve multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) efficiency and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents from scratch in MARL is highly inefficient and relies on costly multi-agent data, while solo experiences are more accessible and underutilized.

Method: The proposed SoCo framework first pretrains a shared solo policy using solo demonstrations, then integrates it into cooperative learning through a policy fusion mechanism using a gating selector and action editor.

Result: Experimental results show that SoCo boosts both training efficiency and performance for various cooperative tasks compared to standard MARL approaches.

Conclusion: Solo demonstrations are a scalable and effective addition to multi-agent data, enabling more practical and efficient cooperative learning in MARL.

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

### [240] [VecComp: Vector Computing via MIMO Digital Over-the-Air Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02765)
*Saeed Razavikia,José Mairton Barros Da Silva Junior,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VecComp extends ChannelComp to support vector function computation using multiple-antenna technology. It enhances computational efficiency and robustness under fading channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ChannelComp framework is limited to scalar function computation and is susceptible to channel fading, necessitating the need for supporting vector computations while addressing channel impairments.

Method: The study proposes VecComp, which combines ChannelComp with multiple-antenna technology to allow scalable and efficient computation for vector functions, resilient to fading channels.

Result: VecComp improves vector function computation under fading channels and demonstrates effectiveness in numerical experiments with reduced mean squared error.

Conclusion: VecComp broadens the capabilities of over-the-air computation to support vector-based tasks while ensuring robustness and scalability, making it ideal for high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents STAR-VAE, a scalable latent-variable framework for molecular generation, using Transformer-based architecture and SELFIES encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vast chemical space of drug-like molecules and develop an efficient generative model with broad chemical distribution capabilities, conditional generation, and fast molecular generation.

Method: Introduces STAR-VAE with a Transformer encoder, autoregressive Transformer decoder, and latent-variable formulation using SELFIES for syntactic validity. Enables property-guided generation and efficient finetuning with LoRA.

Result: STAR-VAE achieves strong performance on GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks for molecular generation and demonstrates semantically structured latent representations. It improves conditional model output on Tartarus benchmarks for docking scores.

Conclusion: The study showcases the effectiveness of a modernized, scalable VAE framework, highlighting its competitive advantages in molecular generation through principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

### [242] [Adam Reduces a Unique Form of Sharpness: Theoretical Insights Near the Minimizer Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02773)
*Xinghan Li,Haodong Wen,Kaifeng Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper finds that Adam optimizer minimizes a unique sharpness measure created by its adaptive updates, resulting in solutions that differ from SGD, specifically in certain settings like sparse linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how solutions found by the Adam optimizer differ from those found by SGD and assess its behavior in reducing sharpness for better generalization and optimization.

Method: The authors use mathematical and continuous-time approximation methods through stochastic differential equations to rigorously analyze Adam's behavior in comparison to SGD in specific optimization contexts.

Result: The analysis shows that Adam implicitly minimizes a sharpness measure, enabling better sparsity and generalization in cases like sparse linear regression, compared to SGD.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into Adam and other adaptive gradient methods, explaining their impact on reducing sharpness and delivering a unified perspective that could drive future optimizer designs.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

### [243] [Enhancing Federated Learning Privacy with QUBO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02785)
*Andras Ferenczi,Sutapa Samanta,Dagen Wang,Todd Hodges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy risks in federated learning by reducing client exposure using a quantum-inspired optimization method, yielding significant privacy improvements while maintaining or enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate privacy risks in federated learning, where cumulative exposure increases threat levels, such as membership inference attacks, property inference attacks, and model inversion attacks.

Method: The authors employ a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) to select only the most relevant client updates for training rounds, addressing information leakage and adversary threats.

Result: Experiments demonstrated 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction on the MNIST dataset, with accurate results maintained. Similarly, tests on the CINIC-10 dataset showed 82% per-round and 33% cumulative privacy improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances privacy in federated learning by minimizing client exposure while maintaining or exceeding model accuracy, proving its scalability and efficiency through experiments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

*Nicolas Riccieri Gardin Assumpcao,Leandro Villas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces FPP, a method to ensure privacy and protect federated learning from attacks, using assessments and reputation-based mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable secure federated learning, protecting training outcomes while preserving data privacy.

Method: FPP evaluates training rounds via assessments, supports recovery post-attack, and uses a reputation system to limit attacker participation.

Result: Experiments show FPP rapidly converges and is resilient to model poisoning attacks, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: FPP is effective in ensuring both security and privacy in federated learning, even under malicious attacks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabTune is a unified library to standardize workflows for tabular foundation models, offering consistent access to several models and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a standardized approach to adopt tabular foundation models has arisen due to heterogeneous preprocessing, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning, and lack of deployment-focused evaluations like calibration and fairness.

Method: TabTune provides a single interface for model-aware preprocessing, supports various fine-tuning approaches including zero-shot inference and parameter-efficient methods, and integrates evaluation for performance, fairness, and calibration.

Result: TabTune standardizes workflows of tabular foundation models, supports seven state-of-the-art models, and ensures consistent benchmarking and reproducibility.

Conclusion: The introduction of TabTune simplifies the application of tabular foundation models by providing a centralized and reproducible framework for their evaluation and implementation.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data
learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains.
However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing
pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the
absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as
calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a
single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art
models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and

TL;DR: The paper discusses using machine learning for predicting game outcomes in MLB, explores the relationship between predicted win probabilities and score differential, and evaluates its application in run-line betting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive accuracy in MLB game outcomes and evaluate the usage of machine learning in decision-making for betting strategies.

Method: Various machine learning models were trained on a shared dataset to predict win probabilities, analyze their correlation with score strength, and assess their performance in betting scenarios.

Result: The models exhibited a connection between win probabilities and score differential, and effective betting strategies resulted in positive returns. Naïve approaches led to losses.

Conclusion: Machine learning can predict MLB outcomes and guide successful betting strategies when used appropriately, but careless application can lead to losses.

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

*Hakob Tamazyan,Ani Vanyan,Alvard Barseghyan,Anna Khosrovyan,Evan Shelhamer,Hrant Khachatrian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoCrossBench, a benchmark to evaluate the generalization capabilities of remote sensing models for new satellites. It highlights challenges in performance drops with no band overlap and the addition of extra bands, and proposes ChiViT, a self-supervised model improving cross-satellite results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing diversity of satellites and labeled data dependency on older satellite types necessitate developing models that generalize well to new satellite data without costly retraining.

Method: The authors created GeoCrossBench to test model adaptability across scenarios (in-distribution, no band overlap, additional bands). They also proposed ChiViT, a self-supervised ChannelViT extension, enhancing cross-satellite performance.

Result: ChiViT outperforms other models like DINOv3 in scenarios with no band overlap but exhibits performance drops in cases involving new bands. Fine-tuning models on oracle labels yields consistent results, emphasizing a need for improving models.

Conclusion: Current foundation models fail to achieve optimal cross-satellite generalization. Expanded benchmarks like GeoCrossBench and models like ChiViT highlight gaps, motivating development for better generalization in satellite data modeling.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAPIN, a biologically inspired model that learns by minimizing local prediction errors and adapts its structure while solving tasks like CartPole with robust performance and a stable policy after locking parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional neural networks rely on global backpropagation, which is biologically implausible. This paper aims to create a model inspired by active inference and morphological plasticity.

Method: The SAPIN model uses local prediction-error minimization and two learning mechanisms: synaptic plasticity via Hebbian-like rules and structural plasticity where cells reposition on a 2D grid.

Result: SAPIN successfully solved the CartPole task with robust performance, discovering a stable balancing policy. Post-locking parameters resulted in an 82% average success rate over repeated trials.

Conclusion: SAPIN showcases that biologically motivated principles can drive computation and learning while maintaining stability. Locking learned parameters ensures high performance in continual learning.

Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible
learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the
Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel
computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the
morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates
on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local
prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning
mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the
temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned
expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically
migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This
dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information
(synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources
(network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole
reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture
can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The
network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis
was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while
continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after
achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes
post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks
maintained an average 82% success rate.

### [249] [Evolutionary Algorithm for Chance Constrained Quadratic Multiple Knapsack Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02500)
*Kokila Kasuni Perera,Aneta Neumann*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the stochastic variant of the Quadratic Multiple Knapsack Problem (QMKP) with chance constraints, proposing a hybrid algorithm combining evolutionary algorithms (EA) with multi-factorial optimisation (MFO) for effective resource allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of optimising resource allocation in scenarios with randomised profits and multiple constraints, a representation of complex real-world problems.

Method: A hybrid approach combining evolutionary algorithms (EAs) with a local optimisation strategy based on multi-factorial optimisation (MFO) was proposed. The methodology involved global search with EA and local refinement using MFO-inspired optimisation tailored for each knapsack.

Result: Experimental results revealed the hybrid approach, particularly when integrating MFO, performs well under tight chance and capacity constraints, improving optimisation outcomes compared to standalone EAs.

Conclusion: The hybrid EA-MFO strategy demonstrates strong performance for stochastic QMKP, extending the applicability of resource allocation solutions to complex stochastic environments.

Abstract: Quadratic multiple knapsack problem (QMKP) is a combinatorial optimisation
problem characterised by multiple weight capacity constraints and a profit
function that combines linear and quadratic profits. We study a stochastic
variant of this problem where profits are considered as random variables. This
problem reflects complex resource allocation problems in real-world scenarios
where randomness is inherent. We model this problem using chance constraints to
capture the stochastic profits. We propose a hybrid approach for this problem,
which combines an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with a local optimisation
strategy inspired by multi-factorial optimisation (MFO). EAs are used for
global search due to their effectiveness in handling large, complex solution
spaces. In the hybrid approach, EA periodically passes interim solutions to the
local optimiser for refinement. The local optimiser applies MFO principles,
which are typically used in multi-tasking problems. The local optimiser models
the local problem as a multi-tasking problem by constructing disjoint search
spaces for each knapsack based on an input solution. For each item, its
assignment across all knapsacks is considered to determine the preferred
knapsack. Items are then divided into disjoint groups corresponding to each
knapsack, allowing each knapsack to be treated as a separate optimisation task.
This structure enables effective application of MFO-based local refinements. We
consider two EAs for the problem, (1+1) EA and ($\mu+\lambda$) EA. We conduct
experiments to explore the effectiveness of these EAs on their own and also
with the proposed local optimiser. Experimental results suggest that hybrid
approaches, particularly those incorporating MFO, perform well on instances
where chance constraints and capacity constraints are tight.

### [250] [Oriented Metrics for Bottom-Up Enumerative Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02491)
*Roland Meyer,Jakob Tepe*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces oriented metrics for string and bitvector domains to reduce the search space in syntax-guided synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing the massive search space in syntax-guided synthesis by leveraging structured metrics aligned with operations' asymmetry.

Method: Developing oriented metrics for string and bitvector domains and introducing four techniques (search-space ball pruning, equivalence-based factorization, metric abstraction-refinement, improved enumeration ordering) to optimize synthesis algorithms.

Result: The techniques were implemented into a new generic solver that, in experimental tests, outperformed state-of-the-art by over an order of magnitude in performance.

Conclusion: Oriented metrics and their related techniques significantly enhance the efficiency of syntax-guided synthesis by making search spaces more structured and manageable.

Abstract: In syntax-guided synthesis, one of the challenges is to reduce the enormous
size of the search space. We observe that most search spaces are not just flat
sets of programs, but can be endowed with a structure that we call an oriented
metric. Oriented metrics measure the distance between programs, like ordinary
metrics do, but are designed for settings in which operations have an
orientation. Our focus is on the string and the bitvector domains, where
operations like concatenation and bitwise conjunction transform an input into
an output in a way that is not symmetric. We develop several new oriented
metrics for these domains. Oriented metrics are designed for search space
reduction, and we present four techniques: (i) pruning the search space to a
ball around the ground truth, (ii) factorizing the search space by an
equivalence that is induced by the oriented metric, (iii) abstracting the
oriented metric (and hence the equivalence) and refining it, and (iv) improving
the enumeration order by learning from abstract information. We acknowledge
that these techniques are inspired by developments in the literature. By
understanding their roots in oriented metrics, we can substantially increase
their applicability and efficiency. We have integrated these techniques into a
new synthesis algorithm and implemented the algorithm in a new solver. Notably,
our solver is generic in the oriented metric over which it computes. We
conducted experiments in the string and the bitvector domains, and consistently
improve the performance over the state-of-the-art by more than an order of
magnitude.

*Sangyun Park,Jin Kim,Yuchen Cui,Matthew S. Brown*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRACE, a new methodology integrating textual reasoning to improve visual-language models (VLMs) for robotic manipulation tasks, showing improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome VLMs' challenge in translating abstract instructions into precise spatial actions needed for robotic manipulation, which current methods fail to achieve efficiently.

Method: The method involves creating TRACE, combining textual Chain of Reasoning (CoR) and generating a dataset with explicit textual rationales, then fine-tuning the VLMs on this dataset.

Result: The TRACE-tuned model achieved state-of-the-art performance with 48.1% accuracy on the Where2Place (W2P) benchmark, a 9.6% improvement, and 55.0% on a more challenging W2P(h) subset.

Conclusion: Training VLMs with a textual CoR significantly enhances their precision, reliability, and interpretability for robotic control, with reasoning data playing a critical role in performance improvement.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to translate high-level instructions
into the precise spatial affordances required for robotic manipulation. While
visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally
intensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance
Coordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of
Reasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology
to create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous
pipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By
fine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial
reasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model
achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary
Where2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more
challenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that
performance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming
the CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps
reveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically
across reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a
textual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision,
reliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control. Our dataset and
code are available at https://github.com/jink-ucla/TRACE

### [252] [Stein-based Optimization of Sampling Distributions in Model Predictive Path Integral Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02015)
*Jace Aldrich,Odest Chadwicke Jenkins*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called SOPPI that optimizes Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control using Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), improving trajectory sampling and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control relies on random sampling which can sometimes lead to suboptimal results due to inadequate representation of trajectory spaces. This paper aims to optimize sample generation for MPPI to achieve better control outcomes.

Method: The authors combined MPPI control with Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) updates during runtime. This technique adjusts noise distributions dynamically to improve trajectory representation without significant computational overhead.

Result: The proposed method, SOPPI, exhibited enhanced performance over conventional MPPI in various systems like Cart-Pole and bipedal walking tasks. It also showed improved feasibility at lower particle counts.

Conclusion: SOPPI optimizes trajectory sampling for MPPI using SVGD, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency in improving control outcomes, with applicability to complex, high-degree-of-freedom systems and differentiable simulators.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
control that optimizes sample generation towards an optimal trajectory through
Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD). MPPI is traditionally reliant on
randomly sampled trajectories, often by a Gaussian distribution. The result can
lead to sample deprivation, under-representing the space of possible
trajectories, and yield suboptimal results. Through introducing SVGD updates in
between MPPI environment steps, we present Stein-Optimized Path-Integral
Inference (SOPPI), an MPPI/SVGD algorithm that can dynamically update noise
distributions at runtime to shape a more optimal representation without an
excessive increase in computational requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our method systems ranging from a Cart-Pole to a two-dimensional bipedal
walking task, indicating improved performance above standard MPPI across a
range of hyper-parameters and demonstrate feasibility at lower particle counts.
We discuss the applicability of this MPPI/SVGD method to higher
degree-of-freedom systems, as well as its potential to new developments in
state-of-the-art differentiable simulators.

Method: The method involves utilizing GPU and CPU optimizations, including GPU offloading for map point triangulation, fusion tasks, GPU-accelerated local bundle adjustment, and CPU-accelerated redundant keyframe culling.

Result: The results show that TurboMap achieves an average speedup of 1.3x on the EuRoC dataset and 1.6x on the TUM-VI dataset, while maintaining accuracy, across desktop and embedded platforms.

Conclusion: TurboMap effectively enhances the local mapping module of visual SLAM systems, demonstrating improved speed without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents TurboMap, a GPU-accelerated and CPU-optimized local
mapping module for visual SLAM systems. We identify key performance bottlenecks
in the local mapping process for visual SLAM and address them through targeted
GPU and CPU optimizations. Specifically, we offload map point triangulation and
fusion to the GPU, accelerate redundant keyframe culling on the CPU, and
integrate a GPU-accelerated solver to speed up local bundle adjustment. Our
implementation is built on top of ORB-SLAM3 and leverages CUDA for GPU
programming. The experimental results show that TurboMap achieves an average
speedup of 1.3x in the EuRoC dataset and 1.6x in the TUM-VI dataset in the
local mapping module, on both desktop and embedded platforms, while maintaining
the accuracy of the original system.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TACO, a framework for optimizing quadrotor controller parameters in real-time and improving trajectory feasibility, outperforming traditional tuning methods and enabling fast real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fixed, manually tuned controller parameters for quadrotor trajectory tracking that reduce task-specific performance.

Method: TACO adapts controller parameters based on predictive modeling, lightweight optimization, and large-scale simulation for diverse trajectory training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate TACO's superior performance in trajectory tracking and speed over conventional tuning methods, enabling real-time deployment and trajectory adaptation for reduced tracking errors.

Conclusion: TACO enables improved quadrotor trajectory tracking through adaptive control and optimized trajectories, outperforming static parameter tuning and supporting real-world implementations.

Abstract: Controller performance in quadrotor trajectory tracking depends heavily on
parameter tuning, yet standard approaches often rely on fixed, manually tuned
parameters that sacrifice task-specific performance. We present
Trajectory-Aware Controller Optimization (TACO), a framework that adapts
controller parameters online based on the upcoming reference trajectory and
current quadrotor state. TACO employs a learned predictive model and a
lightweight optimization scheme to optimize controller gains in real time with
respect to a broad class of trajectories, and can also be used to adapt
trajectories to improve dynamic feasibility while respecting smoothness
constraints. To enable large-scale training, we also introduce a parallelized
quadrotor simulator supporting fast data collection on diverse trajectories.
Experiments on a variety of trajectory types show that TACO outperforms
conventional, static parameter tuning while operating orders of magnitude
faster than black-box optimization baselines, enabling practical real-time
deployment on a physical quadrotor. Furthermore, we show that adapting
trajectories using TACO significantly reduces the tracking error obtained by
the quadrotor.

*Peng-Fei Zhang,Ying Cheng,Xiaofan Sun,Shijie Wang,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper surveys the role of world models in robotics focusing on manipulation tasks, analyzing their core capabilities like perception, prediction, and control while proposing future development directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents require understanding of environmental dynamics for advanced tasks, necessitating robust internal representations or world models.

Method: Using robotic manipulation as the basis, the paper reviews methods that exhibit world model capabilities such as prediction and reasoning without strictly enforcing a predefined definition.

Result: It identifies key challenges and solutions, clarifies essential components and capabilities of world models, and analyzes their practical roles in robotics.

Conclusion: The analysis provides insights and outlines a roadmap to design generalizable and efficient world models for robotics.

Abstract: Autonomous agents are increasingly expected to operate in complex, dynamic,
and uncertain environments, performing tasks such as manipulation, navigation,
and decision-making. Achieving these capabilities requires agents to understand
the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the world, moving beyond purely
reactive control or simple replication of observed states. This motivates the
development of world models as internal representations that encode
environmental states, capture dynamics, and enable prediction, planning, and
reasoning. Despite growing interest, the definition, scope, architectures, and
essential capabilities of world models remain ambiguous. In this survey, rather
than directly imposing a fixed definition and limiting our scope to methods
explicitly labeled as world models, we examine approaches that exhibit the core
capabilities of world models through a review of methods in robotic
manipulation. We analyze their roles across perception, prediction, and
control, identify key challenges and solutions, and distill the core
components, capabilities, and functions that a real world model should possess.
Building on this analysis, we aim to outline a roadmap for developing
generalizable and practical world models for robotics.

*Tyler M. Paine,Anastasia Bizyaeva,Michael R. Benjamin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a layered model for multi-robot systems applicable for marine environments, combining collective decision-making via census and individual optimization via interval programming, experimentally validating its effectiveness in multiple scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in improving collaborative multi-robot systems to enhance efficiency and robustness, particularly for marine environments, where both group and individual robot behaviors must be optimized.

Method: The method introduces a layered model: census (weighted neighbor input for collective decisions) and interval programming (multi-objective individual optimization). A nonlinear opinion dynamics model and gradient descent algorithm contribute to subgroup allocation optimization.

Result: The proposed model successfully facilitates collaborative behaviors and individual decision-making in real-world scenarios, validated through experiments such as adaptive sampling and capture the flag among robot fleets.

Conclusion: The model provides a foundation for combining collective autonomy and individual optimization, enabling novel behaviors and effective collaboration in multi-robot systems.

Abstract: Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete
missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are
particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue
is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the
full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of
multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This
paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the
principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for
collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior
optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component
is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective
behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model
can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization
and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors
that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new
method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where
robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost
functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states
from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group
can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the
total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in
three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface
vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario,
and a competitive game of capture the flag.

Motivation: The challenge of enabling physical object creation from text prompts, especially for multi-component objects, motivates this work.

Method: The pipeline combines 3D generative AI and VLMs for reasoning about geometry and functionality. It decomposes AI-generated meshes into 3D models using predefined structural and panel components.

Result: Evaluation shows users preferred VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, outperforming rule-based methods (59.4%) and random assignment (2.5%).

Conclusion: The system enhances human control and agency in the creation of physical objects with generative AI and robotics by allowing users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback.

Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects
from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple
component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with
vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component
objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot,
multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose
AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural
and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which
mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based
on object functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users
preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4%
for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users
to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling
greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI
and robotics.

Motivation: To improve surgical precision, surgeon comfort, and efficiency in minimally invasive surgery through robotic assistance.

Method: Developed a 7-DOF robotic arm incorporating kinematic optimizations like a remote center of motion (RCM) and ergonomic enhancements. Conducted simulated surgical tasks to evaluate performance against conventional laparoscopy.

Result: The robot achieved over 50% improvement in targeting accuracy, shorter task completion times, and reduced muscle strain and discomfort compared to manual methods.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of kinematic and ergonomic designs in surgical robotics, providing insights for next-generation systems to improve both surgical outcomes and ergonomics.

Abstract: Robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery can greatly enhance surgical
precision and reduce surgeon fatigue. This paper presents a focused
investigation on the kinematic and ergonomic design principles for a
laparoscopic surgical robotic arm aimed at high-precision tasks. We propose a
7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm system that incorporates a remote
center of motion (RCM) at the instrument insertion point and ergonomic
considerations to improve surgeon interaction. The design is implemented on a
general-purpose robotic platform, and a series of simulated surgical tasks were
performed to evaluate targeting accuracy, task efficiency, and surgeon comfort
compared to conventional manual laparoscopy. Experimental results demonstrate
that the optimized robotic design achieves significantly improved targeting
accuracy (error reduced by over 50%) and shorter task completion times, while
substantially lowering operator muscle strain and discomfort. These findings
validate the importance of kinematic optimization (such as added articulations
and tremor filtering) and human-centered ergonomic design in enhancing the
performance of robot-assisted surgery. The insights from this work can guide
the development of next-generation surgical robots that improve surgical
outcomes and ergonomics for the operating team.

*Linxin Hou,Qirui Wu,Zhihang Qin,Neil Banerjee,Yongxin Guo,Cecilia Laschi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper compares centralized and distributed MARL architectures for controlling a soft robotic arm modeled as a Cosserat rod in simulation, demonstrating trade-offs in success rate, resilience, and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore and quantify the performance differences between centralized and distributed reinforcement learning architectures in controlling soft robotic systems, particularly focusing on scenarios like disturbance recovery and actuator failure.

Method: Using PyElastica and OpenAI Gym, the researchers trained both centralized PPO and distributed MAPPO policies under identical conditions while systematically varying the number of controlled sections ($n$) to evaluate the arm's performance across different scenarios.

Result: The paper found centralized policies outperform distributed ones in very simple systems ($n <= 2$). For larger systems ($4 < n <= 12$), distributed policies exhibited better sample efficiency, success rate, and robustness but required longer training times.

Conclusion: The findings highlight trade-offs between centralized and distributed policies, offering insights for the design and implementation of MARL for soft robotic control, particularly balancing between time efficiency and robustness in sim-to-real applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and
distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for
controlling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using
PyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy
Optimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical
budgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled
sections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of
the arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,
recovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.
Quantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean
final distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that
there are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of
controlled sections $n\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\le2$, the
centralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<
n\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these
systems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and
robustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the
same sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time
efficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of
samples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and
distributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic
systems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer
in soft rod-like manipulators.

### [260] [LACY: A Vision-Language Model-based Language-Action Cycle for Self-Improving Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02239)
*Youngjin Hong,Houjian Yu,Mingen Li,Changhyun Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a model that maps between language and actions bidirectionally, enhancing robotic manipulation performance and language grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current robotic manipulation models that map language to actions (L2A) but lack deeper contextual understanding and bidirectionality, which inhibits generalization and explanation capabilities.

Method: LACY is a vision-language model trained on three tasks: mapping language to actions (L2A), mapping actions to language (A2L), and verifying language descriptions' semantic consistency (L2C). It employs a self-improving cycle to autonomously generate and filter training data using active augmentation on low-confidence cases.

Result: LACY improves robotic manipulation task success rates by 56.46% on average in simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating robust language-action grounding.

Conclusion: The bidirectional learning framework of LACY enhances language-action interaction and self-supervised learning, paving the way for more contextual and generalizable robotic manipulation systems.

Abstract: Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies
on large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,
this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper
contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their
behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to
language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent
capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal
representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We
introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such
bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly
trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from
language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying
semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a
self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data
through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby
improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on
pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY
improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust
language-action grounding for robotic manipulation. Project page:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Suckers are improved for robotic applications by integrating high-fidelity tactile sensing using a camera-based design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of perceptual and tactile capabilities in existing robotic suckers for complex tasks.

Method: Develop SuckTac, a camera-embedded sucker with optimized design using multi-material casting and mechanical refinements.

Result: SuckTac enables fine-grain surface perception and demonstrates superior robotic manipulation performance in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed sucker design enhances perception, robustness, and adaptability, showcasing potential in diverse real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Suckers are significant for robots in picking, transferring, manipulation and
locomotion on diverse surfaces. However, most of the existing suckers lack
high-fidelity perceptual and tactile sensing, which impedes them from resolving
the fine-grained geometric features and interaction status of the target
surface. This limits their robust performance with irregular objects and in
complex, unstructured environments. Inspired by the adaptive structure and
high-performance sensory capabilities of cephalopod suckers, in this paper, we
propose a novel, intelligent sucker, named SuckTac, that integrates a
camera-based tactile sensor directly within its optimized structure to provide
high-density perception and robust suction. Specifically, through joint
structure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated
casting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker,
which enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface
shape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability,
the sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile,
adding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure. Extensive
experiments, including challenging tasks such as robotic cloth manipulation and
soft mobile robot inspection, demonstrate the superior performance and broad
applicability of the proposed system.

### [263] [Whole-body motion planning and safety-critical control for aerial manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02342)
*Lin Yang,Jinwoo Lee,Domenico Campolo,H. Jin Kim,Jeonghyun Byun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to aerial manipulation, leveraging superquadrics for accurate collision avoidance and combining it with safety-critical control to outperform existing methods in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of planning safe and dynamically feasible trajectories for aerial manipulators in complex environments, overcoming limitations of traditional geometric abstractions.

Method: The approach involves using superquadrics for modeling the vehicle and obstacles, a maximum-clearance planner combining Voronoi diagrams with an equilibrium-manifold formulation, and a safety-critical controller using high-order control barrier functions.

Result: The proposed framework produces faster, safer, and smoother trajectories in simulations, surpasses ellipsoid-based performance benchmarks in geometric accuracy, and demonstrates robust real-world performance on a physical aerial-manipulation platform.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates advanced geometric modeling and control strategies, delivering enhanced performance and demonstrating practical applicability in both simulation and physical experiments.

Abstract: Aerial manipulation combines the maneuverability of multirotors with the
dexterity of robotic arms to perform complex tasks in cluttered spaces. Yet
planning safe, dynamically feasible trajectories remains difficult due to
whole-body collision avoidance and the conservativeness of common geometric
abstractions such as bounding boxes or ellipsoids. We present a whole-body
motion planning and safety-critical control framework for aerial manipulators
built on superquadrics (SQs). Using an SQ-plus-proxy representation, we model
both the vehicle and obstacles with differentiable, geometry-accurate surfaces.
Leveraging this representation, we introduce a maximum-clearance planner that
fuses Voronoi diagrams with an equilibrium-manifold formulation to generate
smooth, collision-aware trajectories. We further design a safety-critical
controller that jointly enforces thrust limits and collision avoidance via
high-order control barrier functions. In simulation, our approach outperforms
sampling-based planners in cluttered environments, producing faster, safer, and
smoother trajectories and exceeding ellipsoid-based baselines in geometric
fidelity. Actual experiments on a physical aerial-manipulation platform confirm
feasibility and robustness, demonstrating consistent performance across
simulation and hardware settings. The video can be found at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces OmniPianist, the first robotic agent capable of performing nearly 1,000 music pieces autonomously and without human demonstrations, by employing novel learning techniques and large-scale data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance robotics by achieving human-level dexterity, specifically tackling the demanding task of bimanual robotic piano playing which involves high-dimensional, contact-rich, and precise control.

Method: The authors developed a three-step method: 1) An automatic fingering strategy based on Optimal Transport to discover piano-playing strategies without demonstrations, 2) large-scale Reinforcement Learning with 2,000 specialized agents to form the RP1M++ dataset, and 3) using a Flow Matching Transformer for imitation learning on this dataset.

Result: The OmniPianist agent was successfully developed, capable of playing almost 1,000 musical pieces. Experiments and ablation studies validated the approach's effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: OmniPianist represents a significant advancement in robotic fine motor skills and scalable learning, enabling complex bimanual tasks like robot piano playing without requiring human demonstrations.

Abstract: Endowing robot hands with human-level dexterity has been a long-standing goal
in robotics. Bimanual robotic piano playing represents a particularly
challenging task: it is high-dimensional, contact-rich, and requires fast,
precise control. We present OmniPianist, the first agent capable of performing
nearly one thousand music pieces via scalable, human-demonstration-free
learning. Our approach is built on three core components. First, we introduce
an automatic fingering strategy based on Optimal Transport (OT), allowing the
agent to autonomously discover efficient piano-playing strategies from scratch
without demonstrations. Second, we conduct large-scale Reinforcement Learning
(RL) by training more than 2,000 agents, each specialized in distinct music
pieces, and aggregate their experience into a dataset named RP1M++, consisting
of over one million trajectories for robotic piano playing. Finally, we employ
a Flow Matching Transformer to leverage RP1M++ through large-scale imitation
learning, resulting in the OmniPianist agent capable of performing a wide range
of musical pieces. Extensive experiments and ablation studies highlight the
effectiveness and scalability of our approach, advancing dexterous robotic
piano playing at scale.

*Seth Stewart,Joseph Pawelski,Steve Ward,Andrew J. Petruska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores closed-loop magnetic manipulation of conductive, non-magnetic objects to enable 3D position control, focusing on recycling space debris using induced eddy currents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand the applications of magnetic manipulation to conductive, non-magnetic objects, particularly for recycling space debris in low-force environments.

Method: Closed-loop control using oscillating magnetic fields with an induced eddy current dipole moment, demonstrated through experiments with a semi-buoyant aluminum sphere.

Result: Successful implementation of closed-loop position control for a semi-buoyant aluminum sphere, and evaluation of several force inversion methods.

Conclusion: Closed-loop methods provide a key step toward broader application of magnetic manipulation for 3-DOF control of conductive objects, enabling new possibilities in recycling space debris.

Abstract: Extending the field of magnetic manipulation to conductive, non-magnetic
objects opens the door for a wide array of applications previously limited to
hard or soft magnetic materials. Of particular interest is the recycling of
space debris through the use of oscillating magnetic fields, which represent a
cache of raw materials in an environment particularly suited to the low forces
generated from inductive magnetic manipulation. Building upon previous work
that demonstrated 3D open-loop position control by leveraging the opposing
dipole moment created from induced eddy currents, this work demonstrates
closed-loop position control of a semi-buoyant aluminum sphere in lab tests,
and the efficacy of varying methods for force inversion is explored. The
closed-loop methods represent a critical first step towards wider applications
for 3-DOF position control of induced magnetic dipoles.

*Shichao Fan,Kun Wu,Zhengping Che,Xinhua Wang,Di Wu,Fei Liao,Ning Liu,Yixue Zhang,Zhen Zhao,Zhiyuan Xu,Meng Li,Qingjie Liu,Shanghang Zhang,Min Wan,Jian Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Paper introduces XR-1 framework for vision-language-action (VLA) learning, overcoming challenges in multi-modal knowledge utilization and domain gaps via Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC). Achieved strong performance across diverse robotic embodiments and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in low-level action precision and domain gaps in VLA models due to heterogeneous robot data and tasks.

Method: Developed the XR-1 framework using Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC) with a dual-branch VQ-VAE encoder for visual and motion alignment, supported by a three-stage training paradigm.

Result: XR-1 outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in more than 14,000 real-world robot tasks, showcasing generalization capabilities across novel objects and environmental changes.

Conclusion: XR-1 effectively addresses core VLA challenges, demonstrating versatility and scalability in robotic tasks and advancing the state-of-the-art in robotics applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models
(VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However,
existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing
precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging
domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot
embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent
variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy
learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal
knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we
present X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable
VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces
the \emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation
learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and
robotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an
intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)
aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to
capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a
three-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)
UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and
(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive
real-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot
embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\pi_{0.5}$, $\pi_0$, RDT,
UniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel
objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes. Our

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces TWIST2, a portable system for humanoid robot teleoperation and data collection, which eliminates the need for motion capture and provides scalable, efficient methods for whole-body control and dataset generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current challenges in humanoid robotics are the lack of effective data collection systems and the dependency on costly motion capture setups in existing teleoperation systems.

Method: TWIST2 utilizes PICO4U VR for real-time human motion capture and a low-cost 2-DoF robot neck for egocentric vision. It ensures holistic human-to-humanoid control and features a hierarchical visuomotor policy for autonomous full-body control of humanoid robots.

Result: The system achieved long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills, collecting 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with near 100% success rate. The visuomotor policies successfully executed whole-body dexterous manipulation and dynamic tasks.

Conclusion: TWIST2 advances scalable humanoid robotics by eliminating motion capture needs and providing a reproducible, open-source framework for data collection and autonomous control. This can significantly enhance data generation and real-life capability development in humanoid robotics.

Abstract: Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models
to vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid
robotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid
teleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive
motion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid
teleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control
while advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining
real-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around
$250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We
demonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can
collect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.
Building on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy
framework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric
vision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous
manipulation and dynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible
and open-sourced at https://yanjieze.com/TWIST2 . Our collected dataset is also

### [268] [Detecting Vulnerabilities from Issue Reports for Internet-of-Things](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01941)
*Sogol Masoumzadeh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of detecting software vulnerability issues in IoT systems using ML and LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for detecting vulnerability-related issues are effective for non-IoT systems but are underexplored for IoT systems, where analysis is typically slower.

Method: The paper introduces two approaches: (1) combining ML and LLMs with NLP techniques for detecting issues in 21 Eclipse IoT projects, and (2) fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model on 11,000 GitHub issues for binary classification of vulnerabilities.

Result: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on BERT NLP features achieved the highest AUC of 0.65, while the fine-tuned BERT model achieved an accuracy of 0.26.

Conclusion: The study establishes foundational work for accurately detecting IoT vulnerabilities using ML and NLP techniques, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive data training.

Abstract: Timely identification of issue reports reflecting software vulnerabilities is
crucial, particularly for Internet-of-Things (IoT) where analysis is slower
than non-IoT systems. While Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) detect vulnerability-indicating issues in non-IoT systems, their IoT use
remains unexplored. We are the first to tackle this problem by proposing two
approaches: (1) combining ML and LLMs with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques to detect vulnerability-indicating issues of 21 Eclipse IoT projects
and (2) fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT Masked Language Model (MLM) on 11,000
GitHub issues for classifying \vul. Our best performance belongs to a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) trained on BERT NLP features, achieving an Area Under the
receiver operator characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.65. The fine-tuned BERT
achieves 0.26 accuracy, emphasizing the importance of exposing all data during
training. Our contributions set the stage for accurately detecting IoT
vulnerabilities from issue reports, similar to non-IoT systems.

### [269] [Metamorphic Testing of Large Language Models for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02108)
*Steven Cho,Stefano Ruberto,Valerio Terragni*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on using metamorphic testing (MT) to automatically identify incorrect results in large language models (LLMs), addressing challenges such as limited labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are effective for natural language processing tasks but can often produce incorrect outputs, making it critical to identify faulty behaviors and improve their reliability.

Method: The authors performed a literature review to collect 191 metamorphic relations (MRs) for NLP tasks. They implemented 36 representative MRs and conducted approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests across three popular LLMs.

Result: The experiments revealed insights into both the capabilities and limitations of using MT to evaluate and enhance LLM performance.

Conclusion: Metamorphic testing shows promise for identifying incorrect behaviors in LLMs, but it has limitations, requiring further investigation for broader and more robust applications.

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to perform natural language processing
(NLP) tasks has become increasingly pervasive in recent times. The versatile
nature of LLMs makes them applicable to a wide range of such tasks. While the
performance of recent LLMs is generally outstanding, several studies have shown
that they can often produce incorrect results. Automatically identifying these
faulty behaviors is extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of LLMs.
One obstacle to this is the limited availability of labeled datasets, which
necessitates an oracle to determine the correctness of LLM behaviors.
Metamorphic testing (MT) is a popular testing approach that alleviates this
oracle problem. At the core of MT are metamorphic relations (MRs), which define
relationships between the outputs of related inputs. MT can expose faulty
behaviors without the need for explicit oracles (e.g., labeled datasets). This
paper presents the most comprehensive study of MT for LLMs to date. We
conducted a literature review and collected 191 MRs for NLP tasks. We
implemented a representative subset (36 MRs) to conduct a series of experiments
with three popular LLMs, running approximately 560,000 metamorphic tests. The
results shed light on the capabilities and opportunities of MT for LLMs, as
well as its limitations.

*Shufan Wang,Xing Hu,Junkai Chen,Zhiyuan Pan,Xin Xia*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores confidence estimation in large language models (LLMs) for code reasoning tasks, proposing enhancements and demonstrating improvement in reliability using strategies like prompt optimization and mathematical calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliability and controllability of LLM outputs in code reasoning tasks, where confidence estimation is crucial for evaluation.

Method: A framework for confidence analysis and enhancement tailored to code reasoning tasks, incorporating empirical evaluations on mainstream LLMs and employing techniques like prompt strategy optimization and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling).

Result: DeepSeek-Reasoner outperforms other models across various tasks, showing significant improvement in metrics like ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score. Hybrid strategies further enhance results, showing substantial gains over original performance.

Conclusion: Confidence reliability in LLMs can be significantly improved, particularly in reasoning tasks, through effective strategies. However, challenges remain in complex tasks, suggesting room for future optimization and deployment of confidence mechanisms in code intelligence.

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in the field
of code intelligence, increasing attention has been paid to the reliability and
controllability of their outputs in code reasoning tasks. Confidence estimation
serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects.
This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs
tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on
the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and
further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy
optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving
confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the
best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to
$0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance
Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy
and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$
over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These
results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in
enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate
the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on
confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in
complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study
not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the
application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points
the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence
mechanisms.

*Gerhard Yu,Mithila Sivakumar,Alvine B. Belle,Soude Ghari,Song Wang,Timothy C. Lethbridge*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach using large language models (LLMs) for assurance case reviews to enhance efficiency and accuracy, with experimental results showing DeepSeek-R1 outperforming GPT-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assurance cases for mission-critical systems are extensive and error-prone, necessitating automated methods to improve their lifecycle efficiency, consistency, and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose leveraging LLMs using a novel 'LLM-as-a-judge' paradigm with predicate-based rules to formalize review criteria and create tailored prompts for automated assurance case reviews.

Result: Experimental analysis with state-of-the-art LLMs shows most models perform well for assurance case reviews, with DeepSeek-R1 achieving superior results compared to GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist in assurance case reviews, improving efficiency, but human reviewers are essential for refinement of the outputs.

Abstract: Assurance cases allow verifying the correct implementation of certain
non-functional requirements of mission-critical systems, including their
safety, security, and reliability. They can be used in the specification of
autonomous driving, avionics, air traffic control, and similar systems. They
aim to reduce risks of harm of all kinds including human mortality,
environmental damage, and financial loss. However, assurance cases often tend
to be organized as extensive documents spanning hundreds of pages, making their
creation, review, and maintenance error-prone, time-consuming, and tedious.
Therefore, there is a growing need to leverage (semi-)automated techniques,
such as those powered by generative AI and large language models (LLMs), to
enhance efficiency, consistency, and accuracy across the entire assurance-case
lifecycle. In this paper, we focus on assurance case review, a critical task
that ensures the quality of assurance cases and therefore fosters their
acceptance by regulatory authorities. We propose a novel approach that
leverages the \textit{LLM-as-a-judge} paradigm to automate the review process.
Specifically, we propose new predicate-based rules that formalize
well-established assurance case review criteria, allowing us to craft LLM
prompts tailored to the review task. Our experiments on several
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) show
that, while most LLMs yield relatively good review capabilities, DeepSeek-R1
and GPT-4.1 demonstrate superior performance, with DeepSeek-R1 ultimately
outperforming GPT-4.1. However, our experimental results also suggest that
human reviewers are still needed to refine the reviews LLMs yield.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWE-Sharp-Bench, a software engineering benchmark for the C# programming language, filling a gap in current benchmarks dominated by Python and other languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the lack of representation of C# in current software engineering benchmarks and the need to evaluate AI coding agents in a major enterprise language ranked #5 in popularity.

Method: The authors created SWE-Sharp-Bench using 150 coding tasks sourced from 17 repositories and conducted comparative evaluations of AI coding agents across languages.

Result: The study finds that AI coding agents perform significantly worse on C# tasks, with only 40% of tasks solved, compared to 70% for Python tasks in equivalent benchmarks.

Conclusion: This highlights the need for focused benchmarking and model improvement for underrepresented languages like C#. The benchmark and curation pipeline are open-sourced to foster future research.

Abstract: AI coding agents have shown great progress on Python software engineering
benchmarks like SWE-Bench, and for other languages like Java and C in
benchmarks like Multi-SWE-Bench. However, C# -- a prominent enterprise language
ranking #5 in the TIOBE index -- remains absent from such benchmarks. We
introduce SWE-Sharp-Bench, a reproducible software engineering benchmark for
C\# featuring 150 instances from 17 repositories. Evaluating identical
model-agent configurations across languages reveals a significant performance
gap: while 70% of Python tasks in SWE-Bench Verified are solved, $only 40% of
our C\# tasks are resolved. We open-source SWE-Sharp-Bench and our entire
curation pipeline.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoDev improves iterative software development by utilizing a Feature Map, outperforming existing models and providing insights for AI-driven development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model agents struggle with iterative real-world software development processes and fail on complex projects.

Method: EvoDev introduces a Feature Map to model dependencies between user-valued features and propagates multi-level context for iterative development.

Result: EvoDev significantly outperforms Claude Code by 56.8% in Android development tasks and boosts base LLMs’ single-agent performance by 16.0%-76.6%.

Conclusion: EvoDev demonstrates the importance of dependency modeling and context propagation, offering practical insights to enhance AI-based iterative development frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model agents offer the promise of
automating end-to-end software development from natural language requirements.
However, existing approaches largely adopt linear, waterfall-style pipelines,
which oversimplify the iterative nature of real-world development and struggle
with complex, large-scale projects. To address these limitations, we propose
EvoDev, an iterative software development framework inspired by feature-driven
development. EvoDev decomposes user requirements into a set of user-valued
features and constructs a Feature Map, a directed acyclic graph that explicitly
models dependencies between features. Each node in the feature map maintains
multi-level information, including business logic, design, and code, which is
propagated along dependencies to provide context for subsequent development
iterations. We evaluate EvoDev on challenging Android development tasks and
show that it outperforms the best-performing baseline, Claude Code, by a
substantial margin of 56.8%, while improving single-agent performance by
16.0%-76.6% across different base LLMs, highlighting the importance of
dependency modeling, context propagation, and workflow-aware agent design for
complex software projects. Our work summarizes practical insights for designing
iterative, LLM-driven development frameworks and informs future training of
base LLMs to better support iterative software development.

*Dominik Fuchß,Haoyu Liu,Sophie Corallo,Tobias Hey,Jan Keim,Johannes von Geisau,Anne Koziolek*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the generation of Software Architecture Models (SAMs) and enhancing traceability between software documentation and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of SAMs is highly time-consuming. Automated approaches leveraging LLMs can make this process efficient and practical for traceability link recovery in software systems.

Method: The paper introduces two LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts architectural entities directly from textual documentation and code, while ArTEMiS matches entities across manually or automatically created SAMs and documentation.

Result: ExArch matches the performance of state-of-the-art (F1: 0.86) without requiring manual SAMs, and ArTEMiS performs equivalently to heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) while replacing traditional methods when combined with TransArC.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential in automating SAM generation and architectural entity identification, improving the practicality of architecture-code traceability, and reducing reliance on manual methods.

Abstract: Identifying architecturally relevant entities in textual artifacts is crucial
for Traceability Link Recovery (TLR) between Software Architecture
Documentation (SAD) and source code. While Software Architecture Models (SAMs)
can bridge the semantic gap between these artifacts, their manual creation is
time-consuming. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new capabilities for
extracting architectural entities from SAD and source code to construct SAMs
automatically or establish direct trace links. This paper presents two
LLM-based approaches: ExArch extracts component names as simple SAMs from SAD
and source code to eliminate the need for manual SAM creation, while ArTEMiS
identifies architectural entities in documentation and matches them with
(manually or automatically generated) SAM entities. Our evaluation compares
against state-of-the-art approaches SWATTR, TransArC and ArDoCode. TransArC
achieves strong performance (F1: 0.87) but requires manually created SAMs;
ExArch achieves comparable results (F1: 0.86) using only SAD and code. ArTEMiS
is on par with the traditional heuristic-based SWATTR (F1: 0.81) and can
successfully replace it when integrated with TransArC. The combination of
ArTEMiS and ExArch outperforms ArDoCode, the best baseline without manual SAMs.
Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively identify architectural
entities in textual artifacts, enabling automated SAM generation and TLR,
making architecture-code traceability more practical and accessible.

*Eriks Klotins,Magnus Ahlgren,Nicolas Martin Vivaldi,Even-Andre Karlsson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores challenges in adopting Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) within complex and constrained organizational contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand limitations in adopting CSE due to factors like legacy systems, regulatory demands, and organizational inertia, especially in different industrial sectors.

Method: Applied a previously proposed CSE Industry Readiness Model in four industrial cases using expert interviews and narrative synthesis to update the model and identify driving forces and barriers.

Result: Proposed an updated readiness model with improved levels for feedback loops, constraints analysis, and practical adoption strategies for CSE.

Conclusion: Even without full CSE adoption, internal improvements are feasible, offering organizations guidance for partial or constrained transitions towards CSE.

Abstract: Purpose: Continuous Software Engineering (CSE) promises improved efficiency,
quality, and responsiveness in software-intensive organizations. However, fully
adopting CSE is often constrained by complex products, legacy systems,
organizational inertia, and regulatory requirements. In this paper, we examine
four industrial cases from the automation, automotive, retail, and chemical
sectors to explore how such constraints shape CSE adoption in practice.
Methods: We apply and extend a previously proposed CSE Industry Readiness Model
to assess the current and potential levels of adoption in each case. Through
expert interviews and narrative synthesis, we identify common driving forces
and adoption barriers, including organizational preparedness,
cross-organizational dependencies, and limited customer demand for continuous
delivery. Results: Based on our findings, we propose an updated readiness model
that introduces additional levels of internal and external feedback,
distinguishes market- and organization-facing constraints, and better guides
practitioners in setting realistic CSE adoption goals. Conclusions: Our results
highlight that while full end-to-end CSE adoption may not always be feasible,
meaningful internal improvements are still possible and beneficial. This study
provides empirically grounded guidance for organizations navigating partial or
constrained CSE transformations.

*Jürgen Cito,Dominik Bork*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Generative AI enables swift software creation via natural language, but results in fragile systems. Models are proposed as post-hoc tools to enhance robustness and sustainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the challenges created by Generative AI's ability to quickly produce software, focusing on the fragile nature of such systems regarding robustness, security, and maintainability.

Method: The authors advocate using models recovered after AI-generated code creation, emphasizing their role in restoring comprehension, identifying risks, and aiding refinement.

Result: Post-hoc models act as mediators connecting human intent, AI-generated content, and system sustainability, supporting a new paradigm in AI-driven software engineering.

Conclusion: A reimagining of software modeling is necessary for sustainable, AI-driven software creation, ensuring systems are robust, secure, and maintainable.

Abstract: Generative AI enables rapid ``vibe coding," where natural language prompts
yield working software systems. While this lowers barriers to software
creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered
software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and
maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software
models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered
post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and
guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent,
AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward
sustainable AI-driven software engineering.

### [277] [ReleaseEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models in Automated Release Note Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02713)
*Qianru Meng,Zhaochun Ren,Joost Visser*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReleaseEval introduces a benchmark for automated release note generation, highlighting improvements using LLMs but emphasizing their limitations with detailed code diffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of release notes for software updates is inefficient and error-prone, necessitating automated solutions to improve the process.

Method: A benchmark named ReleaseEval evaluates language models using 94,987 release notes from diverse repositories, incorporating varying levels of granularity in data: commit messages, commit tree structures, and fine-grained code diffs.

Result: Large language models outperform traditional methods in automated release note generation, excelling with structured data but struggling to abstract fine-grained code diffs.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in leveraging structured contexts, further work is needed to address challenges in summarizing detailed code changes effectively.

Abstract: Automated release note generation addresses the challenge of documenting
frequent software updates, where manual efforts are time-consuming and prone to
human error. Although recent advances in language models further enhance this
process, progress remains hindered by dataset limitations, including the lack
of explicit licensing and limited reproducibility, and incomplete task design
that relies mainly on commit messages for summarization while overlooking
fine-grained contexts such as commit hierarchies and code changes. To fill this
gap, we introduce ReleaseEval, a reproducible and openly licensed benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate language models for automated release note
generation. ReleaseEval comprises 94,987 release notes from 3,369 repositories
across 6 programming languages, and supports three task settings with three
levels of input granularity: (1) commit2sum, which generates release notes from
commit messages; (2) tree2sum, which incorporates commit tree structures; and
(3) diff2sum, which leverages fine-grained code diffs. Both automated and human
evaluations show that large language models consistently outperform traditional
baselines across all tasks, achieving substantial gains on tree2sum, while
still struggling on diff2sum. These findings highlight LLMs' proficiency in
leveraging structured information while revealing challenges in abstracting
from long code diffs.

### [278] [Investigating the Experience of Autistic Individuals in Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02736)
*Madalena Sasportes,Grischa Liebel,Miguel Goulão*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores strengths of autistic software engineers, emphasizing their logical thinking, attention to detail, hyperfocus, and comfort with AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve inclusion of autistic adults in software engineering by emphasizing strengths rather than challenges.

Method: Social-Technical Grounded Theory combining semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic engineers and surveys with 49 respondents (including 5 autistic participants).

Result: Autistic engineers excel in logical thinking, attention to detail, hyperfocus, learning programming languages, and prefer remote work and written communication.

Conclusion: The study highlights evidence on the strengths of autistic software engineers, supporting their potential contributions in software engineering.

Abstract: Context: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) leads to various issues in the
everyday life of autistic individuals, often resulting in unemployment and
mental health problems. To improve the inclusion of autistic adults, existing
studies have highlighted the strengths these individuals possess in comparison
to non-autistic individuals, e.g., high attention to detail or excellent
logical reasoning skills. If fostered, these strengths could be valuable in
software engineering activities, such for identifying specific kinds of bugs in
code. However, existing work in SE has primarily studied the challenges of
autistic individuals and possible accommodations, with little attention their
strengths. Objective: Our goal is to analyse the experiences of autistic
individuals in software engineering activities, such as code reviews, with a
particular emphasis on strengths. Methods: This study combines Social-Technical
Grounded Theory through semi-structured interviews with 16 autistic software
engineers and a survey with 49 respondents, including 5 autistic participants.
We compare the emerging themes with the theory by Gama et al. on the Effect of
Neurodivergent Cognitive Dysfunctions in Software Engineering Performance.
Results: Our results suggest that autistic software engineers are often skilled
in logical thinking, attention to detail, and hyperfocus in programming; and
they enjoy learning new programming languages and programming-related
technologies. Confirming previous work, they tend to prefer written
communication and remote work. Finally, we report a high comfort level in
interacting with AI-based systems. Conclusions: Our findings extend existing
work by providing further evidence on the strengths of autistic software
engineers.

### [279] [Formalizing Regression Testing for Agile and Continuous Integration Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02810)
*Suddhasvatta Das,Kevin Gary*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper formalizes the concept of continuous regression testing in agile software development, introducing a time-ordered chain model and regression test window.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agile practices demand continuous regression testing due to frequent software version deliveries, requiring an updated theoretical model beyond classical regression-testing practices.

Method: The authors developed a mathematical model treating successive software builds as a chain with a defined regression test window, validated through representation of agile regression testing algorithms and proving the formalization's soundness and completeness.

Result: The formalization effectively represents contemporary agile regression testing algorithms without additional assumptions, maintaining classical regression-testing semantics with infinite time limits.

Conclusion: This formalization bridges the gap between classical regression testing and agile development needs, providing a robust theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Software developed using modern agile practices delivers a stream of software
versions that require continuous regression testing rather than testing once
close to the delivery or maintenance phase, as assumed by classical
regression-testing theory. In this work, we formalize the phenomenon of
continuous or near-continuous regression testing using successive builds as a
time-ordered chain, where each build contains the program, requirements, and
the accompanying tests. We also formalize the regression test window between
any two builds, which captures the limited time budget available for regression
testing. As the time limit is set to infinity and the chain is closed to two
builds, the model degenerates to retest-all, thereby preserving semantics for
the classical two-version case. The formalization is validated by directly
representing two state-of-the-art agile regression testing algorithms in terms
of build-tuple operations without requiring auxiliary assumptions, followed by
proof of the soundness and completeness of our formalization.

### [280] [From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827)
*Mohamed Almukhtar,Anwar Ghammam,Marouane Kessentini,Hua Ming*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces PyQu, a tool for assessing impact of code changes on software quality in Python-based ML systems through an extensive analysis of 3,340 projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of tools linking code changes with software quality effects in Python-based ML systems.

Method: Conducted large-scale study of 3,340 open-source projects, using PyQu to assess quality-enhancing commits and thematic analysis to categorize impactful changes.

Result: PyQu achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall scores, identifying 61 impactful code changes categorized into 13 contexts, with 41% being newly recognized changes.

Conclusion: PyQu lays groundwork to improve automated quality assessment and practices in Python-based ML systems, addressing software quality concerns effectively.

Abstract: In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation
and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS),
software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in
complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how
specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack
of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes
and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in
MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of
the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap,
we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML
projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of
code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics
to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and
recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic
analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on
enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on
contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our
study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection
tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners,
educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality
assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.

### [281] [Condition-Invariant fMRI Decoding of Speech Intelligibility with Deep State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01868)
*Ching-Chih Sung,Shuntaro Suzuki,Francis Pingfan Chien,Komei Sugiura,Yu Tsao*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep state space model to decode speech intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions using fMRI signals, uncovering condition-invariant neural codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the neural mechanisms underlying speech intelligibility, especially in diverse listening environments, and address limitations of previous studies that focused primarily on clean speech.

Method: The authors developed a novel deep state space model tailored to the high-dimensional temporal structure of fMRI data, enabling the decoding of intelligibility across different acoustic conditions.

Result: The method outperformed classical approaches in decoding intelligibility and revealed that auditory, frontal, and parietal brain regions play significant roles, identifying condition-invariant neural codes.

Conclusion: The findings enhance the understanding of how the brain represents abstract linguistic information in varied auditory environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for
computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging
studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond
simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri.
However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving
it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across
diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel
architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility
from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal
structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across
acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms
classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights
contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition
transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby
advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.

TL;DR: CytoNet is a foundation model that analyzes the organization and cellular details of the cerebral cortex using high-resolution microscopic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the human brain through its cortical architecture and cellular details, traditional approaches rely heavily on manual labeling.

Method: CytoNet uses self-supervised learning based on spatial proximity to train on high-resolution microscopic images without manual labeling.

Result: CytoNet achieves high performance in tasks such as cortical area classification, layer segmentation, cell morphology estimation, and unsupervised brain region mapping.

Conclusion: CytoNet provides a unified framework for studying cortical microarchitecture, enabling broader neuroscientific research and connections with other brain structure-function analyses.

Abstract: To study how the human brain works, we need to explore the organization of
the cerebral cortex and its detailed cellular architecture. We introduce
CytoNet, a foundation model that encodes high-resolution microscopic image
patches of the cerebral cortex into highly expressive feature representations,
enabling comprehensive brain analyses. CytoNet employs self-supervised learning
using spatial proximity as a powerful training signal, without requiring manual
labelling. The resulting features are anatomically sound and biologically
relevant. They encode general aspects of cortical architecture and unique
brain-specific traits. We demonstrate top-tier performance in tasks such as
cortical area classification, cortical layer segmentation, cell morphology
estimation, and unsupervised brain region mapping. As a foundation model,
CytoNet offers a consistent framework for studying cortical microarchitecture,
supporting analyses of its relationship with other structural and functional
brain features, and paving the way for diverse neuroscientific investigations.

*Dale Zhou,Danielle Cosme,Yoona Kang,Ovidia Stanoi,David M. Lydon-Staley,Peter J. Mucha,Emily B. Falk,Kevin N. Ochsner,Dani S. Bassett*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper discusses the history and advancements in cognitive control research, focusing on how brain regions regulate and implement goal-oriented behavior despite uncertainties, and introduces network control theory as a significant contribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores cognitive control as a neural process and aims to address its incomplete understanding as a cohesive and distributed mechanism within the brain.

Method: The authors examine previous studies, critique models, and introduce network control theory as a mathematical and systemic approach to understand brain-controlled dynamics for achieving cognitive tasks.

Result: Network control theory integrates established evidence, provides tools for understanding control regions in the brain, and offers predictive capabilities about control behavior and signaling in cognitive processes.

Conclusion: The paper highlights future research directions for synthesizing classical and modern approaches, including network control theory, to achieve more holistic insights about cognitive control mechanisms in the brain.

Abstract: Cognitive control is a suite of processes that helps individuals pursue goals
despite resistance or uncertainty about what to do. Although cognitive control
has been extensively studied as a dynamic feedback loop of perception,
valuation, and action, it remains incompletely understood as a cohesive dynamic
and distributed neural process. Here, we critically examine the history of and
advances in the study of cognitive control, including how metaphors and
cultural norms of power, morality, and rationality are intertwined with
definitions of control, to consider holistically how different models explain
which brain regions act as controllers. Controllers, the source of top-down
signals, are typically localized in regions whose neural activations implement
elementary component processes of control, including conflict monitoring and
behavioral inhibition. Top-down signals from these regions guide the activation
of other task-specific regions, biasing them towards task-specific activity
patterns. A relatively new approach, network control theory, has roots in
dynamical systems theory and systems engineering. This approach can
mathematically show that controllers are regions with strongly nested and
recurrent anatomical connectivity that efficiently propagate top-down signals,
and precisely estimate the amount, location, and timing of signaling required
to bias global activity to task-specific patterns. The theory converges with
prior evidence, offers new mathematical tools and intuitions for understanding
control loops across levels of analysis, and naturally produces graded
predictions of control across brain regions and modules of psychological
function that have been unconsidered or marginalized. We describe how prior
approaches converge and diverge, noting directions for future integration to
improve understanding of how the brain instantiates cognitive control.

*Subati Abulikemu,Puria Radmard,Michail Mamalakis,John Suckling*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study explores changes in the sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy in schizophrenia using fMRI data and computational modeling, revealing reduced functional differentiation, altered neural dynamics, and connections to disrupted cognitive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate how schizophrenia impacts the sensory-to-association hierarchy in the neocortex, an important organizational feature for functional brain differentiation and cognitive processing.

Method: Researchers used fMRI data from 355 individuals to analyze AS gradients using spectral analysis and modeling of neural timescales with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Computational modeling with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) was also employed to study the impact of gradient spread on cognitive tasks.

Result: The study finds that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy, reducing functional differentiation. It also reveals that regions with longer time constants in neural dynamics have their effects attenuated in schizophrenia, signaling altered cortical hierarchies and dynamics. Gradient-regularised RNNs demonstrated the importance of gradient spread in stable and efficient task learning.

Conclusion: Schizophrenia appears to destabilize neural computations by compressing functional hierarchies and altering cortical dynamics. Gradient-regularised RNNs served as a framework connecting large-scale cortical changes to impairments in cognitive processing and neural stability in schizophrenia.

Abstract: The human neocortex is functionally organised at its highest level along a
continuous sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy. This study characterises the
AS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls.
Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via
spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation
by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We
found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced
functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally
cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time
constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation,
we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient
spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained
stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point
linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural
states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal
Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links
large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a
mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural
computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale
flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study highlights the gut microbiota's critical role in regulating sleep through its influence on the gut-microbiota-brain axis, neurochemistry, and immune responses, and explores microbiota-targeted therapies to manage sleep issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to elucidate the deep connection between sleep physiology and gut microbiota to address sleep and associated systemic disorders.

Method: This is a review paper that integrates recent findings on gut microbiota's influence on sleep and examines therapeutic interventions like probiotics, FMT, and chrononutrition.

Result: Gut dysbiosis is linked to sleep disturbances, affecting neurotransmitter activity and immune responses, with broader implications for neurodegenerative, metabolic, and mood disorders.

Conclusion: Targeting the gut microbiota holds promise for potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and enhance overall health.

Abstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep
physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the
gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system
modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic
homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to
sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent
findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by
altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with
implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood
disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and
immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation
mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and
the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted
therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and
chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and
improve health outcomes

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a Gaussian process framework to learn interaction kernels in multi-species systems, overcoming challenges like heterogeneity, asymmetric interactions, and scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling complex macroscopic behaviors arising from simple microscopic interaction rules in multi-species systems.

Method: A nonparametric Bayesian framework for learning interaction kernels, with rigorous statistical guarantees, error bounds, and numerical experiments.

Result: Proposed method recovers interaction kernels effectively, provides optimal statistical estimators, and outperforms existing methods in numerical tests.

Conclusion: This study provides a statistically sound and generalizable framework for inferring interaction laws, contributing to multiscale modeling and understanding emergent behaviors in multi-species systems.

Abstract: We develop a Gaussian process framework for learning interaction kernels in
multi-species interacting particle systems from trajectory data. Such systems
provide a canonical setting for multiscale modeling, where simple microscopic
interaction rules generate complex macroscopic behaviors. While our earlier
work established a Gaussian process approach and convergence theory for
single-species systems, and later extended to second-order models with
alignment and energy-type interactions, the multi-species setting introduces
new challenges: heterogeneous populations interact both within and across
species, the number of unknown kernels grows, and asymmetric interactions such
as predator-prey dynamics must be accommodated. We formulate the learning
problem in a nonparametric Bayesian setting and establish rigorous statistical
guarantees. Our analysis shows recoverability of the interaction kernels,
provides quantitative error bounds, and proves statistical optimality of
posterior estimators, thereby unifying and generalizing previous single-species
theory. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions and
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its
advantages over existing kernel-based methods. This work contributes a complete
statistical framework for data-driven inference of interaction laws in
multi-species systems, advancing the broader multiscale modeling program of
connecting microscopic particle dynamics with emergent macroscopic behavior.

TL;DR: DoFlow integrates causal reasoning and generative modeling using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) for accurate observational, interventional, and counterfactual forecasting in complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting demands accuracy in both observational and causal predictions, including scenarios involving interventions and counterfactuals in multivariate systems.

Method: DoFlow employs a flow-based generative model aligned with a causal DAG, leveraging CNFs to provide natural encoding, decoding, likelihood estimation, and anomaly detection.

Result: The experiments demonstrate DoFlow's precision in observational forecasting, causal forecasting through interventions and counterfactual queries, and its ability to detect anomalies in synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DoFlow is a promising approach to unify causal reasoning and generative modeling, offering robust forecasting and anomaly detection in dynamic systems.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting increasingly demands not only accurate observational
predictions but also causal forecasting under interventional and counterfactual
queries in multivariate systems. We present DoFlow, a flow based generative
model defined over a causal DAG that delivers coherent observational and
interventional predictions, as well as counterfactuals through the natural
encoding and decoding mechanism of continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). We also
provide a supporting counterfactual recovery result under certain assumptions.
Beyond forecasting, DoFlow provides explicit likelihoods of future
trajectories, enabling principled anomaly detection. Experiments on synthetic
datasets with various causal DAG and real world hydropower and cancer treatment
time series show that DoFlow achieves accurate system-wide observational
forecasting, enables causal forecasting over interventional and counterfactual
queries, and effectively detects anomalies. This work contributes to the
broader goal of unifying causal reasoning and generative modeling for complex
dynamical systems.

TL;DR: This paper examines high-dimensional scaling limits of SGD for single-layer networks, focusing on critical step size regimes and stochastic fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stochastic fluctuations impact SGD dynamics in high-dimensional settings and evaluate limitations of deterministic scaling models.

Method: The study analyzes critical scaling regimes and introduces stochastic differential equation (SDE) corrections like Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.

Result: Key insights link the information exponent to sample complexity, revealing critical changes in SGD dynamics beyond deterministic models.

Conclusion: The research bridges deterministic and stochastic limits, showing that classic ballistic models inadequately represent fluctuations during high-dimensional learning dynamics.

Abstract: This paper studies the high-dimensional scaling limits of online stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) for single-layer networks. Building on the seminal work
of Saad and Solla, which analyzed the deterministic (ballistic) scaling limits
of SGD corresponding to the gradient flow of the population loss, we focus on
the critical scaling regime of the step size. Below this critical scale, the
effective dynamics are governed by ballistic (ODE) limits, but at the critical
scale, new correction term appears that changes the phase diagram. In this
regime, near the fixed points, the corresponding diffusive (SDE) limits of the
effective dynamics reduces to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process under certain
conditions. These results highlight how the information exponent controls
sample complexity and illustrates the limitations of deterministic scaling
limit in capturing the stochastic fluctuations of high-dimensional learning
dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper provides a novel approach to efficiently sample Markov Random Fields (MRF) by mapping them to Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF), achieving significant computational and energy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling MRFs, like Potts or Ising models, via Gibbs sampling is computationally expensive. The work seeks to address this inefficiency by exploring connections with GMRFs.

Method: The authors propose a mapping from real-valued GMRFs to discrete-valued MRFs, leveraging GMRF sampling methods to improve efficiency.

Result: The new MRF sampling methods are shown to be at least 35x faster and use at least 37x less energy than traditional Gibbs sampling while maintaining properties close to classical MRFs.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a new, efficient MRF model with validated theoretical properties, demonstrating drastic improvements in performance and energy consumption compared to Gibbs sampling.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of efficient sampling of Markov random fields
(MRF). The sampling of Potts or Ising MRF is most often based on Gibbs
sampling, and is thus computationally expensive. We consider in this work how
to circumvent this bottleneck through a link with Gaussian Markov Random
fields. The latter can be sampled in several cost-effective ways, and we
introduce a mapping from real-valued GMRF to discrete-valued MRF. The resulting
new class of MRF benefits from a few theoretical properties that validate the
new model. Numerical results show the drastic performance gain in terms of
computational efficiency, as we sample at least 35x faster than Gibbs sampling
using at least 37x less energy, all the while exhibiting empirical properties
close to classical MRFs.

TL;DR: A framework is proposed to efficiently detect local concept drift in regression tasks with limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of concept drift and label scarcity in predictive models, particularly in dynamic industrial environments.

Method: An adaptive sampling framework combining residual-based exploration and EWMA monitoring for efficient drift detection under limited labeling budgets.

Result: Empirical results show improved label efficiency and drift detection accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and an electricity market case study.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for detecting local concept drift in regression tasks, balancing efficiency and accuracy under constraints.

Abstract: Concept drift and label scarcity are two critical challenges limiting the
robustness of predictive models in dynamic industrial environments. Existing
drift detection methods often assume global shifts and rely on dense
supervision, making them ill-suited for regression tasks with local drifts and
limited labels. This paper proposes an adaptive sampling framework that
combines residual-based exploration and exploitation with EWMA monitoring to
efficiently detect local concept drift under labeling budget constraints.
Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks and a case study on electricity

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel algorithm for generating low-discrepancy samples via kernel discrepancies, enabling efficient subset selection in quasi-Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods by addressing the subset selection problem for generating low-discrepancy samples, which is critical for accurate integration and sampling.

Method: A novel subset selection algorithm is proposed for kernel discrepancies, allowing efficient generation of low-discrepancy samples for general distributions using kernel Stein discrepancy.

Result: The study provides a framework for subset selection in kernel discrepancies, achieves low-discrepancy sampling from both unit hypercube uniform distribution and general distributions, and examines relationships between $L_2$ and $L_$ star discrepancies.

Conclusion: The algorithm enhances QMC methods through improved sample selection across various distributions and adds insights into discrepancy measures, making it broadly applicable in numerical analysis.

Abstract: Kernel discrepancies are a powerful tool for analyzing worst-case errors in
quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Building on recent advances in optimizing such
discrepancy measures, we extend the subset selection problem to the setting of
kernel discrepancies, selecting an m-element subset from a large population of
size $n \gg m$. We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to
general kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples
from both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional
setting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known
density functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy. We also explore
the relationship between the classical $L_2$ star discrepancy and its
$L_\infty$ counterpart.

*Leonardo Cázares-Trejo,Marco Loreto-Silva,Huziel E. Sauceda*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel model, \(\Delta\)-sGDML, to address challenges in machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) for accurately learning noncovalent and covalent interactions in molecular systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately capturing noncovalent interactions alongside covalent forces in MLFFs remains challenging, especially with existing global models using Coulomb-matrix descriptors, which overrepresent intermolecular features and degrade force-field fidelity.

Method: The proposed \(\Delta\)-sGDML framework decouples intra- and intermolecular physics by training fragment-specific models and a dedicated binding model, then composing them during inference.

Result: \(\Delta\)-sGDML achieves up to 75% reduction in fragment-resolved force errors without energy accuracy loss. It produces stable molecular dynamics simulations, outperforming single global models across diverse molecular systems and temperature ranges.

Conclusion: This method provides a practical and scalable approach to improve MLFFs by addressing noncovalent physics and ensuring reliable force field performance across varying conditions.

Abstract: Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding,
ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent
phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them
alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force
fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use
Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in
multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly
covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular
features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To
address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation
within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular
physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding
model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest
complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water,
and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a
single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to
\textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics
simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force
field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide
range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses
stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize
per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates efficient uniform circuits for generating the basis polynomial of regular matroids and applies this to linear programming theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore computational improvements in matroid theory and its implications for linear programming structures.

Method: Proving the existence of efficient $(+,,/)$ circuits, leveraging Seymour's decomposition, and utilizing tropicalization for further applications.

Result: Efficient $O(n^3)$ circuits and ReLU neural networks were formulated, showcasing superiority in extended formulations.

Conclusion: This research advances matroid theory computations and highlights the potential of virtual extended formulations as a promising tool in linear programming.

Abstract: We prove that there exist uniform $(+,\times,/)$-circuits of size $O(n^3)$ to
compute the basis generating polynomial of regular matroids on $n$ elements. By
tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits
and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of
regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a
first example where taking the difference of two extended formulations can be
more efficient than the best known individual extended formulation of size
$O(n^6)$ by Aprile and Fiorini. Such differences have recently been introduced
as virtual extended formulations. The proof of our main result relies on a
fine-tuned version of Seymour's decomposition of regular matroids which allows
us to identify and maintain graphic substructures to which we can apply a local
version of the star-mesh transformation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable task offloading in real-time edge computing requires accurate latency prediction without active probing methods.

Method: A rational modeling approach utilizing features like frame size, arrival rate, and link utilization, tested extensively with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy (MAE = 0.0115, R$^2$ = 0.9847) and competitive inference time compared to regressors and neural networks.

eliminating the need for intrusive active probing. The model achieves
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy through extensive experiments and 5-fold

*Farhad Rezazadeh,Hatim Chergui,Merouane Debbah,Houbing Song,Dusit Niyato,Lingjia Liu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an advanced approach for enhancing sixth-generation (6G) networks by integrating predictive and decision-making capabilities using a world modeling (WM) paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to redefine intelligent capabilities in 6G networks, transitioning from simple prediction to advanced simulation, decision-making, and uncertainty management.

Method: The proposed method uses a world modeling (WM) paradigm to create action-conditioned generative state spaces for forecasting. It integrates multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic latent space (WM-MS3M) to improve performance metrics while reducing computational requirements.

Result: The WM-MS3M method reduced mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% compared to MS3M, achieved 35-80% lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than baseline methods, and demonstrated faster inference speeds by 2.3-4.1x.

Conclusion: The study showcases the feasibility and effectiveness of WM-MS3M for improving O-RAN control, allowing for more efficient, accurate, and scalable network management in 6G systems.

Abstract: We argue that sixth-generation (6G) intelligence is not fluent token
prediction but the capacity to imagine and choose -- to simulate future
scenarios, weigh trade-offs, and act with calibrated uncertainty. We reframe
open radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (Near-RT) control via
counterfactual dynamics and a world modeling (WM) paradigm that learns an
action-conditioned generative state space. This enables quantitative "what-if"
forecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling
primitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as
first-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis. An
agentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM)
planner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within
data-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples
multi-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic
latent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories
and predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic
O-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with
32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean
squared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster
inference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening.

*Pablo Rosillo-Rodes,Laurent Hébert-Dufresne,Peter Sheridan Dodds*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper develops a mathematical model to analyze the scaling behavior of type-token relationships in complex systems adhering to Zipf's law, providing a unified expression for different cases of power-law scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies and inaccuracy in the understanding of type-token relationships and their connection to Zipf's law across various scaling cases.

Method: An idealized, deterministic modeling approach is presented that avoids stochastic mechanisms and approximations, enabling exact computation of type-token relationships from rank-frequency scaling (Zipf's law).

Result: The authors derive a unified, asymptotic mathematical expression for type-token relationships for all values of the scaling exponent α, correcting issues with prior special cases like α = 1 and large α.

Conclusion: The study establishes that the general type-token relationship emerges as a direct mathematical consequence of Zipf's law, with no need for probabilistic elements.

Abstract: The growth dynamics of complex systems often exhibit statistical regularities
involving power-law relationships. For real finite complex systems formed by
countable tokens (animals, words) as instances of distinct types (species,
dictionary entries), an inverse power-law scaling $S \sim r^{-\alpha}$ between
type count $S$ and type rank $r$, widely known as Zipf's law, is widely
observed to varying degrees of fidelity. A secondary, summary relationship is
Heaps' law, which states that the number of types scales sublinearly with the
total number of observed tokens present in a growing system. Here, we propose
an idealized model of a growing system that (1) deterministically produces
arbitrary inverse power-law count rankings for types, and (2) allows us to
determine the exact asymptotics of the type-token relationship. Our argument
improves upon and remedies earlier work. We obtain a unified asymptotic
expression for all values of $\alpha$, which corrects the special cases of
$\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. Our approach relies solely on the form of
count rankings, avoids unnecessary approximations, and does not involve any
stochastic mechanisms or sampling processes. We thereby demonstrate that a
general type-token relationship arises solely as a consequence of Zipf's law.

*Vivi Andersson,Sofia Bobadilla,Harald Hobbelhagen,Martin Monperrus*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces POCO, an automated framework for generating proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits from vulnerability descriptions, aimed at improving smart contract security audits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart contracts are vulnerable to security flaws, and creating PoCs manually is time-intensive, error-prone, and difficult under strict schedules.

Method: The proposed POCO framework autonomously generates PoC exploits using a Reason-Act-Observe loop, combining interactive code-execution tools and integrating outputs directly into security reports.

Result: Evaluation on 23 real-world vulnerability reports confirmed POCO's superiority over baseline methods, generating higher-quality and logically accurate PoCs.

Conclusion: POCO reduces effort, increases efficiency in PoC generation, and supports actionable insights for enhancing smart contract security auditing processes.

Abstract: Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where
vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts
are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits
play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported
vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually
creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight
audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically
generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability
descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in
an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a
Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with
the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and
other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world
vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow
baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results
demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort
required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution
provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security
community.

### [299] [Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for LVLMs via Prior Knowledge-Calibrated Memory Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01952)
*Jinhua Yin,Peiru Yang,Chen Yang,Huili Wang,Zhiyang Hu,Shangguang Wang,Yongfeng Huang,Tao Qi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first black-box membership inference attack (MIA) framework for large vision-language models (LVLMs) to identify training data effectively, overcoming limitations of prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIA methods often assume access to internal features of LVLMs, causing applicability issues as mainstream LVLMs generally only expose outputs during inference.

Method: A black-box framework is proposed using a memory-probing mechanism calibrated by prior knowledge to assess the memorization of private semantic information unlikely deducible from general world knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs and datasets show the framework successfully identifies training data in black-box settings, with performance comparable to gray- and white-box methods.

Conclusion: The method is robust against adversarial manipulations and effectively addresses the challenges posed by black-box LVLMs, advancing MIA applicability.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) derive their capabilities from extensive
training on vast corpora of visual and textual data. Empowered by large-scale
parameters, these models often exhibit strong memorization of their training
data, rendering them susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs).
Existing MIA methods for LVLMs typically operate under white- or gray-box
assumptions, by extracting likelihood-based features for the suspected data
samples based on the target LVLMs. However, mainstream LVLMs generally only
expose generated outputs while concealing internal computational features
during inference, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we
propose the first black-box MIA framework for LVLMs, based on a prior
knowledge-calibrated memory probing mechanism. The core idea is to assess the
model memorization of the private semantic information embedded within the
suspected image data, which is unlikely to be inferred from general world
knowledge alone. We conducted extensive experiments across four LVLMs and three
datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively identifies
training data of LVLMs in a purely black-box setting and even achieves
performance comparable to gray-box and white-box methods. Further analysis
reveals the robustness of our method against potential adversarial
manipulations, and the effectiveness of the methodology designs. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/spmede/KCMP.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a watermarking method for discrete diffusion language models to differentiate AI-generated content from human creations and ensure reliable detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for watermarking techniques in discrete diffusion language models, which are becoming popular due to their high inference throughput, enabling improved tracking and differentiation of AI-generated content.

Method: The method involves applying the distribution-preserving Gumbel-max trick at every diffusion step and seeding randomness with the sequence index for reliable detection.

Result: The proposed watermarking scheme is proven to be reliably detectable on state-of-the-art diffusion language models while being distortion-free and achieving an exponentially decaying probability of false detection with increased token sequence length.

Conclusion: This work successfully introduces a novel, effective, and distortion-free watermarking method for discrete diffusion language models, contributing to the advancement of AI content tracking.

Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique to track AI-generated
content and differentiate it from authentic human creations. While prior work
extensively studies watermarking for autoregressive large language models
(LLMs) and image diffusion models, none address discrete diffusion language
models, which are becoming popular due to their high inference throughput. In
this paper, we introduce the first watermarking method for discrete diffusion
models by applying the distribution-preserving Gumbel-max trick at every
diffusion step and seeding the randomness with the sequence index to enable
reliable detection. We experimentally demonstrate that our scheme is reliably
detectable on state-of-the-art diffusion language models and analytically prove
that it is distortion-free with an exponentially decaying probability of false
detection in the token sequence length.

*Fuyi Wang,Zekai Chen,Mingyuan Fan,Jianying Zhou,Lei Pan,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces $sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic method for secure inference in graph neural networks, offering significant efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored challenge of securing GNNs and graph-structured data in privacy-critical cloud environments.

Method: It proposes $sysname$, leveraging hybrid additive and function secret sharing with secure two-party computation (2PC), introducing novel protocols for faster layer computations.

Result: The solution achieves up to 15x speedups in secure inference, confirmed by theoretical analysis and experiments across four datasets, while maintaining comparable accuracy to plaintext inference.

Conclusion: $sysname$ provides a practical and efficient secure inference protocol for GNNs, advancing privacy-preserving graph-centric computations in the cloud.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for analyzing and learning
from graph-structured (GS) data, facilitating a wide range of services.
Deploying such services in privacy-critical cloud environments necessitates the
development of secure inference (SI) protocols that safeguard sensitive GS
data. However, existing SI solutions largely focus on convolutional models for
image and text data, leaving the challenge of securing GNNs and GS data
relatively underexplored. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate
$\sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic scheme for graph-centric inference in
the cloud. By hybridizing additive and function secret sharings within secure
two-party computation (2PC), $\sysname$ is carefully designed based on a series
of novel 2PC interactive protocols that achieve $1.5\times \sim 1.7\times$
speedups for linear layers and $2\times \sim 15\times$ for non-linear layers
over state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions. A thorough theoretical analysis is
provided to prove $\sysname$'s correctness, security, and lightweight nature.
Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate $\sysname$'s superior
efficiency with $1.3\times \sim 4.7\times$ faster secure predictions while
maintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext graph property inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the risks posed by "LLM poisoning" during model training, particularly for security applications.

Method: The authors conducted experiments with fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models to showcase targeted poisoning attacks that bias the models to dismiss legitimate alerts.

Result: The study demonstrated significant bias in fine-tuned models, leading to the bypassing of critical prompts and compromised application of LLMs in security contexts.

Conclusion: LLM poisoning introduces significant risks, and the paper suggests mitigation strategies and best practices to improve trustworthiness and robustness in LLM applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates some of the risks introduced by "LLM poisoning," the
intentional or unintentional introduction of malicious or biased data during
model training. We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a
limited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple
LLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes
the introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we
demonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently
dismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we
propose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness,
robustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASTRA, an autonomous jailbreak framework improving attack strategies against Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving 82.7% Attack Success Rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security concerns in LLMs and design an effective jailbreak strategy capable of evading current defenses.

Method: Developed ASTRA, a framework employing continuous learning and modular principles, using a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" mechanism and tiered strategy library to autonomously evolve attack strategies.

Result: Through experiments in a black-box setting, ASTRA demonstrated an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: ASTRA successfully enhances jailbreak attacks with adaptability and extensibility, posing significant challenges for LLM security.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing
web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web
ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have
recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak
strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract
valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and
contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient
strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and
modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that
autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve
more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we
design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not
only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes
reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate
and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library
that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on
their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise
guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and
transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting,
and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR)
of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.

*Roy Rinberg,Adam Karvonen,Alex Hoover,Daniel Reuter,Keri Warr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the risk of model weight exfiltration from inference servers by proposing a verification framework to defend against such threats, formalizing the attack as a security game, and evaluating its effectiveness on large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the increasing vulnerability of valuable AI models to weight exfiltration attacks through inference servers, risking the misuse and unauthorized distribution of model assets.

Method: The authors formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification framework to detect steganographic exfiltration, and utilize practical estimators for valid sources of non-determinism to enable detection.

Result: The proposed detection framework reduces exfiltratable information to less than 0.5% on MOE-Qwen-30B with a false-positive rate of 0.01%, significantly slowing down adversaries by more than 200x.

Conclusion: Strong protection against model weight exfiltration can be achieved through the proposed approach without imposing significant additional costs to inference providers.

Abstract: As large AI models become increasingly valuable assets, the risk of model
weight exfiltration from inference servers grows accordingly. An attacker
controlling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them
within ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work
investigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and,
more broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We
formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification
framework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify
the trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we
characterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference
and introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection
framework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On
MOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to <0.5% with
false-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a >200x slowdown for
adversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending
against model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can
be achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces soft constraints to create symmetry-aware machine learning models, improving robustness and efficiency without enforcing exact symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of constructing machine learning models that respect physical symmetries and accommodate real-world deviations.

Method: The authors propose two methods using soft constraints: penalizing transformations of inputs and an approach inspired by group theory involving infinitesimal transformations.

Result: Applied to top quark jet tagging and Lorentz equivariance, the soft constraints enhanced robustness with minimal changes to current models.

Conclusion: Using soft constraints allows for flexibility in leveraging symmetries in machine learning, improving outcomes without rigid enforcement.

Abstract: Physical symmetries provide a strong inductive bias for constructing
functions to analyze data. In particular, this bias may improve robustness,
data efficiency, and interpretability of machine learning models. However,
building machine learning models that explicitly respect symmetries can be
difficult due to the dedicated components required. Moreover, real-world
experiments may not exactly respect fundamental symmetries at the level of
finite granularities and energy thresholds. In this work, we explore an
alternative approach to create symmetry-aware machine learning models. We
introduce soft constraints that allow the model to decide the importance of
added symmetries during the learning process instead of enforcing exact
symmetries. We investigate two complementary approaches, one that penalizes the
model based on specific transformations of the inputs and one inspired by group
theory and infinitesimal transformations of the inputs. Using top quark jet
tagging and Lorentz equivariance as examples, we observe that the addition of
the soft constraints leads to more robust performance while requiring
negligible changes to current state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving the Lasso method's selection stability in the presence of correlated predictors by introducing a weighting scheme to the penalty function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lasso is simple and performs well, but struggles with stability when predictors are correlated.

Method: The authors incorporate a weighting scheme based on correlation-adjusted ranking into the Lasso penalty function.

Result: The method shows better selection stability in both simulated and real-world datasets and proves effective for other regularization-based selection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed weighting scheme enhances selection stability for Lasso, offering potential as a general-purpose improvement for regularization methods.

Abstract: The Lasso has been widely used as a method for variable selection, valued for
its simplicity and empirical performance. However, Lasso's selection stability
deteriorates in the presence of correlated predictors. Several approaches have
been developed to mitigate this limitation. In this paper, we provide a brief
review of existing approaches, highlighting their limitations. We then propose
a simple technique to improve the selection stability of Lasso by integrating a
weighting scheme into the Lasso penalty function, where the weights are defined
as an increasing function of a correlation-adjusted ranking that reflects the
predictive power of predictors. Empirical evaluations on both simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. Additional
numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in
stabilizing other regularization-based selection methods, indicating its
potential as a general-purpose solution.

Motivation: To tackle challenges like high dimensionality, heterogeneous data sources, and data-sharing constraints in modern data environments, particularly in contexts like multi-institutional electronic health records.

Method: A distributed framework using a non-convex surrogate loss function optimized via bi-factored gradient descent is developed to enable scalable and privacy-preserving learning from large-scale binary data.

Result: The proposed algorithm was evaluated on electronic health record datasets from over 58,000 patients across two institutions, showing exceptional performance in tasks like relationship detection, patient phenotyping, and clustering.

Conclusion: The framework has significant potential for scalable statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional environments, effectively addressing data integration and privacy challenges.

Abstract: Classical probabilistic graphical models face fundamental challenges in
modern data environments, which are characterized by high dimensionality,
source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints. In this work, we
revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field

privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with
inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss
function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational
and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate
our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets
from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global
representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship
detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight
a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional
settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and
multi-institutional integration.

### [308] [High-Resolution Magnetic Particle Imaging System Matrix Recovery Using a Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02212)
*Abuobaida M. Khair,Wenjing Jiang,Yousuf Babiker M. Osman,Wenjun Xia,Xiaopeng Ma*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces VRF-Net, a hybrid deep learning framework for recovering high-resolution system matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) using transformer-based global attention and residual convolutional refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address degraded resolution in MPI caused by downsampling and coil sensitivity variations, improving the recovery of system matrices for enhanced imaging.

Method: VRF-Net employs a hybrid deep learning approach combining Vision Transformers and residual convolutional networks, trained on paired-image super-resolution datasets with simulated degradation conditions.

Result: VRF-Net demonstrated significant improvement in system matrix recovery and image reconstruction across multiple scales, achieving better quality metrics (nRMSE, pSNR, SSIM) compared to interpolation and CNN-based methods.

Conclusion: VRF-Net offers a promising avenue for high-quality system matrix recovery and image reconstruction in MPI, potentially advancing in vivo applications.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer
with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system
matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from
downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these
challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual
convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and
fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is
degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed
paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated
dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix
recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08
dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at
challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated
dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x
scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE
by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over
interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI
phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x
scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960),
outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables
sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction
across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prediction accuracy in alloy steel's mechanical properties for industrial benefits.

Method: A Random Forest Regression model was trained on material composition features and deformation percentage using performance metrics such as R2 scores and Mean Squared Errors.

Result: The model exhibited high predictive performance validated by metrics like R2 scores, MSE, residual plots, and learning curves.

Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn), Silicon (Si), Copper (Cu), Carbon
(C), and deformation percentage during cold rolling. Utilizing a dataset
comprising these features, we trained and evaluated the Random Forest model,

### [310] [Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01976)
*Yifan F. Zhang,Sarang Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proves that Gibbs states for certain Hamiltonians are resilient to weak local decoherence, enabling local reversal even in critical or ordered phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the resilience of classical and quantum thermal systems to weak decoherence in critical and ordered temperature phases.

Method: The authors utilize mathematical and physical proofs to establish the existence of local decoders capable of reversing local decoherence and analyze implications for thermally stable quantum memories.

Result: Decoherence effects are locally reversible below a critical threshold, with practical implications for quantum memories and denoising in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Thermally stable systems, even near critical points, exhibit resilience to decoherence, ensuring operational stability and implying computational efficiency in related models.

Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli,
Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the
effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our
conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered
low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal
correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits
critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local
"decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a
critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable
quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as
one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models,
stability of data distributions implies the existence of
computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.

*Ferhat Ozgur Catak,Jungwon Seo,Umit Cali*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes foundational principles for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning (TQML), focusing on uncertainty quantification, adversarial robustness, and privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address safety and reliability concerns in deploying Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in real-world applications, given its probabilistic nature, device noise in NISQ systems, and hybrid execution pipelines.

Method: The researchers formulated quantum-specific trust metrics based on quantum information theory, such as predictive uncertainty decomposition, robustness metrics using trace-distance, and differential privacy frameworks. The methods were validated on NISQ devices using parameterized quantum classifiers.

Result: Their experiments uncovered connections between uncertainty and prediction risk, differences in vulnerabilities to classical versus quantum perturbations, and privacy-utility trade-offs influenced by physical quantum system noise.

Conclusion: Building trustworthiness in Quantum AI should be a primary design goal, supported by quantifiable metrics for uncertainty, robustness, and privacy tailored specifically to quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling
computational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent
probabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and
hybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent
reliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This
research offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning
(TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliability: (i) uncertainty
quantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial
robustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii)
privacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios.
We formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information
theory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty,
trace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning
channels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a
unified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers,
uncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry
in attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and
privacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise. This
roadmap seeks to define trustworthiness as a first-class design objective for
quantum AI.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper introduces "spin-opstring" as a new data format derived from Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, showcasing its effectiveness as input for machine learning tasks in quantum many-body physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to represent and process quantum simulation data are limited in efficiency, transferability, and interpretability in machine learning applications.

Method: The authors leverage spin-opstring data as input for supervised machine learning models to identify phase transitions, predict non-local observables, handle transfer learning, and generalize across different system sizes.

Result: Spin-opstring improves prediction accuracy for quantum phase transitions compared to traditional spin configurations while succeeding in transfer learning and interpretability of physically meaningful features.

Conclusion: Spin-opstring is a compact, efficient, and interpretable input format for advancing ML applications in quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: We propose the use of the ``spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series
Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning (ML) input
data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation
cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the
state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised ML, we demonstrate
the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase
transitions, and in a regression task to predict non-local observables. We also
demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by
training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another,
as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well
to larger ones. Importantly, we illustrate a clear advantage of spin-opstring
over conventional spin configurations in the accurate prediction of a quantum
phase transition. Finally, we show how the inherent structure of spin-opstring
provides an elegant framework for the interpretability of ML predictions. Using
two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the ML models learn
and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these
findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable
input format for ML in quantum many-body physics.

### [313] [Before the Clinic: Transparent and Operable Design Principles for Healthcare AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01902)
*Alexander Bakumenko,Aaron J. Masino,Janine Hoelscher*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper highlights essential principles for bridging gaps in applying AI systems to healthcare, emphasizing Transparent Design and Operable Design to enhance pre-clinical preparation for successful clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between explainable AI theories, clinician expectations, and governance requirements to accelerate the effective clinical deployment of AI systems.

Method: Two key principles—Transparent Design and Operable Design—are proposed to guide pre-clinical technical requirements and align development efforts with clinician and governance needs.

Result: The principles are mapped to clinician requirements and governance frameworks, aiming for practical, actionable guidance and harmonization among stakeholders, fostering smoother clinical AI transitions.

Conclusion: Clear pre-clinical design principles help align clinician, researcher, and governance perspectives, reducing barriers for healthcare AI systems and improving their path to clinical practice.

Abstract: The translation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems into clinical
practice requires bridging fundamental gaps between explainable AI theory,
clinician expectations, and governance requirements. While conceptual
frameworks define what constitutes explainable AI (XAI) and qualitative studies
identify clinician needs, little practical guidance exists for development
teams to prepare AI systems prior to clinical evaluation. We propose two
foundational design principles, Transparent Design and Operable Design, that
operationalize pre-clinical technical requirements for healthcare AI.
Transparent Design encompasses interpretability and understandability artifacts
that enable case-level reasoning and system traceability. Operable Design
encompasses calibration, uncertainty, and robustness to ensure reliable,
predictable system behavior under real-world conditions. We ground these
principles in established XAI frameworks, map them to documented clinician
needs, and demonstrate their alignment with emerging governance requirements.
This pre-clinical playbook provides actionable guidance for development teams,
accelerates the path to clinical evaluation, and establishes a shared
vocabulary bridging AI researchers, healthcare practitioners, and regulatory
stakeholders. By explicitly scoping what can be built and verified before
clinical deployment, we aim to reduce friction in clinical AI translation while
remaining cautious about what constitutes validated, deployed explainability.

*Noa Izsak*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper explores the redesign of reinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course using a large language model (LLM) to identify student learning challenges and improve pedagogical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of poorly defined reinforcement roles in demanding courses by improving their structure, oversight, and integration with core teaching using an LLM.

Method: The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a second-year student to anticipate learning difficulties and inform the design of reinforcement sessions.

Result: The intervention improved student confidence, reduced anxiety, and clarified complex topics such as the pumping lemma and formal language expressive power comparisons.

Conclusion: Reflective, instructor-facing use of LLMs has proven effective in enhancing pedagogical design in dense theoretical domains and shows promise for adaptation to other challenging courses.

Abstract: In the aftermath of COVID-19, many universities implemented supplementary
"reinforcement" roles to support students in demanding courses. Although the
name for such roles may differ between institutions, the underlying idea of
providing structured supplementary support is common. However, these roles were
often poorly defined, lacking structured materials, pedagogical oversight, and
integration with the core teaching team. This paper reports on the redesign of
reinforcement sessions in a challenging undergraduate course on formal methods
and computational models, using a large language model (LLM) as a reflective
planning tool. The LLM was prompted to simulate the perspective of a
second-year student, enabling the identification of conceptual bottlenecks,
gaps in intuition, and likely reasoning breakdowns before classroom delivery.
These insights informed a structured, repeatable session format combining
targeted review, collaborative examples, independent student work, and guided
walkthroughs. Conducted over a single semester, the intervention received
positive student feedback, indicating increased confidence, reduced anxiety,
and improved clarity, particularly in abstract topics such as the pumping lemma
and formal language expressive power comparisons. The findings suggest that
reflective, instructor-facing use of LLMs can enhance pedagogical design in
theoretically dense domains and may be adaptable to other cognitively demanding
computer science courses.

*Ameemah Humayun,Bushra Zubair,Maryam Mustafa*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores how large language models (LLMs) can address maternal health crises in low-resource settings, specifically Pakistan, by analyzing communication patterns and evaluating LLMs' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maternal deaths in low-resource countries, particularly in Pakistan, remain at alarming levels, even though many are preventable. This study aims to harness LLMs to enhance health communication and risk assessment in these conservative contexts.

Method: The research involves a two-stage process: (1) analyzing data from clinical observations, interviews, and focus groups with clinicians and patients in Pakistan, and (2) evaluating the performance of five popular LLMs on the analyzed data.

Result: The study identifies two axes of communication (referential domain and expression approach), and reveals significant challenges in LLM interpretive performance, including semantic drift, myths, and polysemy in communications.

Conclusion: LLMs face challenges in understanding indirect communication in conservative contexts. The paper contributes empirical insights into SRH communication, a framework for categorizing indirect communication, LLM performance evaluations, and design recommendations for improving SRH interventions.

Abstract: Low-resource countries represent over 90% of maternal deaths, with Pakistan
among the top four countries contributing nearly half in 2023. Since these
deaths are mostly preventable, large language models (LLMs) can help address
this crisis by automating health communication and risk assessment. However,
sexual and reproductive health (SRH) communication in conservative contexts
often relies on indirect language that obscures meaning, complicating LLM-based
interventions. We conduct a two-stage study in Pakistan: (1) analyzing data
from clinical observations, interviews, and focus groups with clinicians and
patients, and (2) evaluating the interpretive capabilities of five popular LLMs
on this data. Our analysis identifies two axes of communication (referential
domain and expression approach) and shows LLMs struggle with semantic drift,
myths, and polysemy in clinical interactions. We contribute: (1) empirical
themes in SRH communication, (2) a categorization framework for indirect
communication, (3) evaluation of LLM performance, and (4) design
recommendations for culturally-situated SRH communication.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of Generative AI and LLMs on human intellectual labor and education, proposing constructivist strategies to preserve human intelligence advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advancements and adoption of Generative AI, such as LLMs and ChatGPT, are reshaping intellectual work, raising concerns about the future role of uniquely human skills.

Method: The authors identify limitations of current AI systems, analyze their fundamental weaknesses, and propose constructivist approaches for education to address the challenges posed by pervasive AI.

Result: The study highlights essential weaknesses in AI systems rooted in LLM technology, which limit their ability to fully replace human intellectual capacities.

Conclusion: Educational strategies must evolve to focus on cultivating human intelligence and skills that remain relevant, leveraging constructivist approaches to maintain a competitive edge over AI.

Abstract: The debate over whether "thinking machines" could replace human intellectual
labor has existed in both public and expert discussions since the mid-twentieth
century, when the concept and terminology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) first
emerged. For decades, this idea remained largely theoretical. However, with the
recent advent of Generative AI - particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) -
and the widespread adoption of tools such as ChatGPT, the issue has become a
practical reality. Many fields that rely on human intellectual effort are now
being reshaped by AI tools that both expand human capabilities and challenge
the necessity of certain forms of work once deemed uniquely human but now
easily automated. Education, somewhat unexpectedly, faces a pivotal
responsibility: to devise long-term strategies for cultivating human skills
that will remain relevant in an era of pervasive AI in the intellectual domain.
In this context, we identify the limitations of current AI systems - especially
those rooted in LLM technology - argue that the fundamental causes of these
weaknesses cannot be resolved through existing methods, and propose directions
within the constructivist paradigm for transforming education to preserve the
long-term advantages of human intelligence over AI tools.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI User Share, a metric derived from Microsoft telemetry data, to measure global AI tool usage across 147 economies despite limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of population-normalized, cross-country data to measure global AI diffusion effectively.

Method: The authors developed a novel metric, AI User Share, using anonymized Microsoft telemetry data adjusted for device access and mobile scaling, covering 147 economies.

Result: Findings show significant global variation in AI adoption, with high usage in developed economies and latent demand in lower-income countries.

Conclusion: AI User Share provides valuable insights for tracking global AI diffusion and informing AI policy, despite potential biases from Microsoft-sourced data.

Abstract: Measuring global AI diffusion remains challenging due to a lack of
population-normalized, cross-country usage data. We introduce AI User Share, a
novel indicator that estimates the share of each country's working-age
population actively using AI tools. Built from anonymized Microsoft telemetry
and adjusted for device access and mobile scaling, this metric spans 147
economies and provides consistent, real-time insight into global AI diffusion.
We find wide variation in adoption, with a strong correlation between AI User
Share and GDP. High uptake is concentrated in developed economies, though usage
among internet-connected populations in lower-income countries reveals
substantial latent demand. We also detect sharp increases in usage following
major product launches, such as DeepSeek in early 2025. While the metric's
reliance solely on Microsoft telemetry introduces potential biases related to
this user base, it offers an important new lens into how AI is spreading
globally. AI User Share enables timely benchmarking that can inform data-driven
AI policy.

*Jiawei Liu,Enis Berk Çoban,Zarina Schevchenko,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu,Michael I Mandel,Johanna Devaney*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interleaved instruction tuning approach for audio multi-modal models (MLLMs) using a new reasoning benchmark (SHARD) and observes enhanced performance on reasoning tasks with fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen the integration of modalities (like audio and text) in MLLMs and improve their reasoning capability leveraging the core language model.

Method: Interleaved instruction tuning where audio tokens are incorporated within the text prompt; evaluated using the LTU model and SHARD dataset.

Result: Interleaved prompting improves reasoning tasks performance, with further gains through fine-tuning, albeit reducing the MLLM's audio labeling capability.

Conclusion: Interleaved instruction tuning can enhance reasoning performance in audio MLLMs, but may negatively impact other audio-specific tasks.

Abstract: Standard training for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) involves
concatenating non-textual information, like vision or audio, with a text
prompt. This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities,
limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning
capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning
in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using
the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an
experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our
newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing
on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even
zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a
small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the
results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.

TL;DR: Proposes WVSC-D framework for semantic-level video compression in wireless communication, improving bandwidth efficiency and video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wireless video transmission focuses on pixel-level coding, neglecting semantic information in videos.

Method: Introduced WVSC-D, which uses semantic-level encoding and a reference semantic frame, alongside a DDMFC approach for frame compensation.

Result: Experimental results show WVSC-D outperforms existing methods (e.g., DVSC), achieving 1.8 dB gains in PSNR.

Conclusion: By combining semantic encoding and advanced frame compensation methods, WVSC-D increases bandwidth efficiency while maintaining high video quality.

Abstract: Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in
pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this
paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with
decoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D,
which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video
transmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic
frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations,
enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover,
to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is
introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding
methods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current
semantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the
reference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth
efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance.
Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based
methods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.

TL;DR: This paper presents advanced first-order algorithms in the Frank-Wolfe family for optimizing smooth convex functions over compact convex sets while addressing challenges of solution sparsity and dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate first-order optimization algorithms, specifically for smooth convex functions over complex constraint classes, while addressing the issues of solution sparsity and dependency on high dimensions.

Method: The paper proposes two algorithms: (1) a linear optimization oracle method for polytopes with optimal worst-case oracle complexity scaling based on solution sparsity and (2) a hybrid method combining Frank-Wolfe and sparse projections for matrix domains, which achieves efficient complexity independent of dimensions.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve optimal first-order oracle complexity and significantly reduce computational dependency on ambient dimensions and rank sparsity. They're particularly effective after a finite burn-in phase.

Conclusion: The methods successfully improve Frank-Wolfe algorithms for convex optimization, offering notable acceleration without additional complexity overheads from high dimensional spaces.

Abstract: We develop new accelerated first-order algorithms in the Frank-Wolfe (FW)
family for minimizing smooth convex functions over compact convex sets, with a
focus on two prominent constraint classes: (1) polytopes and (2) matrix domains
given by the spectrahedron and the unit nuclear-norm ball. A key technical
ingredient is a complementarity condition that captures solution sparsity --
face dimension for polytopes and rank for matrices. We present two algorithms:
(1) a purely linear optimization oracle (LOO) method for polytopes that has
optimal worst-case first-order (FO) oracle complexity and, aside of a finite
\emph{burn-in} phase and up to a logarithmic factor, has LOO complexity that
scales with $r/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy and
$r$ is the solution sparsity $r$ (independently of the ambient dimension), and
(2) a hybrid scheme that combines FW with a sparse projection oracle (e.g.,
low-rank SVDs for matrix domains with low-rank solutions), which also has
optimal FO oracle complexity, and after a finite burn-in phase, only requires
$O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ sparse projections and LOO calls (independently of both
the ambient dimension and the rank of optimal solutions). Our results close a
gap on how to accelerate recent advancements in linearly-converging FW
algorithms for strongly convex optimization, without paying the price of the
dimension.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces LGCC, an enhanced framework for image editing that resolves issues in existing MLLMs like BAGEL, improving detail, consistency, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-matching MLLMs like BAGEL have limitations such as degraded detail, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to random noise initialization.

Method: The approach involves Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) to maintain spatial detail, Content Consistency Loss (CCL) to ensure semantic alignment, and curriculum learning to integrate LGCC into BAGEL.

Result: LGCC reduces inference steps and achieves significant improvements in local detail scores (1.60%) and overall scores (0.53%) while speeding up editing processes 2x-5x compared to BAGEL or Flux.

Conclusion: LGCC provides a cost-efficient solution that enhances editing quality by preserving details, maintaining content integrity, and improving inference speed.

Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the great potential of flow
matching-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image editing.
However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail
degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on
random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel
framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and
Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling
target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled
pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image
modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with
the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce
inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall
scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x
for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL
or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain
contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient
solution without compromising editing quality.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of verifying learning-enabled cyber-physical systems, which are hindered by black-box components and demanding real-world environments.

Method: ScenicProver employs compositional system descriptions, contracts using extended Linear Temporal Logic, evidence generation through testing, formal proofs, assumptions import, and assurance case generation.

Result: The framework demonstrates stronger probabilistic guarantees in an autonomous vehicle case study, optimizing testing efforts and leveraging sensor guarantees.

Conclusion: ScenicProver provides a general framework for compositional verification, offering improved reliability and assurance in learning-enabled CPS over traditional monolithic testing approaches.

Abstract: Full verification of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) has long
been intractable due to challenges including black-box components and complex
real-world environments. Existing tools either provide formal guarantees for
limited types of systems or test the system as a monolith, but no general
framework exists for compositional analysis of learning-enabled CPS using
varied verification techniques over complex real-world environments. This paper
introduces ScenicProver, a verification framework that aims to fill this gap.
Built upon the Scenic probabilistic programming language, the framework
supports: (1) compositional system description with clear component interfaces,
ranging from interpretable code to black boxes; (2) assume-guarantee contracts
over those components using an extension of Linear Temporal Logic containing
arbitrary Scenic expressions; (3) evidence generation through testing, formal
proofs via Lean 4 integration, and importing external assumptions; (4)
systematic combination of generated evidence using contract operators; and (5)
automatic generation of assurance cases tracking the provenance of system-level
guarantees. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study
on an autonomous vehicle's automatic emergency braking system with sensor
fusion. By leveraging manufacturer guarantees for radar and laser sensors and
focusing testing efforts on uncertain conditions, our approach enables stronger
probabilistic guarantees than monolithic testing with the same computational
budget.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: This paper extends previous work using nominal techniques for data types with variable binding to mixed binding signatures for creating mixed inductive-coinductive terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a nominal description for abc-infinitary lambda-terms and capture-avoiding substitution on alpha-equivalence classes.

Method: The authors introduce mixed binding signatures and extend nominal techniques to handle mixed inductive-coinductive terms.

Result: A nominal framework for handling abc-infinitary lambda-terms and substitution on alpha-equivalence classes is successfully implemented.

Conclusion: Nominal techniques are shown to effectively extend to mixed binding scenarios, allowing detailed mathematical treatment of infinitary terms.

Abstract: Ten years ago, it was shown that nominal techniques can be used to design
coalgebraic data types with variable binding, so that alpha-equivalence classes
of infinitary terms are directly endowed with a corecursion principle. We
introduce "mixed" binding signatures, as well as the corresponding type of
mixed inductive-coinductive terms. We extend the aforementioned work to this
setting. In particular, this allows for a nominal description of the sets
Lambda_abc of abc-infinitary lambda-terms (for a, b, c in {0,1}) and of
capture-avoiding substitution on alpha-equivalence classes of such terms.

### [324] [Learning CNF formulas from uniform random solutions in the local lemma regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02487)
*Weiming Feng,Xiongxin Yang,Yixiao Yu,Yiyao Zhang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper explores learning $k$-CNF formulas (hard Boolean MRFs) from uniform random solutions. It improves sample complexity bounds and establishes new lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the problem of efficiently learning $k$-CNF formulas from limited samples, improving over previous sample complexity results.

Method: The authors revisit and extend Valiant's algorithm, demonstrating its application on $k$-CNFs with bounded clause intersections and random $k$-CNFs near the satisfiability threshold. They also derive new information-theoretic lower bounds.

Result: Key results include significantly reduced sample complexities: $O(\log n)$ for certain $k$-CNFs and $\widetilde{O}(n^{\exp(-\sqrt{k})})$ for random $k$-CNFs, compared to prior $O(n^k)$.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical understanding of learning $k$-CNFs and hard Boolean MRFs, providing practical insights for efficiency and new lower bounds for sample complexities.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a $n$-variables $k$-CNF formula $\Phi$ from
its i.i.d. uniform random solutions, which is equivalent to learning a Boolean
Markov random field (MRF) with $k$-wise hard constraints. Revisiting Valiant's
algorithm (Commun. ACM'84), we show that it can exactly learn (1) $k$-CNFs with
bounded clause intersection size under Lov\'asz local lemma type conditions,
from $O(\log n)$ samples; and (2) random $k$-CNFs near the satisfiability
threshold, from $\widetilde{O}(n^{\exp(-\sqrt{k})})$ samples. These results
significantly improve the previous $O(n^k)$ sample complexity. We further
establish new information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity for both
exact and approximate learning from i.i.d. uniform random solutions.

TL;DR: The paper investigates non-monotone DR-submodular maximization problems under size constraints, proposing two new algorithms (FastDrSub and FastDrSub++) with significant theoretical and experimental performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of non-monotone DR-submodular maximization with size constraints effectively and efficiently, as current methods lack both satisfactory approximation guarantees and low computational complexity.

Method: The paper introduces two algorithms: FastDrSub with a $0.044$ approximation ratio and $O(n \log(k))$ complexity, and FastDrSub++ with an improved $1/4-\epsilon$ approximation ratio and same complexity. They are the first constant-ratio approximation algorithms with this low query complexity.

Result: Both algorithms deliver superior performance compared to existing approaches, with experimental results showing improved query complexity and solution quality for the Revenue Maximization problem.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms, FastDrSub and FastDrSub++, provide constant-ratio approximations with low computational complexity, marking a significant advance in solving constrained DR-submodular maximization problems.

Abstract: This work studies the non-monotone DR-submodular Maximization over a ground
set of $n$ subject to a size constraint $k$. We propose two approximation
algorithms for solving this problem named FastDrSub and FastDrSub++. FastDrSub
offers an approximation ratio of $0.044$ with query complexity of $O(n
\log(k))$. The second one, FastDrSub++, improves upon it with a ratio of
$1/4-\epsilon$ within query complexity of $(n \log k)$ for an input parameter
$\epsilon >0$. Therefore, our proposed algorithms are the first constant-ratio
approximation algorithms for the problem with the low complexity of $O(n
\log(k))$.
  Additionally, both algorithms are experimentally evaluated and compared
against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in
solving the Revenue Maximization problem with DR-submodular objective function.
The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms significantly
outperform existing approaches in terms of both query complexity and solution
quality.

### [326] [Many-vs-Many Missile Guidance via Virtual Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02526)
*Marc Schneider,Walter Fichter*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new many-vs-many missile guidance strategy using probabilistic virtual targets (VTs) based on trajectory prediction. It outperforms conventional methods, especially when there are more interceptors than targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved missile guidance strategies in many-vs-many scenarios, specifically exploiting numerical superiority and addressing the challenge of unpredictable target behavior.

Method: A Normalizing Flows-based model generates probabilistic virtual target trajectories. Interceptors use Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse and Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal interception in a centralized strategy.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show that the VT method performs equally or better than straight-line predictions, with significant improvements (5.8-14.4%) when the number of interceptors exceeds the number of targets.

Conclusion: The probabilistic VT-based approach effectively enhances interception probabilities in many-vs-many missile guidance by leveraging numerical advantages and focusing on distribution-based trajectories.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to many-vs-many missile guidance using
virtual targets (VTs) generated by a Normalizing Flows-based trajectory
predictor. Rather than assigning n interceptors directly to m physical targets
through conventional weapon target assignment algorithms, we propose a
centralized strategy that constructs n VT trajectories representing
probabilistic predictions of maneuvering target behavior. Each interceptor is
guided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse
flight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal
interception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as
many-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by
distributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than
pursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across
various target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)
demonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line
prediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to
5.8-14.4% when n > m. The results confirm that probabilistic VTs enable
effective exploitation of numerical superiority, significantly increasing
interception probability in many-vs-many scenarios.

### [327] [Enhancing Phenotype Discovery in Electronic Health Records through Prior Knowledge-Guided Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02102)
*Melanie Mayer,Kimberly Lactaoen,Gary E. Weissman,Blanca E. Himes,Rebecca A. Hubbard*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian latent class framework for phenotyping in electronic health records (EHR) by incorporating domain-specific knowledge to improve interpretability, illustrated through asthma sub-phenotype detection informed by Type 2 inflammation features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of improving clinical interpretability in unsupervised learning for phenotype discovery using EHR data by integrating domain-specific knowledge, focusing on asthma sub-phenotypes associated with Type 2 inflammation.

Method: They developed a Bayesian latent class model incorporating clinically informed priors to guide clustering towards meaningful subgroups, accounting for data missing patterns and permitting patient-specific phenotype assignment probabilities with uncertainty.

Result: The analysis of over 44,000 adult asthma patients revealed a distinctive sub-phenotype of 'uncontrolled T2-high' asthma characterized by elevated eosinophil counts, allergy markers, and high healthcare utilization, showcasing the model's efficacy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of Bayesian modeling for hypothesis generation and cohort identification in heterogeneous diseases, emphasizing interpretability and the integration of clinical knowledge for EHR-based phenotyping.

Abstract: Objectives: Unsupervised learning with electronic health record (EHR) data
has shown promise for phenotype discovery, but approaches typically disregard
existing clinical information, limiting interpretability. We operationalize a
Bayesian latent class framework for phenotyping that incorporates
domain-specific knowledge to improve clinical meaningfulness of EHR-derived
phenotypes and illustrate its utility by identifying an asthma sub-phenotype
informed by features of Type 2 (T2) inflammation.
  Materials and methods: We illustrate a framework for incorporating clinical
knowledge into a Bayesian latent class model via informative priors to guide
unsupervised clustering toward clinically relevant subgroups. This approach
models missingness, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns,
and provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment with
uncertainty. Using reusable and flexible code, we applied the model to a large
asthma EHR cohort, specifying informative priors for T2 inflammation-related
features and weakly informative priors for other clinical variables, allowing
the data to inform posterior distributions.
  Results and Conclusion: Using encounter data from January 2017 to February
2024 for 44,642 adult asthma patients, we found a bimodal posterior
distribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear class separation. The T2
inflammation-informed class (38.7%) was characterized by elevated eosinophil
levels and allergy markers, plus high healthcare utilization and medication
use, despite weakly informative priors on the latter variables. These patterns
suggest an "uncontrolled T2-high" sub-phenotype. This demonstrates how our
Bayesian latent class modeling approach supports hypothesis generation and
cohort identification in EHR-based studies of heterogeneous diseases without
well-established phenotype definitions.

### [328] [DiffPace: Diffusion-based Plug-and-play Augmented Channel Estimation in mmWave and Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01867)
*Zhengdong Hu,Chong Han,Wolfgang Gerstacker,Robert Schober*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents DiffPace, a novel diffusion-based approach to enhance channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems, achieving high precision (-15 dB NMSE at 10 dB SNR) and efficiency (90% fewer inference steps).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems caused by high channel dimensionality, compressed observations, and hybrid near- and far-field radiation patterns.

Method: The authors propose DiffPace, a diffusion-based plug-and-play method that leverages a diffusion model to represent the channel distribution under the hybrid spherical-planar model. It reduces inference steps by solving an ordinary differential equation.

Result: DiffPace achieves -15 dB NMSE at 10 dB SNR with 90% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art methods, improving estimation precision and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DiffPace enhances CE in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems by effectively capturing complex channel structures, offering both high accuracy and computational efficiency, thus supporting next-generation wireless communication needs.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great
promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless
networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss
inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive
multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming
architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral
efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO
systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed
observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and
far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high
carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing
based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot
faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures,
leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a
diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a
diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid
spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach,
it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM
performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the
number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method.
Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance,
attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art
schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced
computational efficiency.

*Marios Impraimakis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using Kullback-Leibler divergence within the Kalman filter framework to choose the most plausible system estimation from varying initial parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty caused by differing results due to varying initial parameter guesses in system state estimations.

Method: Implementing the Kalman filter on various initial parameter sets and using Kullback-Leibler divergence to compare posterior distributions with prior distributions.

Result: The method effectively selects better-performing estimations across different scenarios, including linear, nonlinear, and limited information systems.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the reliability of system monitoring and parameter-state estimation by mitigating uncertainties stemming from initial parameter selection.

Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined
herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state
estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification
suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from
different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the
information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior
distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for
a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system
input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior
distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions
using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the
least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most
plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better
performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information
applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.

*Marios Impraimakis,Andrew W. Smyth*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The study examines a novel unscented Kalman filter's capability to estimate system states, parameters, and unknown inputs simultaneously in real-time using a new two-stage method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the accuracy and real-time capability of state, parameter, and input estimation methodologies for both linear and nonlinear systems.

Method: The proposed method uses a two-stage unscented Kalman filter approach to estimate unknown inputs by first using predicted states and parameters and then refining estimates with corrected measurements.

Result: The approach demonstrates, via perturbation analysis, the potential for unique identification of systems with known or partially known inputs, enhancing understanding over traditional parameter-only methods.

Conclusion: Joint estimation of states, parameters, and inputs in real-time provides a more comprehensive understanding of system behavior than traditional output-only identification techniques.

Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman
filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown
input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted
dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input.
Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final
estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis
that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially
be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better
understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter
identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters,
and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited access to multi-channel EEG in many regions globally, necessitating affordable alternative solutions for epilepsy care.

Method: An open dataset of single-channel EEG was created (NEUROSKY-EPI), accompanied by EmbedCluster, a pipeline transferring representations from pre-trained EEGNet models and combining them with contextual autoencoder embeddings for clustering patients.

Result: Low-cost, single-channel EEG data demonstrated the ability to support meaningful patient stratification while considering deployability, interpretability, and ethical concerns.

Conclusion: Providing affordable tools and open datasets can foster interdisciplinary research to revolutionize epilepsy care, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Access to clinical multi-channel EEG remains limited in many regions
worldwide. We present NEUROSKY-EPI, the first open dataset of single-channel,
consumer-grade EEG for epilepsy, collected in a South Asian clinical setting
along with rich contextual metadata. To explore its utility, we introduce
EmbedCluster, a patient-stratification pipeline that transfers representations
from EEGNet models trained on clinical data and enriches them with contextual
autoencoder embeddings, followed by unsupervised clustering of patients based
on EEG patterns. Results show that low-cost, single-channel data can support
meaningful stratification. Beyond algorithmic performance, we emphasize
human-centered concerns such as deployability in resource-constrained
environments, interpretability for non-specialists, and safeguards for privacy,
inclusivity, and bias. By releasing the dataset and code, we aim to catalyze
interdisciplinary research across health technology, human-computer
interaction, and machine learning, advancing the goal of affordable and
actionable EEG-based epilepsy care.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in RF-based 3D object reconstruction using a novel framework leveraging Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and a Detection Transformer (DETR). It achieves an accuracy of 79.35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional optical methods face limitations under occlusion or poor lighting conditions, highlighting the need for alternative sensing technologies like RF, which can penetrate materials and capture object geometry and composition.

Method: The paper introduces a framework utilizing Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) to manipulate RF propagation through RIS. A Detection Transformer (DETR) is employed to infer spatial and material properties from RF features.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates the ability to reconstruct 3D object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, based on simulation results.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising approach to RF-based object reconstruction by integrating RIS and DETR. It shows potential for advancing physically grounded 3D visualization in RF sensing.

Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has
intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the
limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion
or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose
electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and
compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts
reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments
(PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of
propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby
providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability,
this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object
reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach
combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that
infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features.
Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object
geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of
79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded
RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in radar sensing performance under unknown and dynamic disturbance characteristics in ISAC systems, promoting robust and spectrum-efficient wireless networks.

Method: The framework employs RL (SARSA-based algorithm) for adaptive target position estimation, integrates Wald-type detectors for non-Gaussian clutter, and formulates a joint waveform optimization strategy for balancing radar and communication performance.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show improved detection probability and competitive communication throughput against baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced system capabilities.

Conclusion: RL-assisted cognitive frameworks in ISAC systems significantly enhance sensing and communication efficiency, aiding next-generation wireless advancement.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework
for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems
employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing
performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance
characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection
under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive
estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on
the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is
formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication
throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between
detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived
closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed
cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability
compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining
competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of
RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation
wireless networks.

*Mark Blümel,Andreas C. Schneider,Valentin Neuhaus,David A. Ehrlich,Marcel Graetz,Michael Wibral,Abdullah Makkeh,Viola Priesemann*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper uses Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to analyze and improve the memory capacity of Hopfield networks, achieving a tenfold increase in performance by optimizing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current associative memory models like Hopfield networks possess limited memory capacity, and the local computational principles enabling associative retrieval remain poorly understood. The authors aim to better characterize local information processing and improve network performance using an information-theoretic framework.

Method: The authors apply Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to analyze neurons in Hopfield networks, focusing on information decomposition (unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions). Inspired by findings on redundancy, they optimize neural redundancy as a learning goal to increase memory capacity.

Result: By maximizing redundancy, the memory capacity of the network is increased to 1.59, more than tenfold greater than the classical Hopfield networks’ capacity of 0.14 and surpassing recent state-of-the-art implementations.

Conclusion: Redundancy maximization is proposed as a novel, effective design principle for associative memories, offering a foundation for better-performing models based on information-theoretic objectives.

Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the
retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the
local computational principles which are required to enable this function
remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information
processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory
- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of
different inputs to an output into unique information from each input,
redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges
from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons
in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the
information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between
the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and
unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and
performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as
an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each
neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more
than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks
and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield
networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new
design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new
associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.

TL;DR: The paper addresses high computational costs of neural receivers by introducing optimization strategies including quantization and compression techniques to improve hardware efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying neural receivers on hardware-constrained devices faces challenges due to their high network complexity and computational cost.

Method: The paper explores uniform and non-uniform quantization methods, proposes a fine-grained adjustment to Incremental Network Quantization, and introduces two novel lossless compression algorithms for redundancy reduction.

Result: Quantization saves 45% power and 44% area in multipliers, while combined quantization and compression reduce memory footprint by 63.4%, maintaining superior performance over conventional receivers.

Conclusion: The proposed quantization and compression strategies significantly enhance hardware efficiency for neural receivers while retaining excellent performance.

Abstract: Neural receivers have shown outstanding performance compared to the
conventional ones but this comes with a high network complexity leading to a
heavy computational cost. This poses significant challenges in their deployment
on hardware-constrained devices. To address the issue, this paper explores two
optimization strategies: quantization and compression. We introduce both
uniform and non-uniform quantization such as the Fibonacci Code word
Quantization (FCQ). A novel fine-grained approach to the Incremental Network
Quantization (INQ) strategy is then proposed to compensate for the losses
introduced by the above mentioned quantization techniques. Additionally, we
introduce two novel lossless compression algorithms that effectively reduce the
memory size by compressing sequences of Fibonacci quantized parameters
characterized by a huge redundancy. The quantization technique provides a
saving of 45\% and 44\% in the multiplier's power and area, respectively, and
its combination with the compression determines a 63.4\% reduction in memory
footprint, while still providing higher performances than a conventional
receiver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-gen wireless systems need ultra-reliable low-latency (URLLC) communication for critical applications, and two-hop communication presents challenges in meeting these requirements.

Method: The authors use a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware transmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to configure hop-specific transmission parameters adaptively, modeled as a Markov decision process.

Result: Simulation results show that DRL-CoLA achieves near-optimal reliability while adhering to strict latency constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-CoLA method is effective and achieves both reliability and low latency, addressing the challenges in URLLC transmission for two-hop systems.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless communication systems must support ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC) service for mission-critical applications.
Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop
cooperative communication. In this paper, we develop an adaptive transmission
design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission
adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including
numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable
packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the
hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and
propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware
transmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to learn latency-aware transmission policies
in a distributed manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm
achieves the near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency
requirements.

Motivation: Existing causal inference methods relying on directed acyclic graphs fail to consider feedback loops prevalent in biological systems, necessitating a novel framework for accurate network inference.

Method: A framework named SCALD is developed using a nonlinear structural equation model with stable feedback loop constraints and continuous optimization to infer causal biological networks.

Result: SCALD achieved superior performance in identifying transcriptional regulatory and signaling transduction networks, confirmed novel regulatory relationships and highlighted its importance in feedback regulation.

Conclusion: SCALD demonstrates advanced capabilities in inferring regulatory feedback loops, validating with experimental data, and aiding in understanding disease-related genetic drivers, offering a transformative tool for biological research.

Abstract: Biological networks are pivotal in deciphering the complexity and
functionality of biological systems. Causal inference, which focuses on
determining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables
rather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach
for inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure
inference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be
represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at
odds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems,
making these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference.
In this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model
for Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a
stable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to
infer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that
SCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional
regulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has
irreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through
transcription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the
accuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the
discovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have
subsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by
utilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the
transformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic
changes within regulatory networks during the process.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the efficiency, robustness, and speed of Bayesian inference workflows specifically for pulsar timing array data analysis.

Method: Integrating the i-nessai sampler into the Enterprise framework, benchmarking its performance on simulated datasets, and analyzing computational scaling and stability.

Result: The approach achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence estimates with reduced runtime, up to 1000x faster compared to conventional MCMC analyses.

Conclusion: Flow-based nested sampling can significantly accelerate pulsar timing array analyses without compromising inference quality.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing
array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through
the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise
framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on
realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and
stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence
estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of
magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional
single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the
potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while
preserving the quality of the inference.

### [339] [Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01959)
*Eleonora Villa,Luigi D'Amico,Aldo Barca,Fatima Modica Bittordo,Francesco Alì,Massimo Meneghetti,Luca Naso*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy with orthogonal reparametrization to improve noise parameter estimation in Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in the standard PTA noise modeling approach, which uses fixed uniform noise priors, possibly leading to systematic biases.

Method: The authors integrate hierarchical Bayesian modeling with hyperparameter-driven noise priors and employ orthogonal reparametrization using Normalizing Flows, coupled with i-nessai for efficient sampling.

Result: Their methodology, applied to a 3-pulsar case study, showed improved constraints on noise parameters, reduced red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, and enhanced parameter independence.

Conclusion: This innovative approach enhances robustness in PTA analyses, offering tighter noise parameter constraints and alleviating parameter degeneracies associated with gravitational wave measurements.

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency
gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged
by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA
analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can
introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this
limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise
priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the
challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise
parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure
variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal
reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows.
We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore
the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a
minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and
SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show
that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly
and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal
reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the
correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes
involved.

*Obada Kraishan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how emoji reactions influence emotional contagion in software development discussions on GitHub, revealing significant positive impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role emoji reactions play in spreading emotions and shaping discussions in developer communities, which are traditionally considered rational and technical.

Method: Analyzed 106,743 emoji reactions across 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests in 50 popular repositories using statistical methods to detect emotional contagion patterns.

Result: Emoji reactions promote a significantly positive emotional environment in technical discussions, with positive emotional cascades outweighing negatives 23:1, confirmed by strong statistical correlation and effect size.

Conclusion: Emoji reactions actively shape emotional and collaborative dynamics in software development discussions, challenging the view that technical discourse is purely rational.

Abstract: Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate,
but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence
technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across
50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to
understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a
surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive
sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We
identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of
items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical
analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive
effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape
discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical
discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional
signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence
that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping
collaborative outcomes in software development.

*Chuhan Jiao,Zhiming Hu,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: HAGI++ introduces a multi-modal diffusion approach to improve gaze data imputation using head orientation sensors, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing gaze data in mobile eye tracking due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes hinders effective analysis for applications in behaviour research and human-computer interaction.

Method: HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model that leverages cross-modal correlations between head and eye movements, integrating additional modalities like wrist motion when available.

Result: HAGI++ outperforms existing interpolation methods and deep learning baselines on large datasets, producing realistic gaze velocity distributions and supporting pure gaze generation in extreme cases.

Conclusion: This approach enables more complete and realistic gaze data recordings, potentially improving applications like gaze-based analysis and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention
across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an
essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to
human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil
detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for
further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a
multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the
first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the
inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a
transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye
and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional
body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,
and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms
conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series
imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses
confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match
actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.
Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable
devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture
in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our
method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in
real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based
analysis and interaction across various application domains.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACC-MARL, a framework for learning decentralized team policies for multi-task, multi-agent cooperation using automata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limitations of existing approaches in multi-task, multi-agent cooperative learning, particularly the sample inefficiency and focus solely on single-task scenarios.

Method: ACC-MARL framework leverages automata to decompose complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks assigned to agents, enabling effective centralized training and decentralized execution.

Result: The framework enables task-conditioned policies that show emergent multi-step coordination among agents, demonstrated through experiments like tasks involving unlocking and holding doors.

Conclusion: ACC-MARL facilitates task-aware, decentralized multi-agent cooperation, overcoming key challenges, with optimal task assignments at test time.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoMem, a multi-agent AI framework that incorporates a dual-evolving memory mechanism to improve natural language-based planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how human-like memory contributes to multi-agent AI frameworks in natural language planning.

Method: EvoMem framework uses three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, Actor) and two memory modules—Constraint Memory (CMem) for task-specific rules and constraint tracking, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem) for iterative feedback refinement.

Result: EvoMem demonstrated improved performance in trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling during evaluations.

Conclusion: Memory plays a crucial role in enhancing multi-agent AI frameworks for planning tasks, as validated by EvoMem's success.

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving
complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have
begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within
these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents
coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where
iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the
success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present
EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The
framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)
and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries
by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a
query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by
accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory
modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip
planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance
improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success
underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study proposes a hybrid model combining Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning to enhance traffic signal control in mixed human-driven and connected autonomous vehicle scenarios, yielding significant improvements in delay, safety, and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic management systems face challenges in achieving efficient coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at intersections, necessitating a system capable of optimizing traffic flow, safety, and fairness.

Method: The study employs Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for modeling dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic, along with Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm, to optimize signal timing and vehicular movement under varying traffic conditions.

Result: The proposed system achieved a 24.1% reduction in average delay, a 29.2% decrease in traffic violations, and a significant improvement in fairness between HDVs and CAVs, validated through simulated traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The GAT-SAC framework demonstrates robust potential for improving traffic flow, safety, and equitable treatment of diverse vehicle types in real-world mixed-autonomy traffic networks.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in managing traffic at multilane intersections is
ensuring smooth coordination between human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected
autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This paper presents a novel traffic signal control
framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) reinforcement learning to address this challenge. GATs are used to model
the dynamic graph- structured nature of traffic flow to capture spatial and
temporal dependencies between lanes and signal phases. The proposed SAC is a
robust off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that enables adaptive signal
control through entropy-optimized decision making. This design allows the
system to coordinate the signal timing and vehicle movement simultaneously with
objectives focused on minimizing travel time, enhancing performance, ensuring
safety, and improving fairness between HDVs and CAVs. The model is evaluated
using a SUMO-based simulation of a four-way intersection and incorporating
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAT-SAC approach by achieving a 24.1%
reduction in average delay and up to 29.2% fewer traffic violations compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, the fairness ratio between HDVs and CAVs
improved to 1.59, indicating more equitable treatment across vehicle types.
These findings suggest that the GAT-SAC framework holds significant promise for
real-world deployment in mixed-autonomy traffic systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes UniDisMob, a unified model to generate human mobility patterns during disasters by utilizing physics-informed and meta-learning strategies, achieving significant performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a generalized model for human mobility generation during disasters to address the challenges posed by diverse disaster types and city-specific heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes UniDisMob, which combines physics-informed prompts, physics-guided alignment, and meta-learning to enable cross-disaster and cross-city generalization.

Result: UniDisMob demonstrates over 13% average performance improvement in experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully generalizes human mobility prediction during diverse disasters across multiple cities, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Human mobility generation in disaster scenarios plays a vital role in
resource allocation, emergency response, and rescue coordination. During
disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, human mobility patterns often
deviate from their normal states, which makes the task more challenging.
However, existing works usually rely on limited data from a single city or
specific disaster, significantly restricting the model's generalization
capability in new scenarios. In fact, disasters are highly sudden and
unpredictable, and any city may encounter new types of disasters without prior
experience. Therefore, we aim to develop a one-for-all model for mobility
generation that can generalize to new disaster scenarios. However, building a
universal framework faces two key challenges: 1) the diversity of disaster
types and 2) the heterogeneity among different cities. In this work, we propose
a unified model for human mobility generation in natural disasters (named
UniDisMob). To enable cross-disaster generalization, we design physics-informed
prompt and physics-guided alignment that leverage the underlying common
patterns in mobility changes after different disasters to guide the generation
process. To achieve cross-city generalization, we introduce a meta-learning
framework that extracts universal patterns across multiple cities through
shared parameters and captures city-specific features via private parameters.
Extensive experiments across multiple cities and disaster scenarios demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
an average performance improvement exceeding 13%.

TL;DR: The paper generalizes Critically-damped Langevin Diffusions (CLDs) by adding a hyperparameter for better noise control, leading to improved sampling performance in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) benefit from extended dynamics using Hamiltonian mechanics, which improve sampling, but there is room to optimize these frameworks further.

Method: Introduces a hyperparameter to the classical CLD framework to better control noise in data coordinates and derive novel bounds for sampling errors in the Wasserstein metric.

Result: The additional hyperparameter results in smoother sample paths and improved sampling accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed extension of CLDs improves generative sampling by optimizing noise application, providing better performance and practical tuning insights.

Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have achieved impressive performance in
data generation across a wide range of applications and benefit from strong
theoretical guarantees. Recently, methods inspired by statistical mechanics, in
particular, Hamiltonian dynamics, have introduced Critically-damped Langevin
Diffusions (CLDs), which define diffusion processes on extended spaces by
coupling the data with auxiliary variables. These approaches, along with their
associated score-matching and sampling procedures, have been shown to
outperform standard diffusion-based samplers numerically. In this paper, we
analyze a generalized dynamic that extends classical CLDs by introducing an
additional hyperparameter controlling the noise applied to the data coordinate,
thereby better exploiting the extended space. We further derive a novel upper
bound on the sampling error of CLD-based generative models in the Wasserstein
metric. This additional hyperparameter influences the smoothness of sample
paths, and our discretization error analysis provides practical guidance for
its tuning, leading to improved sampling performance.

TL;DR: InteracSPARQL is an interactive system that simplifies SPARQL query generation by using natural language explanations (NLEs), integrating rule-based methods and large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPARQL is difficult for non-expert users due to its complex syntax and knowledge requirements. The paper aims to make SPARQL querying more accessible.

Method: The system uses LLMs combined with a rule-based approach to generate structured explanations from SPARQL abstract syntax trees, followed by linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine queries through feedback or self-refinement.

Result: InteracSPARQL improves query accuracy, explanation clarity, and user satisfaction in evaluations using standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining rule-based methods with LLM refinements results in a more accessible and user-friendly SPARQL querying system.

Abstract: In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remained
challenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complex
syntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. To
address these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query
generation and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations
(NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement.
InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce
structured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs),
followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine
queries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the
correction of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate
InteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in
query accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to
baseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of
combining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more
accessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vortex, a platform improving upon existing ML serving systems with an SLO-first approach to optimize latencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven applications demand predictable latency for user interactions and integrated solutions, challenging existing ML serving systems with unpredictable delays.

Method: The authors propose Vortex pipelines to achieve stable and lower latencies compared to TorchServe and Ray Serve, incorporating RDMA for enhanced performance.

Result: Vortex demonstrated significantly better latency stability and throughput across workloads, surpassing existing systems even under high request rates.

Conclusion: Vortex sets a new standard for ML serving platforms by prioritizing latency objectives and scalability, especially with RDMA capabilities.

Abstract: There is growing interest in deploying ML inference and knowledge retrieval
as services that could support both interactive queries by end users and more
demanding request flows that arise from AIs integrated into a end-user
applications and deployed as agents. Our central premise is that these latter
cases will bring service level latency objectives (SLOs). Existing ML serving
platforms use batching to optimize for high throughput, exposing them to
unpredictable tail latencies. Vortex enables an SLO-first approach. For
identical tasks, Vortex's pipelines achieve significantly lower and more stable
latencies than TorchServe and Ray Serve over a wide range of workloads, often
enabling a given SLO target at more than twice the request rate. When RDMA is
available, the Vortex advantage is even more significant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the effectiveness of elastic distance measures in detecting patterns in the multivariate time series of the SWAN-SF solar flare dataset.

Method: The authors used a k-medoids clustering algorithm and compared advanced high-dimensional elastic distance metrics to the standard Euclidean distance. Thousands of experiments were conducted.

Result: Elastic distance does not outperform Euclidean distance in detecting patterns in the multivariate solar flare dataset.

Conclusion: Elastic distance measures are not effective for multivariate time series with high stochasticity, such as solar activity. They essentially collapse to Euclidean distance under these conditions.

Abstract: Solar-flare forecasting has been extensively researched yet remains an open
problem. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of elastic distance
measures for detecting patterns in the solar-flare dataset, SWAN-SF. We employ
a simple $k$-medoids clustering algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of
advanced, high-dimensional distance metrics. Our results show that, despite
thorough optimization, none of the elastic distances outperform Euclidean
distance by a significant margin. We demonstrate that, although elastic
measures have shown promise for univariate time series, when applied to the
multivariate time series of SWAN-SF, characterized by the high stochasticity of
solar activity, they effectively collapse to Euclidean distance. We conduct
thousands of experiments and present both quantitative and qualitative evidence
supporting this finding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study the relationship between approximation accuracy and numerical stability in shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks.

Method: Examines eigenvalues and eigenspaces of mass and stiffness matrices for specific node distributions on the sphere.

Result: Sharp asymptotic estimates of eigenvalues were obtained, linking smallest eigenvalues to low-degree polynomials and largest ones to high-degree polynomials.

Conclusion: Defines precise correlations between numerical stability and approximation strength of neural networks on spherical domains.

Abstract: We present an estimation of the condition numbers of the \emph{mass} and
\emph{stiffness} matrices arising from shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks defined
on the unit sphere~$\mathbb{S}^d$. In particular, when $\{\theta_j^*\}_{j=1}^n
\subset \mathbb{S}^d$ is \emph{antipodally quasi-uniform}, the condition number
is sharp. Indeed, in this case, we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates for the
full spectrum of eigenvalues and characterize the structure of the
corresponding eigenspaces, showing that the smallest eigenvalues are associated
with an eigenbasis of low-degree polynomials while the largest eigenvalues are
linked to high-degree polynomials. This spectral analysis establishes a precise
correspondence between the approximation power of the network and its numerical
stability.

### [354] [LA-MARRVEL: A Knowledge-Grounded and Language-Aware LLM Reranker for AI-MARRVEL in Rare Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02263)
*Jaeyeon Lee,Hyun-Hwan Jeong,Zhandong Liu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: LA-MARRVEL enhances gene ranking processes using expert-engineered context, large language model queries, and an aggregated ranking method, achieving stable and interpretable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipelines for diagnosing rare diseases heavily rely on clinicians to process unstructured clinical data manually, creating inefficiencies and challenges in identifying causal genes.

Method: LA-MARRVEL uses a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking mechanism over AI-MARRVEL. It integrates expert-designed context, leverages queries to a large language model, and employs rank aggregation for producing explainable gene rankings.

Result: When tested on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN), LA-MARRVEL outperformed conventional tools like Exomiser and LIRICAL in Recall@K metrics, particularly in challenging cases where the causal gene was initially ranked lower.

Conclusion: LA-MARRVEL enhances accuracy, stability, and interpretability in identifying causal genes, thereby addressing critical gaps in rare disease diagnosis workflows and enabling efficient clinical review.

Abstract: Diagnosing rare diseases often requires connecting variant-bearing genes to
evidence that is written as unstructured clinical prose, which the current
established pipelines still leave for clinicians to reconcile manually. To this
end, we introduce LA-MARRVEL, a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking
layer that operates on top of AI-MARRVEL: it supplies expert-engineered
context, queries a large language model multiple times, and aggregates the
resulting partial rankings with a ranked voting method to produce a stable,
explainable gene ranking. Evaluated on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN),
LA-MARRVEL consistently improves Recall@K over AI-MARRVEL and established
phenotype-driven tools such as Exomiser and LIRICAL, with especially large
gains on cases where the first-stage ranker placed the causal gene lower. Each
ranked gene is accompanied by LLM-generated reasoning that integrates
phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence, thereby making the output
more interpretable and facilitating clinical review.

*Ali Almuallem,Harshana Weligampola,Abhiram Gnanasambandam,Wei Xu,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Hamid R. Sheikh,Stanley H. Chan,Qi Guo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage method to optimize opto-electronic neural networks, significantly reducing resource demands while boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end optimization of opto-electronic networks faces challenges due to high simulation costs and large parameter spaces.

Method: A two-stage strategy is proposed: initially train an electronic CNN, and subsequently optimize the optical front-end metasurface array via direct kernel optimization.

Result: The proposed approach enhances training stability, reduces computational and memory requirements by hundreds of times, and doubles the accuracy for monocular depth estimation compared to end-to-end training under identical resource constraints.

Conclusion: The two-stage design is a more efficient and accurate method for developing opto-electronic neural networks, addressing key limitations of end-to-end optimization.

Abstract: Opto-electronic neural networks integrate optical front-ends with electronic
back-ends to enable fast and energy-efficient vision. However, conventional
end-to-end optimization of both the optical and electronic modules is limited
by costly simulations and large parameter spaces. We introduce a two-stage
strategy for designing opto-electronic convolutional neural networks (CNNs):
first, train a standard electronic CNN, then realize the optical front-end
implemented as a metasurface array through direct kernel optimization of its
first convolutional layer. This approach reduces computational and memory
demands by hundreds of times and improves training stability compared to
end-to-end optimization. On monocular depth estimation, the proposed two-stage
design achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training under the same
training time and resource constraints.

*Yalda Zafari,Hongyi Pan,Gorkem Durak,Ulas Bagci,Essam A. Rashed,Mohamed Mabrok*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MammoClean is a framework to address data inconsistencies and biases in mammography datasets, improving AI model generalizability and clinical reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges in mammography AI caused by variations in data quality, metadata standards, and population distributions, which create biases and hinder clinical deployment.

Method: MammoClean standardizes data selection, processes images, unifies metadata, identifies biases systematically, and evaluates its impacts on breast mammography datasets.

Result: Applying MammoClean to three datasets reveals significant distributional shifts and shows that AI models trained on poor-quality data suffer performance declines.

Conclusion: MammoClean enables the creation of bias-aware datasets, supports the development of robust AI models, and promotes fair, effective clinical solutions for diverse populations. Open-source accessibility ensures wide usability.

Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems
for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata
standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This
heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the
generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We
present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias
quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,
image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies
metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive
review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography
datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to
three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify
substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.
Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models
trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation
compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and
mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training
corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain
generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for
bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and
advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across
diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is
publicly available from: https://github.com/Minds-R-Lab/MammoClean.

### [357] [Resource-efficient Automatic Refinement of Segmentations via Weak Supervision from Light Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02576)
*Alix de Langlais,Benjamin Billot,Théo Aguilar Vidal,Marc-Olivier Gauci,Hervé Delingette*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCORE, an efficient weakly supervised framework to refine medical image segmentation using minimal training feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation in medical imaging is accurate but labor-intensive and prone to variability, highlighting the need for automated yet clinically reliable methods.

Method: SCORE employs a weakly supervised approach focusing on region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels, avoiding dense annotations.

Result: SCORE enhances segmentation predictions for humerus CT scans from TotalSegmentator, achieving comparable performance to existing methods with reduced annotation effort.

Conclusion: SCORE demonstrates the potential for efficient segmentation refinement while significantly lowering supervision requirements and time.

Abstract: Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis.
Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to
variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently,
a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across
diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the
clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can
improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or
require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE
(Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised
framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback
during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image
annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality
scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on
humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from
TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement
methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation
time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.

*Asrin Efe Yorulmaz,Tamer Başar*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper achieves a faster convergence rate to Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in Markov games by improving the rate from $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$ using advanced adaptive step-size techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and convergence rates of no-regret learning dynamics in Markov games, which are critical for achieving decentralized equilibrium in game theory.

Method: The authors utilize adaptive step-size techniques from no-regret algorithms and extend them to Markov games through a stage-wise learning scheme based on real-time feedback. They employ Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL) adjusted for value-iteration-based learning.

Result: The proposed self-play algorithm achieves a refined convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$ to CCE, significantly improving over previous work and scaling better with action set size.

Conclusion: This work pushes the boundaries of no-regret learning in Markov games, offering faster convergence rates and more efficient scaling, beneficial for high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: No-regret learning dynamics play a central role in game theory, enabling
decentralized convergence to equilibrium for concepts such as Coarse Correlated
Equilibrium (CCE) or Correlated Equilibrium (CE). In this work, we improve the
convergence rate to CCE in general-sum Markov games, reducing it from the
previously best-known rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^5 T / T)$ to a sharper
$\mathcal{O}(\log T / T)$. This matches the best known convergence rate for CE
in terms of $T$, number of iterations, while also improving the dependence on
the action set size from polynomial to polylogarithmic-yielding exponential
gains in high-dimensional settings. Our approach builds on recent advances in
adaptive step-size techniques for no-regret algorithms in normal-form games,
and extends them to the Markovian setting via a stage-wise scheme that adjusts
learning rates based on real-time feedback. We frame policy updates as an
instance of Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL), customized for
value-iteration-based learning. The resulting self-play algorithm achieves, to
our knowledge, the fastest known convergence rate to CCE in Markov games.

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continuum, a system to improve efficiency in serving multi-turn agentic LLM workflows by optimizing KV cache management and scheduling. It addresses latency issues by considering tool calls and inter-turn pauses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in serving multi-turn agentic LLM workflows, particularly the latency caused by pauses between tool calls and LLM requests, which leads to cache evictions and extra processing time.

Method: Continuum employs tool-aware KV cache timeout management and program-level first-come-first-serve scheduling. By predicting tool call durations and pinning the KV cache with time-to-live values, it optimizes multi-turn throughput and prevents latency issues.

Result: The system significantly improves average job completion times for real-world agentic workloads, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across different hardware setups and configurations.

Conclusion: Continuum effectively optimizes multi-turn LLM agent workloads by reducing latency, preserving continuity between requests, and enhancing overall system throughput. This approach is validated on real-world benchmarks, showing its applicability and efficiency.

Abstract: Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls.
These tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses
between LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system,
especially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache
eviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the
following LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem
becomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous
works either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV
cache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of
a multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases
per-request latency.
  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for
multi-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with
program-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic
workflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a
time-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level
first-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves
multi-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic
workflows. By modeling the variability of tool call and agent program
continuity, Continuum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation on
real-world agentic workloads (SWE-Bench and BFCL) with Llama-3.1 8B/70B models
shows that Continuum significantly improves the average job completion times,
and remains performant across different hardware setups and DRAM offloading
schemes. Preview code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient, flexible, and faster tool for solving the SLOPE (Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation) problem across a variety of platforms and programming languages.

Method: A hybrid coordinate descent algorithm was implemented, allowing the packages to fit generalized linear models (GLMs) while supporting diverse loss functions and data structures. It also includes features like full SLOPE path fitting and cross-validation.

matrices) and are designed to efficiently fit the full SLOPE path as well as
handle cross-validation of SLOPE models, including the relaxed SLOPE. We
present examples of how to use the packages and benchmarks that demonstrate the
performance of the packages on both real and simulated data and show that our

### [361] [BondBERT: What we learn when assigning sentiment in the bond market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01869)
*Toby Barter,Zheng Gao,Eva Christodoulaki,Jing Chen,John Cartlidge*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The paper introduces BondBERT, a sentiment analysis model tailored to bond market news, which provides more suitable predictions for bond returns compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bond markets respond uniquely to macroeconomic news, often inversely to economic optimism, making standard sentiment models unsuitable for bond-specific analysis.

Method: The authors fine-tuned BondBERT, a transformer-based model, on 30,000 UK bond market-specific news articles from 2018 to 2025. They validated its sentiment predictions through comparison against other models using correlation, accuracy analysis, and forecasting metrics.

Result: BondBERT demonstrated positive correlations with bond returns, superior alignment and forecasting accuracy, and reduced RMSE compared to FinBERT, FinGPT, and Instruct-FinGPT.

Conclusion: Domain-specific sentiment models like BondBERT yield better insights into bond market dynamics, addressing a critical gap in NLP applications for financial analytics.

Abstract: Bond markets respond differently to macroeconomic news compared to equity
markets, yet most sentiment models, including FinBERT, are trained primarily on
general financial or equity news data. This mismatch is important because bond
prices often move in the opposite direction to economic optimism, making
general or equity-based sentiment tools potentially misleading. In this paper,
we introduce BondBERT, a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on
bond-specific news. BondBERT can act as the perception and reasoning component
of a financial decision-support agent, providing sentiment signals that
integrate with forecasting models. It is a generalisable framework for adapting
transformers to low-volatility, domain-inverse sentiment tasks by compiling and
cleaning 30,000 UK bond market articles (2018--2025) for training, validation,
and testing. We compare BondBERT's sentiment predictions against FinBERT,
FinGPT, and Instruct-FinGPT using event-based correlation, up/down accuracy
analyses, and LSTM forecasting across ten UK sovereign bonds. We find that
BondBERT consistently produces positive correlations with bond returns,
achieves higher alignment and forecasting accuracy than the three baseline
models, with lower normalised RMSE and higher information coefficient. These
results demonstrate that domain-specific sentiment adaptation better captures
fixed income dynamics, bridging a gap between NLP advances and bond market
analytics.

### [362] [Modeling Hawkish-Dovish Latent Beliefs in Multi-Agent Debate-Based LLMs for Monetary Policy Decision Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02469)
*Kaito Takano,Masanori Hirano,Kei Nakagawa*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: The study introduces a novel framework that mimics the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) collective decision-making using large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for more accurate interest rate decision predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper was motivated by the need for better predictions of central bank policy decisions, especially those by the FOMC, amidst increasing economic uncertainty. Existing models fail to capture the deliberative nature of policymaking.

Method: The method imitates FOMC's decision-making by involving multiple LLM agents, each with an initial belief. These agents iteratively adjust forecasts based on qualitative texts and quantitative macroeconomic data, exchanging outputs to simulate discussion and consensus-building.

Result: The proposed debate-based framework achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy compared to standard baseline models.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling beliefs not only enhances prediction accuracy but also improves understanding of how individual perspectives and social interactions influence collective policy forecasts.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting central bank policy decisions, particularly those of
the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) has become increasingly important amid
heightened economic uncertainty. While prior studies have used monetary policy
texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that
overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel
framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making
process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents.
Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction
based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic
indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by
observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus
formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable
representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we
theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input
information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this
debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines
in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides
insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective
policy forecasts.
