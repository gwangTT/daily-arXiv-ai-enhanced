Visuomotor learning offers a promising\nalternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low\nsignal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and\nmillimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This\npaper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor\npolicies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a\nsingle stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic\ngrasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical\nobjects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything\nfor Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.\nGASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception\npipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for\nsafe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization\nfor sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based\nand ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.\nExtensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both\nsettings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse\ndisturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a novel framework, GASv2, for automated surgical grasping using a single stereo camera, achieving 65% success rates and generalization to unseen objects in real-world surgical contexts.", "motivation": "To reduce surgeon workload and enhance efficiency and consistency in robot-assisted surgeries by automating the grasping process, which currently suffers from dependence on handcrafted features and poor generalization.", "method": "Introduces GASv2, a visuomotor learning framework that combines world-model-based architecture, a surgical perception pipeline, domain randomization for training, and a hybrid control system for safe execution.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges.
