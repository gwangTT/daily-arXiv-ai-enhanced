### [1] [Prescriptive Agents based on Rag for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714)
*Chitranshu Harbola,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Large Language Model-based system for prescriptive machinery maintenance, combining bearing vibration analysis with intelligent maintenance planning to offer detailed, actionable recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning in industrial machinery, preventing failures and optimizing efficiency.

Method: An integrated approach using bearing vibration frequency analysis (serializing data for LLMs), multi-agentic processing of manuals and web search for semantic guidance, and the Gemini model to output structured recommendations.

Result: The system demonstrated effective anomaly detection, classification of fault types and severity, and provided contextually relevant maintenance guidance during experimental validation.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances industrial maintenance by providing a scalable, intelligent decision-support framework, advancing the use of LLMs in diverse machinery and sectors.

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoFlow introduces a method for automating geospatial workflows, improving agentic success and efficiency compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for geospatial tasks lacked detailed instructions for API invocation, limiting success rates and increasing resource utilization.

Method: GeoFlow provides agents with explicit tool-calling objectives for guiding geospatial API usage during runtime.

Result: GeoFlow enhances agentic success by 6.8% and cuts down token consumption by up to four times compared to leading approaches.

Conclusion: GeoFlow demonstrates more efficient and successful geospatial workflow automation compared to existing methods, making it a significant improvement in LLM-related tasks.

Abstract: We present GeoFlow, a method that automatically generates agentic workflows
for geospatial tasks. Unlike prior work that focuses on reasoning decomposition
and leaves API selection implicit, our method provides each agent with detailed
tool-calling objectives to guide geospatial API invocation at runtime. GeoFlow
increases agentic success by 6.8% and reduces token usage by up to fourfold
across major LLM families compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### [3] [Who is a Better Player: LLM against LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04720)
*Yingjie Zhou,Jiezhang Cao,Farong Wen,Li Xu,Yanwei Jiang,Jun Jia,Ronghui Li,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Zhou,Xiongkuo Min,Jie Guo,Zicheng Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) using board games instead of traditional Q&A benchmarks, proposing a framework that incorporates technical and emotional metrics to assess their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI benchmarks rely heavily on Q&A datasets, which limit assessing strategic reasoning and adaptability. Introducing an adversarial board game framework addresses these limitations.

Method: The authors developed Qi Town, a platform supporting five games and 20 LLM players. They used Elo ratings, Performance Loop Graphs (PLGs), and Positive Sentiment Scores (PSS) in a round-robin tournament format to quantify LLM performance.

Result: Experimental findings revealed that LLMs are optimistic in challenging environments and adapt better than humans under stress. However, cyclic win-loss patterns from PLGs highlight skill instability during gameplay.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strategic adaptability but exhibit unstable gameplay performance. The framework provides insights into both technical capabilities and emotional resilience, opening avenues for deeper investigation.

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

### [4] [Fine-Tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for Autonomous Web-based Geographical Information Systems (AWebGIS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04846)
*Mahdi Nazari Ashani,Ali Asghar Alesheikh,Saba Kazemi,Kimya Kheirkhah,Yasin Mohammadi,Fatemeh Rezaie,Amir Mahdi Manafi,Hedieh Zarkesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores methods for Autonomous Web-based GIS using natural language inputs, comparing online cloud-based, semi-automated offline, and fully autonomous client-side approaches. The client-side method using a fine-tuned T5-small model achieved the highest accuracy while ensuring privacy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create hands-free and intelligent interaction for geospatial operations while addressing privacy, scalability, and independence from cloud-based large language models.

Method: The study compares three methods: cloud-based LLMs, semi-automated machine learning classifiers, and a fully autonomous client-side fine-tuned T5-small model running in browsers.

Result: The client-side approach using the T5-small model demonstrated superior accuracy (exact match accuracy 0.93, Levenshtein similarity 0.99, ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores of 0.98) and eliminated server-based inference.

Conclusion: Browser-executable models like the fine-tuned T5-small can provide an efficient, privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for geospatial operations in AWebGIS.

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

### [5] [Large Language Models Reasoning Abilities Under Non-Ideal Conditions After RL-Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04848)
*Chang Tian,Matthew B. Blaschko,Mingzhe Xing,Xiuxing Li,Yinliang Yue,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines how reinforcement learning (RL)-trained large language and vision-language models struggle with reasoning in non-ideal scenarios, despite performing well in ideal ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs), which predominantly assess reasoning abilities in idealized conditions, ignoring performance in realistic, imperfect scenarios.

Method: The authors fine-tuned three LLMs and one LVLM using a policy-gradient RL algorithm and tested performance across eight datasets in three non-ideal scenarios: summary inference, noise suppression, and contextual filtering. Scenario-specific remediation methods were also proposed.

Result: While RL fine-tuning enhances reasoning under ideal conditions, all models exhibited significant performance degradation in non-ideal settings, revealing key limitations. Proposed remediation methods had limited success.

Conclusion: This paper underscores the need to evaluate and improve reasoning abilities of large models in realistic, non-ideal scenarios, as current methods inadequately address these challenges.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

### [6] [ConfAgents: A Conformal-Guided Multi-Agent Framework for Cost-Efficient Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04915)
*Huiya Zhao,Yinghao Zhu,Zixiang Wang,Yasha Wang,Junyi Gao,Liantao Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthFlow is a self-evolving AI agent designed to improve strategic planning in healthcare research, using a novel meta-level evolution mechanism and evaluated through a new benchmark, EHRFlowBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents in healthcare lack the ability to improve their strategic planning capabilities, which limits their effectiveness in complex healthcare domains.

Method: HealthFlow introduces a meta-level evolution mechanism to autonomously refine its problem-solving policies by learning from procedural successes and failures. The researchers also developed EHRFlowBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI in healthcare tasks.

Result: HealthFlow's self-evolving approach outperforms current state-of-the-art AI frameworks in healthcare research tasks.

Conclusion: This research highlights a shift from creating better tool-users to designing smarter, autonomous task-managers, improving AI's role in scientific discovery.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

### [7] [The Docking Game: Loop Self-Play for Fast, Dynamic, and Accurate Prediction of Flexible Protein--Ligand Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05006)
*Youzhi Zhang,Yufei Li,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new game-theoretic framework, "Docking Game," and the Loop Self-Play algorithm to improve ligand docking and protein pocket docking by modeling them as interacting players, achieving a 10% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge where current multi-task learning models underperform in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking due to structural complexities.

Method: The method involves proposing the Docking Game framework with two interacting players and introducing the LoopPlay algorithm, which uses a dual-loop mechanism for mutual adaptation and refinement between ligand and protein docking models.

Result: LoopPlay achieves a 10% improvement in predicting binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: This innovative game-theoretic approach and the LoopPlay algorithm show strong potential to enhance molecular docking's accuracy, thus aiding in drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

### [8] [Can Large Language Models Integrate Spatial Data? Empirical Insights into Reasoning Strengths and Computational Weaknesses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05009)
*Bin Han,Robert Wolfe,Anat Caspi,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) for improving spatial data integration processes, revealing challenges in spatial reasoning and suggesting a review-and-refine methodology for effective results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spatial data integration are limited—rule-based systems fail to address edge cases, while machine learning approaches require extensive labeled samples. The study aims to leverage LLMs as innovative tools for improving these processes.

Method: The research evaluates LLMs’ ability to integrate urban spatial datasets by analyzing spatial relationships and applying a review-and-refine technique to correct initial missteps of the models.

Result: While LLMs demonstrate partial spatial reasoning capabilities, they struggle with large-scale spatial tasks; however, providing them with relevant features significantly improves their performance. The review-and-refine method effectively improves accuracy by correcting errors.

Conclusion: LLMs are positioned as promising tools for spatial data integration tasks, though they require methodological adjustments such as review-and-refine processes. Future work could target training improvements, multi-modal data integration, and supporting varied data formats.

Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs) to empower domain
experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

### [9] [Cognitive Duality for Adaptive Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05081)
*Jiarun Liu,Chunhong Zhang,Zheng Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogniWeb, an agent architecture combining fast and slow cognitive processes, achieving competitive performance in web navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating AGI in web navigation, where existing methods struggle to balance offline learning of reactive behaviors and online acquisition of planning skills.

Method: Inspired by dual-process theory, the authors developed CogniWeb, a modular architecture that toggles between fast intuitive processing and slow deliberate reasoning based on task demands.

Result: CogniWeb was evaluated in WebArena, achieving a success rate of 43.96% and a 75% reduction in token usage, showcasing efficiency and competitiveness.

Conclusion: CogniWeb effectively integrates reactive and deliberative processes, bridging gaps in current approaches while showing promise in challenging web navigation tasks.

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

### [10] [MedMKEB: A Comprehensive Knowledge Editing Benchmark for Medical Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05083)
*Dexuan Xu,Jieyi Wang,Zhongyan Chai,Yongzhi Cao,Hanpin Wang,Huamin Zhang,Yu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedMKEB is the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal medical knowledge editing in MLLMs, addressing counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge transfer, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for dynamic updating of outdated or incorrect information in multimodal large language models tailored for medical applications.

Method: The authors developed MedMKEB, a benchmark built on a medical visual question-answering dataset, enriched with diverse editing tasks and validated by human experts.

Result: Experiments revealed limitations in existing medical MLLMs' editing approaches, emphasizing the need for specialized strategies.

Conclusion: MedMKEB provides a standard benchmark to advance efficient and reliable medical knowledge editing in multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

### [11] [EasySize: Elastic Analog Circuit Sizing via LLM-Guided Heuristic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05113)
*Xinyue Wu,Fan Hu,Shaik Jani Babu,Yi Zhao,Xinfei Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EasySize, a lightweight gate sizing framework based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, delivers excellent cross-technology applicability and efficiency in analog circuit design, outperforming existing methods with reduced simulation resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing analog circuits is a challenging and experience-driven task that suffers from inefficiencies. Current AI-driven methods have limitations, including dependency on large model sizes and lack of adaptability across technology nodes.

Method: The paper introduces EasySize, which employs a finetuned Qwen3-8B model and integrates heuristic search techniques like Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), dynamically optimizing task-specific loss functions based on the Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics.

Result: EasySize demonstrates impressive performance across various technology nodes (180nm, 45nm, and 22nm) despite being trained only on a 350nm node. It outperforms AutoCkt on 86.67% of tasks and reduces simulation resources by over 96.67%.

Conclusion: EasySize represents a significant step forward by reducing dependence on human expertise and computational resources in analog circuit gate sizing, thereby simplifying and expediting the design process. The authors plan to open-source the framework.

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

### [12] [Beyond Automation: Socratic AI, Epistemic Agency, and the Implications of the Emergence of Orchestrated Multi-Agent Learning Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05116)
*Peer-Benedikt Degen,Igor Asanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study explores the use of a Socratic AI Tutor to enhance critical student thinking, proposing a shift towards modular AI systems in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address concerns about generative AI leading to de-skilling among students while exploring its potential to enhance metacognitive engagement.

Method: A controlled experiment was conducted with 65 students comparing a Socratic AI Tutor grounded in constructivist theory to an uninstructed AI chatbot.

Result: The Socratic AI Tutor showed significantly higher support for independent, critical, and reflective thinking compared to standard AI chatbots.

Conclusion: The researchers propose modular multi-agent AI systems and adapted instructional models to promote diverse learning trajectories, emphasizing scalability and pedagogical alignment.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

### [13] [Graph-based Event Log Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05145)
*Sebastiano Dissegna,Chiara Di Francescomarino,Massimiliano Ronzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) method for reconstructing missing event attributes in process mining logs, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of incomplete event logs in process mining by creating a more natural and expressive model to reconstruct missing information in traces.

Method: Develop a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to process incomplete traces and predict missing attributes. The model was evaluated against existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: The proposed HGNN model outperformed existing autoencoder-based approaches in reconstructing various event attributes, offering better coverage and accuracy.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks offer a promising solution for event attribute reconstruction in process mining, demonstrating superior effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

### [14] [QA-Dragon: Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05197)
*Zhuohang Jiang,Pangjing Wu,Xu Yuan,Wenqi Fan,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces QA-Dragon, a system designed to enhance knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) through dynamic retrieval from both text and images, leading to better reasoning and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods fail to effectively handle complex queries requiring multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date knowledge due to their reliance on either text or image retrieval in isolation.

Method: QA-Dragon uses a domain router to determine the subject domain for reasoning and a search router to dynamically select retrieval strategies that integrate text and image searches, enabling multimodal and multi-hop reasoning.

Result: QA-Dragon was evaluated at the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge (KDD Cup 2025) and outperformed baseline models with improvements of 5.06% in single-source tasks, 6.35% in multi-source tasks, and 5.03% in multi-turn tasks.

Conclusion: The QA-Dragon framework significantly improves the reasoning performance in complex VQA scenarios by effectively integrating multimodal retrieval strategies, demonstrating its capability to enhance accuracy and knowledge overlap.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional communication methods struggle with challenges like information overload and delayed response times in large maintenance organizations.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining RDF graph databases with large language models (LLMs) to process natural language queries, integrated into a transparent planning-orchestration architecture.

Result: The solution enhances audience targeting by allowing communication owners to conduct intuitive and explainable queries related to organizational concepts.

Conclusion: The framework improves communication efficiency and maintains trust in the system through explainable and intuitive reasoning.

Abstract: In large-scale maintenance organizations, identifying subject matter experts
and managing communications across complex entities relationships poses
significant challenges -- including information overload and longer response
times -- that traditional communication approaches fail to address effectively.
We propose a novel framework that combines RDF graph databases with LLMs to
process natural language queries for precise audience targeting, while
providing transparent reasoning through a planning-orchestration architecture.
Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture combining decision trees and LLMs to enhance reasoning capabilities across structured and unstructured inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of loose coupling in prior neuro-symbolic systems by integrating interpretable symbolic reasoning with the generative and contextual strengths of LLMs.

Method: The system incorporates decision trees and random forests as callable modules within a multi-agent framework managed by a central orchestrator, enabling consistent reasoning and communication between components.

Result: The architecture improves reasoning benchmarks like ProofWriter (+7.2%), GSM8k (+5.3%), and ARC (+6.0%), demonstrating better consistency, mathematical problem-solving, and abstraction accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides an interpretable, robust, and extendable solution for neuro-symbolic reasoning, with applications in domains like healthcare and scientific discovery.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper argues for redefining the term 'agent' in AI by proposing a multidimensional framework to enhance research clarity and policy development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in the interpretation of 'agent' in AI has led to challenges in research communication, system evaluation, and policy formulation, necessitating a clearer framework.

Method: The paper leverages historical analysis and contemporary usage patterns to propose minimum requirements and a multidimensional spectrum to define 'agent.'

Result: The framework provides precise vocabulary for describing systems, preserves the term's multifaceted nature, and suggests recommendations for terminology standardization.

Conclusion: Redefining 'agent' through this framework will enhance clarity, reproducibility in research, and support improved policies in the field of artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NomicLaw, a multi-agent simulation where LLMs collaboratively make laws by proposing rules, justifying them, and voting. It examines trust, reciprocity, and strategic behavior among LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of empirical understanding of LLM behavior in multi-agent settings, especially in deliberating legal and ethical dilemmas.

Method: Developing NomicLaw, a simulation environment where LLMs interact via proposing, justifying, and voting on legal rules while their qualitative and quantitative behaviors are analyzed.

Result: Findings showed LLMs exhibit social reasoning traits like alliance formation, trust betrayal, and rhetoric adaptation, showcasing latent persuasive and collaborative abilities.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of LLMs in autonomous negotiation and legal drafting, highlighting their ability to perform sophisticated social reasoning and persuasive actions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

### [19] [Minimal Model Reasoning in Description Logics: Don't Try This at Home!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05350)
*Federica Di Stefano,Quentin Manière,Magdalena Ortiz,Mantas Šimkus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores reasoning with minimal models in Description Logics (DLs) and finds concept satisfiability to be undecidable even for simple DLs like \( \mathcal{EL} \). By applying acyclicity conditions, decidability is recovered, and complexities are analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve understanding of reasoning with minimal models in Description Logics, a topic that remains unclear and challenging.

Method: The authors investigate reasoning with pure minimal models in DLs, analyze concept satisfiability, impose acyclicity conditions, examine data complexity, and connect findings to pointwise circumscription studies.

Result: Key results include the undecidability of concept satisfiability for even basic DLs like \( \mathcal{EL} \), recovery of decidability under acyclicity conditions, and identification of ExpSpace-hardness in DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Conclusion: Understanding reasoning in DLs with minimal models is complex and challenging. Employing acyclicity conditions helps regain decidability, but the computational complexity remains high. New insights into DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$ further underline these difficulties.

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces StructVRM, enhancing multimodal reasoning models with fine-grained reward systems for handling complex questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve vision-language model performance in complex reasoning tasks with partial correctness.

Method: StructVRM employs a model-based verifier for sub-question feedback, emphasizing semantic and mathematical equivalence.

Result: Seed-StructVRM achieves state-of-the-art results in six public multimodal benchmarks and a challenging STEM-focused benchmark.

Conclusion: Structured, verifiable rewards significantly enhance multimodal model reasoning capabilities in intricate tasks.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel real-time predictive maintenance pipeline for Intelligent Transportation Systems that combines fault detection and explainability, achieving high accuracy and F-measure with practical implications in railway safety, cost, and availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance proactive maintenance in railway operations through real-time fault prediction and decision-making support systems.

Method: The method integrates sample pre-processing for feature generation, incremental machine learning classification, and explainable outcomes within an online pipeline.

Result: Experiments on the MetroPT dataset achieved 99% accuracy and above 98% F-measure, demonstrating robustness against class imbalance and noise.

Conclusion: The approach is validated as methodologically sound and practically applicable, providing early fault detection and actionable insights for transportation systems.

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have notable visual reasoning skills but struggle in detailed attention, precise planning, and applying physical principles for complex tasks. The paper introduces DeepPHY, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' understanding of physics through simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Vision Language Models in tackling real-world tasks requiring nuanced physical reasoning and complex planning.

Method: The study proposes DeepPHY, a benchmarking framework combining various physical reasoning environments and detailed evaluation metrics to systematically assess VLMs' capabilities.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate challenges in converting descriptive physical knowledge into accurate and predictive control within simulated tasks.

Conclusion: Current VLMs require significant advancements to effectively handle complex environments where understanding and application of physical principles are critical.

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs are transforming organic synthesis by providing new tools for chemists to run and plan experiments, ultimately enabling faster, greener, and safer research.

Method: The paper surveys the integration of LLMs with complementary technologies like graph neural networks, quantum calculations, and spectroscopy, and evaluates their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Result: LLMs have significantly enhanced chemistry research by enabling faster discovery cycles, greener methods, and autonomous lab operations, while also highlighting ongoing challenges like dataset bias and decision-making transparency.

Conclusion: The advancements in LLM technologies pave the way for more inclusive, efficient, and safe molecular innovation, with human oversight remaining a critical component.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges in aligning AI systems with societal norms and goals, focusing on geographic variability in alignment due to cultural and political differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the need to study how societal norms, cultural diversity, and geographic context affect AI alignment, particularly as AI systems increasingly mediate knowledge and decisions for global users.

Method: The paper reviews existing geographical issues, suggests research directions, and proposes methods to evaluate AI alignment sensitivity to geographic and cultural context.

Result: The paper highlights gaps in AI alignment research regarding geographic and cultural variability and emphasizes the need for spatio-temporal awareness in alignment approaches.

Conclusion: One-size-fits-all solutions are insufficient, and developing geographically sensitive AI alignment strategies is crucial for addressing unequal or culturally inappropriate outcomes.

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bench-2-CoP, a framework revealing the mismatch between current AI benchmarks and EU AI Act requirements, especially in evaluating systemic risks such as loss of control and cyber offences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the misalignment between current AI evaluation benchmarks and the regulatory focus on systemic risks as highlighted by emerging frameworks such as the EU AI Act.

Method: The method involves using a framework called Bench-2-CoP, which employs validated LLM-as-judge analysis to compare 194,955 benchmark questions against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities and propensities.

Result: The study finds a severe misalignment, with benchmarks heavily focused on behavioral propensities like hallucination and bias, while neglecting functional capabilities critical for systemic risks such as loss of control and autonomous AI development.

Conclusion: The paper suggests the need for a drastic overhaul of evaluation tools to address this benchmark-regulation gap, aiming to create safer and more regulatory-compliant AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

TL;DR: The paper uses a small, resource-efficient LLM to generate synthetic datasets for emotion recognition in conversations, improving robustness and performance on existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A lack of diverse ERC datasets and the limitations of traditional LLMs in affordable data generation for the task.

Method: Employing a small, general-purpose LLM to synthesize six diverse datasets for supplementing three widely used ERC benchmarks, and evaluating their impact on ERC classification and label imbalance.

Result: Generated datasets allow ERC classifiers to achieve strong robustness and statistically significant improvements when tested on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the feasibility and utility of using a resource-efficient LLM for enhancing ERC tasks, addressing data scarcity and label imbalance challenges.

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

Motivation: Current methods to improve reasoning capabilities in LLMs post-training are resource intensive and rely on heuristic strategies, limiting scalability.

Method: The paper proposes InfiAlign, which combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), along with a robust data selection pipeline to curate high-quality alignment data automatically.

Result: Using the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, InfiAlign achieves comparable performance to a larger model while using only 12% of the training data, with an average improvement of 3.89% on mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining scalable data selection and full-stage post-training to efficiently align LLMs for reasoning, providing a practical and extensible solution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods struggle with structured data like knowledge graphs, facing issues such as information gaps and redundancy, which undermine reasoning performance.

Method: The authors propose GRAIL, a combination of LLM-guided random exploration and path filtering for fine-grained reasoning trajectory synthesis, coupled with a two-stage training process to dynamically decide reasoning actions at each step.

Result: GRAIL exhibits an average accuracy enhancement of 21.01% and F1 improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets.

Conclusion: GRAIL effectively addresses precision-conciseness challenges in graph retrieval and enables autonomous exploration and reasoning, improving reasoning performance in structured knowledge tasks. The code and datasets are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

### [29] [Auto-Eval Judge: Towards a General Agentic Framework for Task Completion Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05508)
*Roshita Bhonsle,Rishav Dutta,Sneha Vavilapalli,Harsh Seth,Abubakarr Jaye,Yapei Chang,Mukund Rungta,Emmanuel Aboah Boateng,Sadid Hasan,Ehi Nosakhare,Soundar Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalizable and modular evaluation framework for assessing agent task completion, addressing limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are increasingly being used as agents, but existing evaluation methods fail to adequately assess step-by-step reasoning, prompting the need for a broader and more robust evaluation framework.

Method: The framework imitates human-like evaluation by breaking tasks into sub-tasks and verifying each reasoning step using modular components. Outputs from the modules are aggregated to determine overall task completion.

Result: The framework was tested on the Magentic-One Actor Agent using GAIA and BigCodeBench benchmarks, demonstrating 4.76% and 10.52% better alignment with human evaluations compared to GPT-4o's LLM-as-a-Judge.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows enhanced reliability and accuracy in evaluating agent actions across diverse tasks, establishing its potential as a universal evaluation system.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

*Meryem Yilmaz Soylu,Adrian Gallard,Jeonghyun Lee,Gayane Grigoryan,Rushil Desai,Stephen Harmon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LORI, an AI-driven tool for evaluating leadership skills in recommendation letters using advanced NLP models like RoBERTa and LLAMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reviewing letters of recommendation manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the paper aims to support admissions committees by automating the evaluation process.

Method: They use natural language processing techniques with models such as RoBERTa and LLAMA to detect leadership attributes like teamwork, communication, and innovation in LORs.

Result: The proposed RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1 score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, indicating strong performance.

Conclusion: LORI can streamline graduate admissions and enable better evaluation of candidates’ leadership skills, especially important in STEM fields.

Abstract: Letters of recommendation (LORs) provide valuable insights into candidates'
capabilities and experiences beyond standardized test scores. However,
reviewing these text-heavy materials is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To
address this challenge and support the admission committee in providing
feedback for students' professional growth, our study introduces LORI: LOR
Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural
language processing and leveraging large language models using RoBERTa and
LLAMA, we seek to identify leadership attributes such as teamwork,
communication, and innovation. Our latest RoBERTa model achieves a weighted F1
score of 91.6%, a precision of 92.4%, and a recall of 91.6%, showing a strong
level of consistency in our test data. With the growing importance of
leadership skills in the STEM sector, integrating LORI into the graduate
admissions process is crucial for accurately assessing applicants' leadership
capabilities. This approach not only streamlines the admissions process but
also automates and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation of candidates'
capabilities.

### [31] [MV-Debate: Multi-view Agent Debate with Dynamic Reflection Gating for Multimodal Harmful Content Detection in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05557)
*Rui Lu,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Feng Xiao,Yuntao Du,Yijun Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called MV-Debate for detecting harmful content in social media using a multi-agent system that leverages different interpretive perspectives and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of identifying harmful intent on social media, such as cross-modal contradictions, cultural shifts, and subtle cues in multimodal content.

Method: Proposes MV-Debate, a multi-agent framework with four specialized agents—surface analyst, deep reasoner, modality contrast, and social contextualist—that iteratively debate and refine their analyses based on a reflection-gain criterion.

Result: MV-Debate showed significant performance improvements over strong single-model baselines and existing multi-agent debate baselines on three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate frameworks like MV-Debate show great potential for improving social intent detection, especially in safety-critical online contexts.

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

### [32] [The Missing Reward: Active Inference in the Era of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05619)
*Bo Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the potential of Active Inference (AIF) to enable autonomous AI without reliance on human reward engineering, addressing scalability issues in current AI paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scalability issues in AI stemming from dependence on human-designed rewards and inadequate ability of systems to autonomously adapt to dynamic environments.

Method: The authors propose leveraging Active Inference (AIF) with Large Language Models. AIF ensures agents minimize free energy and balance exploration-exploitation autonomously with a Bayesian framework.

Result: Using AIF as a framework, the authors outline a pathway to create agents capable of autonomous learning from experiences while aligning with human values and adhering to constraints.

Conclusion: AIF bridges the "grounded-agency gap" by replacing external rewards with intrinsic objectives, offering a scalable foundation for autonomous AI development.

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

*Yu Yuan,Lili Zhao,Wei Chen,Guangting Zheng,Kai Zhang,Mengdi Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework using LLMs to simulate human learning dynamics with various learning profiles, analyzing cognitive growth over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to track human learning dynamics, provide explainability, or map realistic progress in cognitive processes.

Method: Developed LearnerAgent framework using profiles like Deep, Surface, Lazy, and General Learner, conducting a full-year simulation with weekly tests, strategic decisions, and peer interactions for learning analysis.

Result: Findings include sustained cognitive growth in Deep Learner, shallow knowledge diagnosis in Surface Learner, realistic self-concept evolution for learners, and identifying the base LLM as a 'diligent but brittle Surface Learner.'

Conclusion: LearnerAgent effectively simulates learning environments, aiding analysis of LLM behaviors and providing insights into human-like learning processes.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

### [34] [Understanding and Mitigating Errors of LLM-Generated RTL Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05266)
*Jiazheng Zhang,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper analyzes errors in large language model (LLM)-based RTL code generation and proposes targeted techniques to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success rate of LLM-based RTL code generation is low, and a lack of understanding about error causes hinders progress.

Method: The authors conducted error analysis, created error correction techniques (like a domain-specific knowledge base, retrieval-augmented generation, design rules, and tools for multimodal inputs), and employed iterative debugging.

Result: By applying these techniques, their framework achieved 91.0% accuracy on the VerilogEval benchmark, improving performance by 32.7% over the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed error correction strategies significantly enhance LLM-based RTL code generation, effectively addressing common error causes.

Abstract: Despite the promising potential of large language model (LLM) based
register-transfer-level (RTL) code generation, the overall success rate remains
unsatisfactory. Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding
of specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a
comprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal
that most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient
RTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous
design descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.
Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction
techniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and
employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.
To mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and
implement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we
integrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.
For remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error
localization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based
framework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error
correction techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation
framework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental
results show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\% accuracy on the
VerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by
32.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces relOBI, a modified Open Bus Interface (OBI) that enhances reliability in radiation-heavy environments using TMR and ECC, showing zero vulnerabilities to soft errors with area and timing trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address reliability issues in SoC interconnects that are prone to functional failures due to soft errors in radiation-heavy environments.

Method: The method involves extending the existing Open Bus Interface (OBI) with triple modular redundancy (TMR) for critical signals and error correction codes (ECC) for other signals.

Result: The implementation of relOBI achieves zero vulnerability to injected faults, reducing the error rate from 34.85% to 0%, with a 2.6x area increase and 1.4x impact on timing.

Conclusion: relOBI effectively enhances reliability in SoC interconnects with significant improvements over previous techniques, albeit with some area and timing overhead.

Abstract: On-chip communication is a critical element of modern systems-on-chip (SoCs),
allowing processor cores to interact with memory and peripherals. Interconnects
require special care in radiation-heavy environments, as any soft error within
the SoC interconnect is likely to cause a functional failure of the whole SoC.
This work proposes relOBI, an extension to Open Bus Interface (OBI) combining
triple modular redundancy (TMR) for critical handshake signals with error
correction codes (ECC) protection on other signals for complete reliability.
Implementing and testing a fully reliable crossbar shows improved reliability
to injected faults from a vulnerability of 34.85 % to 0 % compared to a
reference design, with an area increase of 2.6x and 1.4x timing impact. The
area overhead is 1.8x lower than that reported in the literature for
fine-grained triplication and voting.

TL;DR: The paper explores using frozen audio and language models to add speaker metadata to dialogue transcriptions without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving dialogue transcriptions by adding speaker attributes, like age, gender, and emotion, to enhance the interpretability of conversations.

Method: The approach integrates frozen audio models (e.g., Whisper, WavLM) with a frozen LLAMA language model, using lightweight connectors to infer speaker characteristics.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance in speaker profiling tasks and showcases LLAMA's capability to compare x-vectors with an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in certain cases.

Conclusion: The method enriches transcription pipelines while maintaining modularity, efficiency, and avoids model fine-tuning.

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Parity-aware BPE, a modified tokenization technique addressing inequalities in standard NLP tokenizers, particularly for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate and address the inequalities in tokenization for low-resource languages, which result in disproportionally longer sequences and computational disadvantages.

Method: Propose Parity-aware BPE, an algorithm that prioritizes compression for the worst-compressed language during token splitting, balancing cross-lingual compression while maintaining global efficiency.

Result: Parity-aware BPE achieves more balanced token counts across languages without significantly impacting overall compression or downstream NLP performance.

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE demonstrates potential for equitable tokenization in NLP systems, benefiting underrepresented languages while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of ASR systems using semi-supervised speech representation by incorporating prosodic cues like pitch accent.

Method: Developed a joint model combining ASR systems with a pitch accent detection module, leveraging the prosodic cues for improved accuracy.

Result: Improved pitch accent detection with a 41% F1-score gap closure and reduced ASR WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech under limited resources.

Conclusion: Incorporating pitch accent detection enhances ASR systems, highlighting the need to preserve or relearn prosodic features in speech models.

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that
use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary
pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the stability of personality-like traits in large language models (LLMs) using a new framework (PERSIST) and finds significant behavioral variability across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the stability and consistency of personality traits in large language models, especially critical for their safe deployment.

Method: Developed PERSIST, a framework testing over 25 open-source LLMs across 500,000 responses using traditional and LLM-specific instruments while analyzing the effect of prompts, question orders, and reasoning strategies.

Result: LLMs show substantial variability in personality trait expressions, even in high-parameter models. Adjustments like chain-of-thought reasoning or personas paradoxically increase variability, and measurement instability exists at both large and small scales.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack the behavioral consistency required for safety-critical tasks, and personality-based alignment strategies may be inadequate to achieve reliable performance.

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic routing framework called RCR-Router for efficient collaboration in multi-agent large language models (LLMs), reducing token usage by up to 30% while maintaining or improving answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies like excessive token consumption and limited adaptability in existing static or full-context routing methods for multi-agent LLM systems.

Method: RCR-Router uses a modular, role-aware, and dynamic memory routing framework with a lightweight scoring policy to select relevant memory for each agent based on role and task stage, adhering to a strict token budget. Shared memory stores iteratively refine context, and a new Answer Quality Score metric evaluates LLM-generated explanations.

Result: RCR-Router reduces token usage by up to 30% while maintaining or improving answer quality in multi-hop QA tests on HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop datasets.

Conclusion: Structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation are essential for scalable and efficient collaboration in multi-agent LLM systems, as exemplified by RCR-Router's performance.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents a benchmark to evaluate biases in LLMs related to linguistic patterns, especially those associated with demographic attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and quantify subtle biases in Large Language Models that arise from linguistic traits tied to demographic attributes like gender or regional background.

Method: They use 100 validated question-response pairs to create simulations that isolate linguistic traits while maintaining content equivalence. This measures bias in LLM evaluations.

Result: The study finds that hedged responses were penalized with 25.6% lower ratings on average. The benchmark also highlights biases specific to different LLMs.

Conclusion: The work offers a robust framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems, contributing to fairness in automated decision-making.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

TL;DR: The paper addresses inefficiencies in long-context modeling in LLMs by reformulating attention sparsity as a supervised learning task, enabling better token management and reduced computational costs through Dynamic Group Attention (DGA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational inefficiencies and redundancy in long-context modeling within large language models.

Method: The authors reformulated sequence modeling, analyzed attention sparsity, and proposed Dynamic Group Attention (DGA) which reduces computational costs by aggregating less important tokens.

Result: Dynamic Group Attention (DGA) reduces computational costs while achieving competitive performance in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dynamic Group Attention (DGA) offers a robust solution for enhancing efficiency and managing sparsity in transformer-based models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language
processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational
inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while
attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal}
computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional
probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task},
enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a
clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we
theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens
significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate
attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group
coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness
against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we
propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group
coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens
during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.Code is

### [43] [Towards Robust Evaluation of Visual Activity Recognition: Resolving Verb Ambiguity with Sense Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04945)
*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-language clustering framework to evaluate visual activity recognition systems more effectively, addressing issues in standard evaluation methods that fail to account for ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for visual activity recognition rely on exact-match criteria using a single gold answer, which do not account for ambiguities caused by synonymous verbs and varying perspectives.

Method: The authors introduce a vision-language clustering framework that generates verb sense clusters for images, capturing distinct semantic perspectives and enabling more robust evaluations.

Result: Analysis on the imSitu dataset shows that images map to 2.8 sense clusters on average, and evaluation using these clusters offers a nuanced understanding of model performance compared to standard methods.

Conclusion: Cluster-based evaluation aligns better with human judgments and provides a more comprehensive assessment of visual activity recognition models, helping to overcome limitations in traditional evaluation techniques.

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

### [44] [A Multi-Stage Large Language Model Framework for Extracting Suicide-Related Social Determinants of Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05003)
*Song Wang,Yishu Wei,Haotian Ma,Max Lovitt,Kelly Deng,Yuan Meng,Zihan Xu,Jingze Zhang,Yunyu Xiao,Ying Ding,Xuhai Xu,Joydeep Ghosh,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-stage large language model framework for extracting social determinants of health (SDoH) factors from unstructured text, specifically focused on suicide-related contexts. The approach improves accuracy, transparency, and efficiency compared to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide incidents are influenced by social determinants of health (SDoH), and understanding these factors can aid in early intervention and prevention. Current data-driven methods face challenges in factor distribution, identifying key stressors, and providing model explainability.

Method: The authors propose a multi-stage framework using large language models. They compared their approach to existing models (BioBERT, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-R1) and conducted automated evaluations as well as a pilot user study to assess performance and explainability in annotating SDoH factors.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art models in extracting SDoH factors and retrieving relevant context. Fine-tuning task-specific models led to comparable or improved performance with lower inference costs. The multi-stage design also added intermediate explanations, enhancing model transparency.

Conclusion: The framework improves extraction accuracy, explainability, and efficiency for suicide-related SDoH data. These advancements can support initiatives to identify at-risk individuals and develop better prevention strategies.

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

### [45] [Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction via Structural Entropy Minimization Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05023)
*Kun Peng,Cong Cao,Hao Peng,Zhifeng Hao,Lei Jiang,Kongjing Gu,Yanbing Liu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper tackles DiaASQ by dividing dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues using a structural entropy algorithm and then extracting sentiment element quadruples in a two-step process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume a uniform distribution of sentiment elements across entire dialogues, which introduces noise in the presence of independent sub-dialogues.

Method: Proposes dividing dialogues into sub-dialogues using a structural entropy minimization algorithm and employing a two-step framework for extraction: element-level extraction and sub-dialogue quadruple matching.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in DiaASQ with reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: Partitioning dialogues into independent units significantly improves DiaASQ extraction performance, balancing completeness with minimized computation.

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

### [46] [Evaluation of LLMs in AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05028)
*Shu Han Ho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of finetuning four distinct decoder-only LLMs for AMR parsing, achieving performance close to state-of-the-art parsers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether finetuning decoder-only LLMs can provide a simple yet effective approach for AMR parsing, competing with complex SOTA parsers.

Method: The authors finetuned four distinct LLM architectures (Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, DeepSeek R1) on the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test data, emphasizing straightforward methodology.

Result: The study achieved SMATCH F1 scores matching or nearing SOTA, with LLaMA 3.2 showing strong semantic performance and Phi 3.5 excelling in structural validity.

Conclusion: Straightforward finetuning of decoder-only LLMs can be a viable alternative for AMR parsing, with competitive performance and specific strengths.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence
meaning as rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, where nodes represent concepts and
edges denote semantic relations. Finetuning decoder only Large Language Models
(LLMs) represent a promising novel straightfoward direction for AMR parsing.
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of finetuning four distinct LLM
architectures, Phi 3.5, Gemma 2, LLaMA 3.2, and DeepSeek R1 LLaMA Distilled
using the LDC2020T02 Gold AMR3.0 test set. Our results have shown that
straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5
excels in structural validity.

### [47] [Align, Don't Divide: Revisiting the LoRA Architecture in Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05078)
*Jinda Liu,Bo Cheng,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the traditional multi-component paradigm in multi-task learning (MTL) for large language models (LLMs) and shows that simpler approaches like a single-adapter LoRA or Align-LoRA are sufficient for competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the process of adapting LLMs to handle multiple diverse tasks by questioning the current reliance on complex multi-adapter or multi-head architectures.

Method: The authors propose Align-LoRA, which aligns task representations within the shared adapter space using an explicit alignment loss, as an alternative to structurally complex systems.

Result: Experiments show that Align-LoRA significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines in MTL, supporting the hypothesis.

Conclusion: Simpler architectures like Align-LoRA lead to better MTL generalization by focusing on learning robust shared representations instead of isolating task-specific features, thus simplifying the paradigm of adapting LLMs for MTL.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

### [48] [Multimodal Fact Checking with Unified Visual, Textual, and Contextual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05097)
*Aditya Kishore,Gaurav Kumar,Jasabanta Patro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "MultiCheck," a unified framework for multimodal fact-checking that combines textual and visual cues to verify claim veracity. It achieves significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in multimodal misinformation makes it difficult for fact-checking systems, which commonly rely on text alone, to effectively verify claims.

Method: The MultiCheck framework incorporates dedicated text and image encoders, a fusion module for capturing cross-modal relationships, and a classification head driven by contrastive learning for claim-veracity prediction.

Result: MultiCheck achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.84 on the Factify 2 dataset, outperforming baseline systems.

Conclusion: Explicit multimodal reasoning proves effective, and the approach offers scalable, interpretable solutions for real-world fact-checking challenges.

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [49] [BEE-RAG: Balanced Entropy Engineering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05100)
*Yuhao Wang,Ruiyang Ren,Yucheng Wang,Jing Liu,Wayne Xin Zhao,Hua Wu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BEE-RAG, a framework addressing limitations in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by managing context entropy to improve performance with long retrieval contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by large context lengths in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), including unconstrained entropy growth and diluted attention, which limit the system's performance.

Method: The authors propose BEE-RAG, a framework based on entropy invariance principles. It balances context entropy to reformulate attention dynamics, decoupling attention sensitivity from context length. This involves zero-shot inference for multi-importance estimation and an adaptive fine-tuning mechanism.

Result: Experiments across various RAG tasks show that BEE-RAG improves adaptability to varying context lengths, enhancing RAG's performance.

Conclusion: BEE-RAG provides a robust approach to optimize retrieval-augmented generation systems, demonstrating the benefit of entropy-focused engineering in handling varying retrieval contexts.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we
introduce a zero-shot inference strategy for multi-importance estimation and a
parameter-efficient adaptive fine-tuning mechanism to obtain the optimal
balancing factor for different settings. Extensive experiments across multiple
RAG tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BEE-RAG.

### [50] [Attention Basin: Why Contextual Position Matters in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05128)
*Zihao Yi,Delong Zeng,Zhenqing Ling,Haohao Luo,Zhe Xu,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Wanxia Cao,Ying Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit a positional bias by favoring the start and end of sequences, often ignoring the middle. A new method called AttnRank reorders input to maximize performance based on this behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand why LLMs perform differently based on input position and to address this bias, as it's crucial for tasks like multi-hop QA and few-shot learning.

Method: The authors identify the 'attention basin' phenomenon where LLMs favor specific positions. They propose AttnRank—a model-agnostic framework that estimates attention preferences and reorders the input sequence to align critical information with high-attention zones.

Result: AttnRank demonstrated notable performance improvements across 10 different LLMs on tasks like multi-hop QA and few-shot learning, without altering the models or requiring training.

Conclusion: The study introduces the 'attention basin' as a key insight into LLM positional bias and offers AttnRank as a practical, efficient solution to enhance model performance without intensive resources.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

*Chang Hong,Minghao Wu,Qingying Xiao,Yuchi Wang,Xiang Wan,Guangjun Yu,Benyou Wang,Yan Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrinciplismQA, a benchmark for assessing the ethical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare based on core medical ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to systematically evaluate the ethical reasoning of LLMs in healthcare, as current benchmarks largely ignore this crucial aspect.

Method: The PrinciplismQA benchmark includes 3,648 questions grounded in Principlism and comprises multiple-choice and open-ended questions validated by medical experts.

Result: Experiments revealed LLMs' struggles with applying ethical principles dynamically, especially with Beneficence, and noted that fine-tuning in the medical domain enhances model performance.

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA is a scalable tool to diagnose ethical reasoning weaknesses in LLMs, enabling the development of more ethically aligned and responsible medical AI.

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

### [53] [Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment Reasoning and Classification via Chain-of-Thought Enhancement and Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05234)
*Haonan Shangguan,Xiaocui Yang,Shi Feng,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang,Ge Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: With the increase in multimodal content and large language models (LLMs), this paper introduces a lightweight approach for multimodal sentiment reasoning and classification (JMSRC) suitable for resource-limited environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely heavily on large, parameter-heavy LLMs, which are often unsuitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings. There is a need for efficient models that can perform sentiment reasoning and classification autonomously in such environments.

Method: The authors propose MulCoT-RD, a model operating under a 'Teacher-Assistant-Student' distillation paradigm. It starts with a high-performing MLLM generating a reasoning dataset. A medium assistant model then uses multi-task learning to distill knowledge into a lighter student model capable of reasoning and sentiment classification.

Result: Experiments conducted on four datasets show that the lightweight MulCoT-RD model, with just 3 billion parameters, achieves robust performance in sentiment reasoning and classification tasks. It demonstrates strong generalization and better interpretability.

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD provides an effective solution for multimodal sentiment analysis in resource-constrained environments, maintaining high performance with minimal model size while addressing interpretability concerns.

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

*Yiheng Liu,Junhao Ning,Sichen Xia,Xiaohui Gao,Ning Qiang,Bao Ge,Junwei Han,Xintao Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel pruning approach for large language models (LLMs) by preserving their functional networks to maintain efficiency and functionality, overcoming issues with traditional pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address pruning challenges in large language models, especially the degradation of functionality caused by ignoring neuron interactions and collaboration during pruning.

Method: The authors treat an LLM as a digital brain and decompose it into functional networks, preserving key neurons in these networks for pruning. Inspired by neuroimaging concepts, they leverage functional similarities between artificial neural networks and the human brain.

Result: The proposed method successfully identifies functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, resulting in efficient model pruning and improved performance compared to traditional pruning techniques.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical and efficient solution for compressing LLMs, ensuring reduced GPU memory consumption and faster inference speeds by preserving essential functionalities.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

*Sijie Wang,Quanjiang Guo,Kai Zhao,Yawei Zhang,Xin Li,Xiang Li,Siqi Li,Rui She,Shangshu Yu,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeBoost, a training framework for code large language models (LLMs) that improves performance purely using code snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of instruction-based post-training in code LLMs caused by the difficulty and labor-intensive nature of collecting high-quality coding instructions, despite the abundance of code snippets.

Method: CodeBoost uses five key components: (1) maximum-clique curation for selecting a diverse training corpus, (2) bi-directional prediction to enable learning from both forward and backward predictions, (3) error-aware prediction leveraging correct and incorrect outputs, (4) heterogeneous augmentation to vary training distribution, and (5) heterogeneous rewarding using multiple reward metrics including format correctness and execution feedback.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeBoost consistently improves the performance of various code LLMs across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: CodeBoost is a scalable and effective post-training framework that significantly enhances the capabilities of code LLMs using readily available code snippets.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

### [56] [ASCoT: An Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought Method for Late-Stage Fragility in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05282)
*Dongxu Zhang,Ning Yang,Jihua Zhu,Jinnan Yang,Miao Xin,Baoliang Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Advanced the reasoning abilities of LLMs with CoT prompting, but late-stage errors are most detrimental. Proposed ASCoT to mitigate errors late in reasoning steps, with accuracy improving over benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the reliability and accuracy of reasoning chains in Large Language Models, addressing the critical challenge of 'Late-Stage Fragility,' where errors late in the reasoning chain disproportionately affect outcomes.

Method: ASCoT employs an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) to prioritize late-stage steps using a Positional Impact Score function, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE) for targeted correction of identified failure points.

Result: ASCoT significantly outperformed standard Chain-of-Thought methods on benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH, demonstrating strong accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: Identifying and addressing specific failure points in LLM reasoning chains, particularly late-stage fragility, greatly enhances accuracy, advocating for adaptive correction over uniform strategies.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper explores creating dialogue agents to assist meta-reviewers during the decision-making process by using synthetic data produced by Large Language Models (LLMs). This data leads to better-trained assistants that outperform general LLM solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-reviewing not only involves summarization of review reports but requires careful decision-making by considering and contextualizing reviewer arguments. Assisting this process effectively is important to enhance efficiency.

Method: Synthetic dialogue data tailored to expert domains is generated using Large Language Models (LLMs) with a self-refinement strategy. This data is then used to train dialogue agents specifically designed for meta-reviewing tasks.

Result: Dialogue agents trained using synthetic refined data outperform off-the-shelf LLM-based assistants in the meta-reviewing process. Applying these agents in real-world scenarios shows their practical effectiveness in improving meta-review efficiency.

Conclusion: Employing tailored dialogue agents trained with high-quality synthetic data can significantly improve the meta-reviewing process, highlighting their utility for decision-making tasks in expert domains.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SONAR-LLM is a decoder-only transformer model that combines continuous embedding with token-level cross-entropy for improved text generation. It avoids the diffusion sampler and uses likelihood-based training for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve text generation by combining the semantic abstraction of LCM with efficient likelihood-based training without relying on diffusion samplers.

Method: SONAR-LLM employs a hybrid training approach using the SONAR embedding space with token-level cross-entropy supervised via a frozen decoder from SONAR.

Result: SONAR-LLM demonstrates competitive generation quality across model sizes between 39M and 1.3B parameters, accompanied by scaling trends, benchmark results, and thorough ablations.

Conclusion: The study proves the effectiveness of SONAR-LLM by releasing comprehensive training code and pretrained checkpoints, fostering reproducibility and further research in continuous embedding-based text generation models.

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

### [59] [Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05337)
*Jiameng Huang,Baijiong Lin,Guhao Feng,Jierun Chen,Di He,Lu Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS) to reduce the overthinking issue in Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) while maintaining reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overthinking problem in LRLMs where redundant reflection cycles increase token usage, inference costs, and reduce practical utility.

Method: CGRS suppresses reflection behaviors dynamically based on model confidence during the response generation without retraining or architectural changes.

Result: The method reduces token usage by 18.5% to 41.9% while maintaining reasoning accuracy across benchmarks and is consistent across different model architectures and scales.

Conclusion: CGRS provides a practical solution for efficient reasoning in LRLMs, striking a balance between performance and token length reduction.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

*Fenya Wasserroth,Eleftherios Avramidis,Vera Czehmann,Tanja Kojic,Fabrizio Nunnari,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzed the impact of adjustable sign language avatars on Microsoft Hololens 2, finding limited improvement in user experience and comprehensibility despite user preference for adjustability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to explore how adjustment features in sign language avatars could enhance interaction quality, comprehensibility, and user experience for expert German Sign Language users.

Method: Expert German Sign Language users interacted with adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a controlled use case to analyze factors influencing comprehensibility, UX, and acceptability.

Result: Despite preference for adjustable avatars, there were no significant UX or comprehensibility improvements due to missing elements (like facial expressions), poor implementation, and high stress levels.

Conclusion: Personalization alone is inadequate for effective SL avatars. Default comprehensibility, better mouthing, facial animation, interaction interfaces, and participatory design are recommended.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs), through iterative self-feedback, can improve output in specialized professional search tasks like biomedical research, using the BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge as a study framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in applying autonomous search systems like agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to domain-specific tasks, emphasizing transparency and alignment with expert needs in fields like biomedical research.

Method: The study tested reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs (Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1) using self-feedback mechanisms to iteratively refine outputs across various answer types (yes/no, factoid, list, ideal).

Result: Preliminary results reveal mixed performance of the self-feedback strategy across different models and tasks, highlighting areas for improvement.

Conclusion: The research identifies strengths and limitations of LLM self-correction strategies and suggests further exploration into comparing LLM-generated feedback against expert human inputs in professional search tasks.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MyCulture, a benchmark focusing on Malaysian cultural evaluation for LLMs, emphasizing inclusivity and fairness in cultural representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cultural and language biases in LLMs, particularly for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu, and improve their evaluation in diverse contexts.

Method: The authors developed MyCulture, a benchmark with open-ended multiple-choice questions covering six Malaysian cultural pillars to test fairness and performance. They also analyzed structural and language biases via multilingual prompts.

Result: Evaluations across regional and international LLMs showed significant disparities in understanding Malaysian culture, showcasing limitations in current LLMs.

Conclusion: The study underscores the critical need for culturally aware and linguistically inclusive benchmarks to enhance LLM development and assessments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs rely on static benchmarks that suffer from data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, preventing accurate assessment of true model capabilities.

Method: A dynamic evaluation framework called LLMEval-3 is introduced, featuring a proprietary bank of unseen test questions, anti-cheating mechanisms, and calibrated LLM judging with high agreement rates with human experts.

Result: A 20-month study applying LLMEval-3 to nearly 50 LLMs revealed a ceiling in knowledge memorization and detected contamination vulnerabilities missed by static benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMEval-3 proves robust in delivering consistent and stable rankings, proposing a reliable approach for evaluating LLMs and setting a new standard for trustworthy evaluations.

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

TL;DR: This study introduces TASE, a benchmark to assess LLMs' token-level reasoning capabilities and evaluates the performance of over 30 leading models, revealing significant weaknesses compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models excel in semantic tasks but often fail in precise, token-level reasoning and structural understanding, which are crucial for applications requiring control and accuracy.

Method: The authors developed TASE, a benchmark covering 10 token awareness and structural understanding tasks across multiple languages, along with a synthetic data pipeline for training. They evaluated over 30 LLMs and trained a custom Qwen2.5-14B model using GRPO.

Result: The study found that human performance surpasses state-of-the-art LLMs in token-level reasoning, indicating notable weaknesses in these models.

Conclusion: TASE highlights the persistent token-level reasoning limitations in LLMs and offers a diagnostic tool for advancing low-level language understanding and cross-lingual capabilities.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the consistency and relevance of creativity evaluation metrics in reflecting human judgments of creativity.

Method: The authors analyze creativity metrics such as creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and Large Language Model-as-a-Judge (LLM-as-a-Judge) across creative writing, problem-solving, and ideation domains.

Result: Different creativity metrics exhibit limited consistency and capture varying aspects of creativity, but each has distinct limitations such as instability, biases, and lack of conceptual alignment.

Conclusion: There is a need for more robust and generalizable evaluation frameworks that better correlate with human creativity judgments across tasks and domains.

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG), a method that improves reasoning and reduces hallucinations in large language models by systematically decomposing and solving complex questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks, specifically their tendency to generate hallucinations when dealing with complex reasoning.

Method: The proposed LAG paradigm systematically decomposes complex questions into simpler sub-questions based on logical dependencies. It sequentially resolves these sub-questions using prior answers for guiding retrieval and employs a termination mechanism to halt progress on unanswerable nodes, synthesizing final responses from resolved components.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets reveal that LAG significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucinations, and better aligns LLM's reasoning process with human cognition compared to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Conclusion: LAG represents a paradigm shift in knowledge augmentation for LLMs by incorporating logical structuring and stepwise reasoning, offering an effective and human-aligned alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers used a 20 Questions game to uncover geographic and cultural biases in Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding persistent implicit biases in LLMs despite explicit tuning efforts.

Method: Systematic evaluation using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, under different gameplay configurations.

Result: LLMs perform better on entities from Global North and West compared to Global South and East.

Conclusion: Subtle biases in LLMs can be revealed via proactive multi-turn reasoning frameworks rather than standard prompting approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'CoCoLex', a decoding strategy that enhances fidelity to source context in legal text generation by combining the model's vocabulary distribution with a copy-based distribution guided by confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in faithfully processing legal texts due to issues like hallucinations and lack of grounding in contexts.

Method: The CoCoLex approach interpolates between the model's generated vocabulary distribution and a copy-based distribution derived from the context, with guidance from the model's confidence levels.

Result: CoCoLex demonstrated superior performance in legal text generation across five benchmarks, especially excelling in long-form generation tasks.

Conclusion: CoCoLex improves the faithfulness and context grounding of LLMs' legal text generation, surpassing prior context-aware decoding methods.

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a frequency-based uncertainty quantification method using conformal prediction for large language models (LLMs) in multiple-choice question answering, ensuring reliable performance with provable guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in MCQA tasks but face challenges like hallucination and overconfidence, which limit their use in critical areas.

Method: The authors propose a black-box method by leveraging sampling frequency to compute predictive entropy using conformal prediction, assessing its ability to distinguish correct/incorrect predictions based on samples.

Result: The method surpasses logit-based predictive entropy in AUROC performance and effectively controls miscoverage rates across six LLMs and four datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed technique offers a model-agnostic, distribution-free framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in LLM-based MCQA, boosting their credibility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

*Franziska Weeber,Tanise Ceron,Sebastian Padó*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines cross-lingual political opinions in multilingual large language models (MLLMs), finding minimal differences pre-alignment and uniform shifts across languages post-alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if multilingual large language models exhibit separate political opinions for different languages or if opinions transfer across languages.

Method: The authors used political statements from voting advice applications to measure MLLMs' opinions, and tested models before and after alignment via direct preference optimization using English-language data.

Result: Unaligned models showed few significant cross-lingual disparities in political opinions, and alignment caused uniform shifts in political perspectives across all languages tested.

Conclusion: Political opinions in MLLMs transfer between Western languages, posing challenges for achieving socio-linguistic and cultural alignment in these models.

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

### [72] [MathSmith: Towards Extremely Hard Mathematical Reasoning by Forging Synthetic Problems with a Reinforced Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05592)
*Shaoxiong Zhan,Yanlin Lai,Ziyu Lu,Dahua Lin,Ziqing Yang,Fei Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MathSmith is a framework to improve mathematical reasoning in large language models by creating high-difficulty synthetic problems using reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of diverse, high-quality, and high-difficulty mathematical training data limits the reasoning capability of large language models.

Method: MathSmith constructs challenging mathematical problems by sampling concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, employs nine strategies as constraints, uses reinforcement learning to optimize validity and complexity, and leverages reasoning trace lengths for cognitive complexity.

Result: MathSmith outperformed existing baselines on benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, OlympiadBench), showcasing efficacy in both short and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) settings and better targeted concept improvement.

Conclusion: MathSmith demonstrates scalability, generalization, and transferability in synthesizing high-difficulty problems, proving the value of synthetic data in advancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

### [73] [Cooper: Co-Optimizing Policy and Reward Models in Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05613)
*Haitao Hong,Yuchen Yan,Xingyu Wu,Guiyang Hou,Wenqi Zhang,Weiming Lu,Yongliang Shen,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cooper, an RL framework that co-optimizes the policy and reward models for large language models, mitigating limitations of rule-based and model-based rewards, and enhancing overall RL performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate and address the limitations of existing reward paradigms for reinforcement learning in LLMs, namely the lack of robustness in rule-based rewards and vulnerability to reward hacking in model-based rewards.

Method: They propose Cooper, which jointly optimizes the policy and reward models and constructs dynamically selected positive-negative sample pairs for training. Additionally, they introduce a hybrid annotation strategy and a reference-based reward modeling paradigm, training a reward model called VerifyRM.

Result: The Cooper framework alleviates reward hacking, improves robustness, and enhances RL performance, achieving a 0.54% gain in average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. VerifyRM outperformed other models of the same size on VerifyBench.

Conclusion: Dynamically updating the reward model enhances reinforcement learning performance and robustness, providing insights for better integrating reward models into RL, thereby mitigating reward hacking issues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

*Zixuan Wang,Dingming Li,Hongxing Li,Shuo Chen,Yuchen Yan,Wenqi Zhang,Yongliang Shen,Weiming Lu,Jun Xiao,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniEAR, a framework to evaluate how language models perform in embodied reasoning tasks like tool usage and multi-agent coordination under dynamic conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the largely unexplored area of how language models reason about physical interactions and embodied tasks such as tool usage and multi-agent collaboration.

Method: Develop OmniEAR as a benchmark, modeling physical and spatial constraints across 1,500 scenarios. Evaluate language models on their ability to reason dynamically without explicit predefined instructions.

Result: Performance drops dramatically when models must reason with constraints: success rates drop from 85-96% to as low as 56%. Fine-tuning improves single-agent task success significantly (from 0.6% to 76.3%) but minimally impacts multi-agent tasks.

Conclusion: Current language models face fundamental limitations in embodied reasoning tasks. OmniEAR serves as a rigorous benchmark to evaluate and improve embodied AI reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

### [75] [Learning to Reason for Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05618)
*Xilun Chen,Ilia Kulikov,Vincent-Pierre Berges,Barlas Oğuz,Rulin Shao,Gargi Ghosh,Jason Weston,Wen-tau Yih*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) for long-form factual tasks by proposing a multi-dimensional reward function for effective reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: R-LLMs excel at complex reasoning tasks but are prone to hallucinations, especially in long-form factuality benchmarks. The paper aims to overcome verification challenges with existing RL methods in this context.

Method: The authors designed a novel reward function that evaluates factual precision, detail, and relevance, and applied online reinforcement learning to improve R-LLM performance.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated a 23.1% reduction in hallucinations, a 23% increase in the detail of responses, and preserved overall helpfulness across six factual benchmarks.

Conclusion: This innovative reward design significantly enhances factual reasoning in R-LLMs, paving the way for more effective and reliable models in long-form tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

*Brandon Jaipersaud,David Krueger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper employs linear probes to study persuasion in multi-turn conversations involving LLMs, demonstrating their efficiency and accuracy compared to prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how persuasion dynamics function in conversations with LLMs, leveraging cognitive science for insights.

Method: Linear probes were trained to assess three persuasion aspects: success, persuadee personality, and strategy, applied to multi-turn conversations.

Result: Probes effectively identify persuasion moments, outperform prompting in analyzing strategies, and are computationally faster.

Conclusion: Linear probes are promising tools for studying complex behaviors like persuasion, deception, and manipulation in LLM interactions, highlighting their efficiency for large datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model for byte-level language modeling in morphologically-rich languages. It achieves state-of-the-art results for Persian language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational inefficiencies and linguistic challenges faced by byte-level language models, especially in morphologically-rich languages, while eliminating the need for fragile tokenizers.

Method: The authors propose H-NET++, a model leveraging hierarchical dynamic chunking and innovations such as a lightweight Transformer for cross-chunk attention, latent hyper-prior for document-level consistency, orthographic artifact handling, and curriculum-based training with staged sequence lengths.

Result: H-NET++ achieved remarkable results, including: 12% better compression rates compared to BPE-based models, a 5.4 percentage point gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to orthographic corruption (e.g., ZWNJ), and 73.8% F1 accuracy on gold morphological boundaries.

Conclusion: Hierarchical dynamic chunking as introduced in H-NET++ is an effective tokenizer-free approach for morphologically-rich languages, aligning well with morphology and demonstrating computational efficiency and linguistic consistency.

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents RetinexDual, a novel framework combining spatial and frequency domain methods for Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UHD IR methods face challenges like irreversible information loss in downsampling and inefficiency of frequency-domain methods for spatially confined artifacts.

Method: The RetinexDual framework employs two sub-networks: SAMBA, for reflectance correction using a coarse-to-fine mechanism, and FIA, for addressing color and illumination corrections via frequency-domain analysis.

Result: RetinexDual outperforms recent methods in UHD IR tasks such as deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and low-light image enhancement, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: RetinexDual addresses UHD IR challenges effectively by integrating task-specific designs, demonstrating the significance of combining spatial and frequency domain analyses.

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

TL;DR: The paper presents ENTRep, a benchmark for endoscopic image analysis, enabling fine-grained classification and bilingual image/text retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing challenges in automated ENT endoscopic image analysis arise from variability in devices, subtle localized findings, and fine-grained distinctions, requiring improved classification and reliable retrieval systems.

Method: The ENTRep benchmark integrates anatomical classification with image and text retrieval using a dataset of expert-annotated bilingual descriptions, standardizing submission and scoring protocols.

Result: ENTRep evaluates performance through benchmark tasks, showcases top teams' results, and offers insights into ENT endoscopy analysis challenges.

Conclusion: ENTRep provides a robust framework to advance ENT endoscopy analysis, integrating classification and retrieval tasks with bilingual support.

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduced CoMAD, a framework that unifies outputs from multiple self-supervised vision transformers into a compact model, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being resource-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning approaches typically train models in isolation, resulting in large, impractical models for resource-constrained applications. The authors aim to unify knowledge from multiple models to create compact and efficient representations.

Method: The CoMAD framework combines multiple pretrained Vision Transformer models using asymmetric masking, teacher embedding alignment, and consensus gating techniques. It trains a student model with dual-level KL divergence.

Result: CoMAD's compact ViT-Tiny model achieved state-of-the-art performance, improving Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and metrics for dense-prediction tasks on ADE20K and MS-COCO datasets.

Conclusion: CoMAD demonstrates the potential to unify diverse self-supervised learning paradigms into more efficient and powerful models, suitable for resource-constrained scenarios while establishing new benchmarks in compact SSL distillation.

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces RADAR, a novel real-time anomaly detection method utilizing attention-based diffusion models, outperforming existing models in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods, such as high computational cost, inaccuracies for subtle or complex anomalies, and dependency on prior knowledge.

Method: RADAR avoids the reconstruction process of traditional diffusion models and directly generates anomaly maps using attention-based diffusion models, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Result: RADAR achieved superior performance on the MVTec-AD and 3D-printed material datasets, with significant improvements in key metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

Conclusion: RADAR sets a new benchmark for real-time unsupervised anomaly detection, proving both more efficient and effective than current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

TL;DR: The paper develops a cost-effective deep learning algorithm using event cameras to track eye movements with applications in VR/AR and achieves 81% accuracy using a CNN_LSTM model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise and interpretable eye movement tracking is needed for enhancing comfort and user experience in VR and AR devices.

Method: The researchers employed deep learning techniques, specifically a CNN_LSTM model, to predict eye center positions using data from event cameras.

Result: The CNN_LSTM model demonstrated 81% accuracy in eye movement tracking.

Conclusion: Future work will utilize Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to increase model interpretability and predictive performance.

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN integrates discrete wavelet transforms and Lucas polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for accurate and computationally efficient 3D human motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches to forecast human motion often struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency, necessitating novel architectures for improved outcomes.

Method: LuKAN utilizes discrete wavelet transforms for encoding temporal information, spatial projection layers for structural consistency, and Lucas polynomial-parameterized KANs for oscillatory motion handling.

Result: LuKAN shows competitive performance on multiple benchmark datasets, offering strong accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing models.

Conclusion: LuKAN demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in 3D human motion prediction through its innovative integration of Lucas polynomial activations and wavelet transforms.

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VER-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs' capabilities in extracting fine-grained visual clues and performing complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately evaluate subtle, intricate reasoning and visual understanding, which is essential for robust MLLM evaluation.

Method: VER-Bench is designed with 374 questions focusing on Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System State, and Symbolic reasoning, each evaluated with structured evidence from fine-grained visual clues.

Result: VER-Bench demonstrates limitations in current models' abilities to interpret subtle visual evidence and build complex, evidence-based arguments.

Conclusion: Enhancing fine-grained evidence extraction and reasoning in MLLMs is essential for achieving genuine visual understanding and human-like visual analysis.

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of traditional diffusion models that require exclusively normal data for training, thus enhancing their applicability in realistic scenarios where training data often contains anomalies.

Method: The authors reinterpret denoising diffusion models via robust regression within a nonlinear regression framework, allowing for anomaly segmentation using contaminated, unlabeled data.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in anomaly segmentation on the MVTec dataset, achieving up to 8.08% higher AUROC and 10.37% higher AUPRC compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study confirms that robust denoising diffusion models are effective and versatile for unsupervised anomaly segmentation in contaminated datasets, opening new avenues for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAMM, a new framework for transformer-based object detectors, addressing issues like occlusion and inefficiency with novel multi-modal queries and a dual-stream attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based object detectors face challenges such as handling occlusions, achieving fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiencies due to fixed queries and dense attention.

Method: DAMM uses multi-modal queries (appearance-based, positional, and random learned queries) and a dual-stream cross-attention mechanism for semantic and spatial feature refinement.

Result: DAMM outperformed existing methods in accuracy and recall across four benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal query adaptation and dual-stream attention enhance object detection, making DAMM both more accurate and efficient. Source code has been made available for public use.

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [87] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)
*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Rahul Singh,Jiangbei Yue,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the limitations of coarse video-level annotations in identifying hateful content in multimodal videos, emphasizing the importance of fine-grained, temporally-aware approaches for improved classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the label noise and ambiguity caused by coarse video-level annotations in detecting hateful content in multimedia. This is critical as hateful segments within videos can be fleeting but impactful, necessitating a granular temporal analysis.

Method: The authors isolate explicitly hateful segments from existing datasets using annotated timestamps, perform exploratory analysis to examine the content distribution, and conduct controlled experiments to assess the effect of label noise on model performance.

Result: The study reveals that coarse annotations cause confusion in model decision-making, leading to weakened classification confidence and reduced robustness.

Conclusion: Highlighting the temporal dynamics of hateful content, the paper advocates for temporally-aware models and benchmarks to enhance interpretability and robustness in multimodal hateful video detection.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [88] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA is a test-time adaptation framework that dynamically adjusts video highlight detection models, leading to better performance compared to fixed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video highlight detection models are non-adaptive and fail to consider the unique characteristics of individual test videos, resulting in suboptimal performance.

Method: The proposed Highlight-TTA framework dynamically adapts models during testing by optimizing them for each test video. It uses an auxiliary cross-modality hallucination task and a meta-auxiliary training scheme to boost performance.

Result: Highlight-TTA significantly improves the performance of three state-of-the-art highlight detection models across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Flexible, dynamic adaptation during testing enhances video highlight detection models and achieves superior results compared to static approaches.

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [89] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to adapt foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs) trained on perspective images to fisheye images, using lightweight Calibration Tokens. The method avoids retraining or finetuning and improves accuracy in depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the issue of covariate shift in FMDEs caused by changes in camera calibration parameters (e.g., intrinsic, distortion) when applied from perspective to fisheye images.

Method: The approach utilizes Calibration Tokens to modulate latent embeddings from fisheye images, aligning them with perspective image embeddings. The method is self-supervised, recalibrates perspective image datasets to fisheye images, and ensures consistency between depth estimates during training.

Result: The method achieved improved depth estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods when tested on both indoor and outdoor datasets, using multiple FMDEs with a single set of tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight self-supervised adaptation mechanism enables FMDEs to handle fisheye images without requiring additional retraining, while effectively improving depth estimation performance.

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

Motivation: To improve accuracy in image classification tasks using a novel method on a standard dataset.

Method: The authors trained a feedforward artificial neural network with 322 million parameters using a specific new method on the ImageNet dataset.

Result: The network achieved 98.3% accuracy, a 99.69% Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 perfectly classified labels per dataset partition.

Conclusion: The authors suggest that double-labeling issues in the dataset may prevent the model from achieving 100% accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM is a plug-and-play framework for vision-language models that improves generalization by using masked image modeling to create robust prompts, avoiding overfitting while adding minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models, despite excelling in zero-shot learning, face challenges in adapting to new tasks efficiently without extensive resource consumption. Prompt learning methods aim to address this but often overfit to seen categories, hampering generalization to unseen ones.

Method: ProMIM introduces masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM pipelines, where only visible image patches are masked to generate instance-conditioned prompts. This modular approach enhances existing methods like CoOp and CoCoOp without altering their core designs.

Result: ProMIM demonstrates consistent improvements in generalization on zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, enhancing the performance of existing prompt-learning frameworks with marginal computational overhead.

Conclusion: ProMIM provides a practical and lightweight method to enhance vision-language models for real-world applications, effectively reducing overfitting and improving robustness in generalization tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for weakly supervised dynamic scene graph generation (WS-DSGG) to overcome limitations of external object detectors when applied to dynamic, relation-aware scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by using external object detectors in WS-DSGG, including inaccurate localization and low-confidence object proposals.

Method: The proposed TRKT method consists of two key components: relation-aware knowledge mining (using attention maps and optical flow) and a Dual-stream Fusion Module to refine detection results from external detectors.

Result: TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Action Genome dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving object detection and relation prediction in videos.

Conclusion: TRKT significantly enhances weakly supervised DSGG by addressing dynamic and relation-aware challenges, providing better localization and high-confidence proposals, and affirming its robustness in video scene graph generation.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

*Stella Su,Marc Harary,Scott J. Rodig,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvDINO is a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework applied to overcome domain-specific biases, particularly in biomedical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of domain shift and batch effects in biomedical imaging, particularly in self-supervised learning methods.

Method: AdvDINO integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to achieve domain-invariant feature learning, demonstrated on multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images.

Result: AdvDINO reduced slide-specific biases, uncovered biologically meaningful phenotypes, improved survival prediction, and showed prognostic relevance in non-small cell lung cancer patients.

Conclusion: AdvDINO framework is robust for handling domain shift and has applications beyond biomedical imaging, benefiting fields like radiology and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

*Peng Zhang,Songru Yang,Jinsheng Sun,Weiqing Li,Zhiyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HOW-Seg, a framework for open-world point cloud segmentation, which uses human-in-the-loop prototypes and sparse annotations for effective segmentation of both known and novel classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in existing point cloud segmentation methods, which heavily rely on resource-intensive learning or densely annotated data, reducing their practicality in real-world scenarios.

Method: HOW-Seg employs a human-in-the-loop framework, using sparse annotations to construct and refine class prototypes on query data. It includes a hierarchical prototype disambiguation mechanism and applies a dense CRF to enhance segmentation accuracy iteratively with human feedback.

Result: Experiments show HOW-Seg achieving high segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing methods, such as GFS-Seg, under sparse and dense annotation conditions, with mIoU scores of 85.27% on S3DIS and 66.37% on ScanNetv2.

Conclusion: The proposed HOW-Seg framework demonstrates notable improvements in segmentation results using fewer annotations, potentially making it a more practical solution for real-world open-world segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for novel view synthesis (NVS) by introducing adaptive weighting using learned uncertainties, substantially addressing issues like overfitting in sparse-view scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to tackle the overfitting issue in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods, particularly in sparse-view novel view synthesis, by investigating adaptive Gaussian weighting through learned uncertainties.

Method: The method introduces learned uncertainties into the 3DGS pipeline, which adjust Gaussian weights during rendering. These uncertainties guide the opacity updates and undergo soft differentiable dropout regularization to transform uncertainties into drop probabilities, refining projection and blending.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing sparse-view 3DGS methods, including DropGaussian, by achieving up to 3.27% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset and reducing the number of Gausians needed for high-quality reconstructions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that adaptive Gaussian weighting via learned uncertainties effectively enhances rendering quality and efficiency in sparse-view scenarios for 3DGS, providing superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

TL;DR: This paper enhances a real-time perception approach for edge platforms using variable-sized and rate-selectable canvas frames, improving object detection quality under strict computational and latency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently perform high-resolution object detection under latency and resource constraints on edge platforms, and to address limitations of prior canvas-based approaches.

Method: The proposed method improves canvas-based attention scheduling by introducing variable canvas frame sizes and adjustable frame rates, evaluated using YOLOv11 on edge devices.

Result: Performance analysis on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrates improved quality/cost trade-offs with higher mAP and recall compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed solution successfully enhances real-time perception capabilities by optimizing resource use while maintaining high object detection accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

*Zheng Chen,Mingde Zhou,Jinpei Guo,Jiale Yuan,Yifei Ji,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SODEC is a single-step diffusion model for image compression, overcoming latency and fidelity issues in multi-step sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues of excessive decoding latency and poor fidelity in diffusion-based image compression methods.

Method: SODEC utilizes pre-trained VAE-based latents for rich information and replaces iterative denoising with single-step decoding, along with fidelity guidance and rate annealing strategies.

Result: SODEC outperforms existing methods in rate-distortion-perception metrics and achieves over 20x faster decoding speeds.

Conclusion: SODEC provides a significant advancement in image compression, improving both perceptual quality and processing efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

TL;DR: This paper presents a robust depth completion framework leveraging depth foundation models without requiring large-scale training. It excels in handling out-of-distribution scenarios by propagating sparse depth information effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely on limited data, leading to poor performance in out-of-distribution scenarios for depth completion.

Method: The authors propose a framework using depth foundation models to guide sparse depth propagation in 3D and 2D spaces, combined with a learnable correction module for refining intricate structures. The approach involves minimal training and utilizes the structural and semantic cues from foundation models.

Result: The framework demonstrates superior performance on NYUv2 and KITTI datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results across evaluations on 16 other diverse datasets, particularly excelling in OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances robustness in depth completion tasks through innovative propagation and correction methods, setting a new benchmark for handling OOD challenges.

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

*Xinyao Li,Jingjing Li,Zhekai Du,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of using vision-language models (VLMs) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with a novel methodology to bridge the modality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised domain adaptation enables models to generalize from labeled source domains to new, unlabeled domains. While vision-language models excel in zero-shot tasks, their modality gap hinders optimal performance.

Method: The proposed framework separates VLM-derived features into modality-specific and modality-invariant components. A modality discrepancy metric categorizes samples, enabling alignment and annotation via prompt tuning.

Result: The method achieves up to 9% increase in performance and 9x computational efficiency compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully addresses modality gaps in UDA, boosting cross-modal alignment and enhancing model adaptability across diverse settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

### [100] [Modeling Rapid Contextual Learning in the Visual Cortex with Fast-Weight Deep Autoencoder Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04988)
*Yue Li,Weifan Wang,Tai Sing Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies how familiarity training impacts early layers of a Vision Transformer autoencoder, showing that it aligns latent representations with global context and broadens self-attention, emphasizing LoRA-based fast weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Better understanding how the early visual cortex learns global context rapidly, focusing on the mechanisms involving recurrent neural circuits and their neural manifolds.

Method: Employing a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder with LoRA-based fast weights to study the effects of familiarity training on hierarchical networks.

Result: (1) Similarity between the ViT-based autoencoder's manifold transformation and neural circuits modeling familiarity. (2) Alignment of early and top-layer latent representations with global context. (3) Expansion of self-attention after familiarity training. (4) Amplification of these effects via LoRA-based fast weights.

Conclusion: Familiarity training augments global sensitivity in early network layers and demonstrates a hybrid fast-slow weight architecture as a computational model for rapid global context learning.

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

### [101] [Attribute Guidance With Inherent Pseudo-label For Occluded Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04998)
*Rui Zhi,Zhen Yang,Haiyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes AG-ReID, a framework for person re-identification (Re-ID) that tackles occlusions and subtle attribute differences using fine-grained semantics from pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision-language models in Re-ID struggle with occluded scenarios and subtle appearance differences by neglecting fine-grained detailed information.

Method: The AG-ReID framework first generates attribute pseudo-labels for extracting fine-grained characteristics. Then, it employs a dual-guidance mechanism combining holistic and fine-grained data for robust feature extraction.

Result: AG-ReID significantly improves performance on occluded Re-ID datasets and subtle attribute differences while maintaining competitiveness on standard Re-ID tasks.

Conclusion: AG-ReID demonstrates an effective integration of fine-grained attributes into Re-ID, achieving state-of-the-art results and showing the importance of combining holistic and detailed information in Re-ID tasks.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

### [102] [CRAM: Large-scale Video Continual Learning with Bootstrapped Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05001)
*Shivani Mall,Joao F. Henriques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM), a method for continual video learning that uses compressed video embeddings to reduce memory requirements while addressing catastrophic forgetting in online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable neural networks to learn from continuous video streams efficiently, achieving smaller storage requirements and better handling of natural distribution shifts.

Method: The method involves storing compressed video embeddings instead of raw data, using a rehearsal-based approach in a rolling memory buffer, and refreshing these embeddings to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing video continual learning benchmarks on datasets such as EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, while reducing memory usage to under 2 GB for thousands of long videos.

Conclusion: CRAM enables efficient continual video learning with a reduced memory footprint and improved performance, addressing key challenges of video continual learning like high memory usage and forgetting.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

### [103] [Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05008)
*Xusheng Liang,Lihua Zhou,Nianxin Li,Miao Xu,Ziyang Song,Dong Yi,Jinlin Wu,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning (MCDRL) framework for improving domain generalization in medical image segmentation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation challenges arise due to domain shifts in data caused by confounders like equipment differences and imaging modes. Existing Vision-Language Models struggle with generalization in medical domains.

Method: MCDRL employs CLIP-based identification of lesion regions, constructs a confounder dictionary through text prompts, and trains a causal intervention network to eliminate confounding effects while maintaining anatomical structure.

Result: Experimental results indicate MCDRL achieves higher segmentation accuracy and robustly generalizes across varied medical imaging domains compared to competing methods.

Conclusion: MCDRL offers an effective solution for domain generalization in medical image segmentation by integrating causal inference and VLM capabilities, addressing confounding variations and improving accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

*Shushi Wang,Chunyi Li,Zicheng Zhang,Han Zhou,Wei Dong,Jun Chen,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset designed to assess the quality of AI-enhanced user-generated content (AI-UGC), filling a critical gap in quality evaluation for this hybrid image type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perceptual quality assessment models lack the ability to effectively evaluate AI-UGC, which combines features from enhanced User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC), limiting user experience and further development of enhancement technologies.

Method: The authors create the AU-IQA benchmark dataset containing 4,800 AI-UGC images derived from enhancements such as super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. They subsequently evaluate various conventional and multimodal quality assessment models on this dataset.

Result: The research identifies how existing quality assessment models, including conventional Image Quality Assessment (IQA) techniques and large multimodal models, perform when applied to AI-UGC images.

Conclusion: The study provides a benchmark and comprehensive evaluation to encourage the development of new models specialized in analyzing AI-UGC quality, addressing an essential need in the field.

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

*Sadia Kamal,Tim Oates,Joy Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces skin-SOAP, a multimodal framework for automating SOAP note generation using lesion images and sparse clinical text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of clinician burnout and labor-intensive documentation caused by manual SOAP note generation in skin carcinoma treatment.

Method: Proposes a weakly supervised framework combining lesion image inputs and sparse clinical text, alongside evaluating with MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score metrics.

Result: Skin-SOAP matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro on relevant clinical metrics.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient, accurate SOAP note generation, reducing reliance on large data annotations and alleviating clinician workload.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

*Md Redwanul Haque,Manzur Murshed,Manoranjan Paul,Tsz-Kwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SCSSIM, a novel statistical metric to assess Scene Composition Structure (SCS) fidelity in generative AI image outputs, addressing limitations of existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficiency of traditional metrics (pixel-level, perception-based, and neural-network-based) in evaluating the structural integrity of generative AI images.

Method: Authors introduce SCSSIM, a statistical and training-free metric that evaluates SCS fidelity by leveraging statistical measures derived from Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images.

Result: Experiments show that SCSSIM maintains invariance to non-compositional distortions and responds effectively to compositional changes by reflecting altered SCS.

Conclusion: SCSSIM outperforms existing metrics in structural evaluation and is a valuable tool for maintaining SCS integrity in generative model outputs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents the "Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts" (HAMoBE) model for video-based person re-identification (ReID), using multi-layer features and focusing on dynamic biometric features. It achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based ReID methods overlook the selection of most discriminative features from query-gallery pairs, which limits their effectiveness in surveillance and security.

Method: The paper introduces HAMoBE, which uses multi-layer features extracted from a pre-trained large model like CLIP and models biometric features like appearance, body shape, and gait. It includes a dual-input decision gating network to dynamically adjust experts' contributions.

Result: HAMoBE achieves notable performance improvements, including a +13.0% increase in Rank-1 accuracy on benchmarks such as MEVID.

Conclusion: The proposed HAMoBE framework provides a robust and adaptive solution for video-based person re-identification, helping to improve the precision and reliability of biometric matching in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how MLLMs handle fine-grained detail extraction and reasoning in complex document layouts, which has been understudied.

Method: Developed NiM benchmark comprising diverse real-world documents; proposed Spot-IT method utilizing intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention inspired by human zoom and focus behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments highlighted limitations in existing MLLMs, while Spot-IT showed significant improvements in fine-grained detail extraction tasks.

Conclusion: MLLMs require enhanced strategies for handling intricate document understanding tasks. Spot-IT improves their performance, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges studied.

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve single-image PBR material estimation in complex lighting conditions, addressing the limitations of existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The method uses two latent spaces: one optimized for albedo estimation and another for metallic-roughness. Feature distillation ensures consistent predictions, with enhanced efficiency through rectified flow. Patch-based estimation and cross-view attention extend its use to high-resolution and multi-view inputs.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with up to 28% better albedo estimation and 39% reduced metallic-roughness prediction errors compared to current methods.

Conclusion: DualMat provides a robust solution for accurate, efficient PBR material estimation and integrates seamlessly into image-to-3D pipelines.

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS suggests a two-stage CSS framework to address catastrophic forgetting by decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks while maintaining a balance between retention and adaptability in continual semantic segmentation.

Method: A two-stage framework: Stage 1 leverages adapted pre-trained text/image encoders for class-specific detection, and Stage 2 employs the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for class-agnostic segmentation.

Result: Improved retention-plasticity balance and state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks.

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS effectively mitigates interference between old and new class learning, enhancing continual learning in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

*Ruiyu Li,Changyuan Qiu,Hangrui Cao,Qihan Ren,Yuqing Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores automatic image colorization using classification and adversarial learning, proposing modifications to existing methods for improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image colorization is an ill-posed problem with numerous applications, and leveraging scene semantics and textures can aid in addressing the challenge.

Method: The paper employs classification and adversarial learning techniques, building and modifying prior models for specific scenarios.

Result: The authors aim to provide comparisons and insights by testing modified models against prior implementations.

Conclusion: Leveraging adversarial and classification approaches enhances the automatic image colorization process, presenting valuable insights for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

TL;DR: FLUX-Makeup is a makeup transfer framework designed for better transfer quality, facial identity consistency, and robustness without the need for auxiliary components, using source-reference image pairs and novel architectural features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing methods in makeup transfer which rely on auxiliary components introducing errors, and to enhance the fidelity, identity consistency, and robustness of transfer results.

Method: The framework builds on FLUX-Kontext using source images as conditional inputs, and introduces RefLoRAInjector for efficient extraction of makeup features, alongside a robust data generation pipeline for paired datasets.

Result: FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance in makeup transfer, displaying significant robustness and quality across diverse scenarios in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes prior limitations, demonstrating high-fidelity and identity-consistent makeup transfer without auxiliary components, enabled by innovative data and architectural design.

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaFusion is a framework that integrates multiple Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) to achieve enhanced accuracy and model interpretability in histopathology-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs are powerful but suffer from latent biases and lack transparency, posing challenges for downstream applications requiring generalization and interpretability.

Method: AdaFusion compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse PFMs and uses a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse their outputs based on tissue phenotype context.

Result: Experiments on real-world benchmarks show AdaFusion consistently surpasses individual PFMs in predictive tasks and offers insights into each model's biosemantic specialization.

Conclusion: AdaFusion bridges heterogeneous PFMs, providing better performance and interpretability, while addressing inherent biases in the models.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

### [114] [PoseGen: In-Context LoRA Finetuning for Pose-Controllable Long Human Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05091)
*Jingxuan He,Busheng Su,Finn Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGen introduces a method to generate long, high-quality videos featuring consistent subject identity and motion from a single reference image and a pose sequence, overcoming identity drift and duration limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with generating videos that maintain subject identity over long durations and coherent motion control, prompting the need for improvement.

Method: PoseGen uses an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy combined with an interleaved segment generation method. It incorporates subject appearance at token levels for identity preservation and pose conditioning at channel levels for motion accuracy.

Result: The framework outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in preserving identity fidelity, ensuring pose accuracy, and generating artifact-free, coherent videos of unrestricted duration.

Conclusion: PoseGen offers an effective solution for generating arbitrarily long, temporally consistent videos with precise subject identity and motion, showcasing advancements in video generation technology.

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

### [115] [Sculpting Margin Penalty: Intra-Task Adapter Merging and Classifier Calibration for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05094)
*Liang Bai,Hong Song,Jinfu Li,Yucong Lin,Jingfan Fan,Tianyu Fu,Danni Ai,Deqiang Xiao,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a method to improve Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) by strategically using margin penalties during training to balance base-class accuracy and new-class generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of maintaining base-class discriminability and enabling generalization to new classes in FSCIL under data privacy and cost constraints, and mitigating ambiguous decision boundaries caused by limited data.

Method: The SMP method introduces two components: 1) Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM), which trains two adapter sets with different margin settings and merges them for forward compatibility; and 2) Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC), which fine-tunes decision boundaries during incremental tasks using margin penalties.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets like CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200 show that SMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in FSCIL, achieving better balance between base-class discriminability and new-class performance.

Conclusion: SMP effectively addresses the challenges in FSCIL by employing margin penalties to optimize both base-class accuracy and future compatibility, offering a robust solution for real-world scenarios with limited data.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

### [116] [AHDMIL: Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning for Fast and Accurate Whole-Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05114)
*Jiuyang Dong,Jiahan Li,Junjun Jiang,Kui Jiang,Yongbing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents AHDMIL, a framework using asymmetric hierarchical distillation to eliminate irrelevant patches in whole slide images for faster and more accurate pathological image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high inference costs in analyzing thousands of patches in gigapixel whole slide images for multi-instance learning in pathological image classification.

Method: AHDMIL employs a two-step procedure: training the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN) with self-distillation to identify patch relevance, and asymmetric distillation to train the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN) for patch pre-screening.

Result: AHDMIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification performance and inference speed across four public datasets. For example, it provides a 5.3% accuracy improvement and 1.2-times faster inference on Camelyon16.

Conclusion: AHDMIL achieves both higher accuracy and faster inference for pathological image classification, making it a promising solution to handle large-scale whole slide image analysis efficiently.

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

### [117] [Latent Expression Generation for Referring Image Segmentation and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05123)
*Seonghoon Yu,Joonbeom Hong,Joonseok Lee,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for visual grounding tasks by generating multiple latent expressions from a single textual input to address mismatches between rich visual details and sparse textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing visual grounding methods rely on single textual inputs, which capture limited cues, leading to misidentification of visually similar objects.

Method: The proposed framework uses subject distributor and visual concept injector modules, along with a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy, to generate latent expressions embedding shared and distinct visual details.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in referring image segmentation (RIS), referring expression comprehension (REC), and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating latent visual expressions effectively enhances visual grounding tasks, achieving better alignment between textual inputs and visual attributes.

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

*Sachin Dudda Nagaraju,Ashkan Moradi,Bendik Skarre Abrahamsen,Mattijs Elschot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedGIN, a Federated Learning framework for multimodal medical image segmentation, addressing challenges like data scarcity and privacy restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance clinical workflows by developing accurate segmentation models that generalize across imaging modalities while adhering to privacy constraints.

Method: FedGIN incorporates a Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module to harmonize modality-specific intensity distributions during local training in a Federated Learning setup.

Result: FedGIN improves segmentation accuracy, achieving 12-18% gains in limited-data settings and up to 30% improvement over MRI-only baselines in complete datasets.

Conclusion: FedGIN showcases strong cross-modality generalization and near-centralized performance under privacy constraints, making it suitable for real-world multimodal medical applications.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

### [119] [Deep Learning-based Animal Behavior Analysis: Insights from Mouse Chronic Pain Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05138)
*Yu-Hsi Chen,Wei-Hsin Chen,Chien-Yao Wang,Hong-Yuan Mark Liao,James C. Liao,Chien-Chang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces a method to automatically analyze chronic pain behaviors in mice using a novel framework, outperforming human experts in classification tasks and offering insights into drug efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for assessing chronic pain behavior in mice rely on manual labeling, which can be biased and inaccurate in identifying behaviors indicative of chronic pain.

Method: The study employs a universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse action features from video data, avoiding human labeling biases. Additionally, it introduces a dataset documenting neuropathic and inflammatory pain progression in mice.

Result: The proposed method achieved 48.41% accuracy in a 15-class chronic pain classification task, significantly outperforming human experts (21.33%) and the B-SOiD method (30.52%). In a simplified 3-class classification, it scored 73.1% accuracy, surpassing human experts (48%) and B-SOiD (58.43%). It also demonstrated drug efficacy insights consistent with previous literature.

Conclusion: The method is promising in automating the assessment of chronic pain behaviors in preclinical studies, enhancing classification accuracy, and offering valuable insights for drug efficacy research, thereby supporting advancements in pain and drug-related studies.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

### [120] [Rotation Equivariant Arbitrary-scale Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05160)
*Qi Xie,Jiahong Fu,Zongben Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR) that incorporates rotation equivariance to address geometric distortion issues, improving structure preservation in high-resolution imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASISR often produces artifacts in high-resolution recoveries because geometric patterns like textures and edges are distorted in low-resolution images. Embedding rotation equivariance can maintain the original orientation and structure in such patterns.

Method: The authors redesign the encoder and implicit neural representation (INR) modules to incorporate rotation equivariance, building a network with end-to-end rotational integrity. They also provide a theoretical analysis to evaluate intrinsic equivariance errors.

Result: Experiments on simulated and real datasets validate that the designed ASISR method effectively preserves geometric structures and improves performance. The framework is also compatible with existing systems for further enhancement.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust improvement in retaining structural integrity during ASISR, with promising applications in plug-and-play integration with existing models.

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-MoGen is a unified framework for cross-species (human and animal) text-driven motion generation, leveraging a novel dataset and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven motion generation approaches typically treat humans and animals separately, missing out on the benefits of a unified framework, but face challenges from morphological differences which compromise plausibility.

Method: X-MoGen employs a two-stage architecture with a conditional graph variational autoencoder for canonical T-pose priors, a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss, and masked motion modeling for text-based motion generation.

Result: X-MoGen, trained on the UniMo4D dataset covering 115 species and 119k motion sequences, surpasses state-of-the-art motion generation methods for both seen and unseen species.

Conclusion: X-MoGen successfully demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of a unified cross-species text-driven motion generation framework, addressing challenges of morphological differences and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PhysPatch, an advanced adversarial patch framework targeting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving, improving both attack effectiveness and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of MLLMs used in autonomous driving to adversarial patch attacks creates a critical need to address real-world security and safety threats.

Method: PhysPatch was developed using joint optimization for location, shape, and content of adversarial patches. The method includes a semantic-based mask initialization strategy, an SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize, and a potential field-based mask refinement method.

Result: PhysPatch significantly outperformed existing adversarial attack methods, demonstrating enhanced steering of MLLM-based systems in various models and ensuring feasible real-world application.

Conclusion: PhysPatch presents a highly effective and applicable framework for real-world adversarial attacks on MLLM-based autonomous driving systems, overcoming prior performance limitations.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT), a method to handle unseen categories in vision-based multitarget tracking through adaptive tracklet generation and association framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multitarget tracking struggles with unseen categories due to challenges like low-confidence detections, weak constraints, and occlusions.

Method: The approach uses tracklet generation clustering based on spatio-temporal correlation and optimizes tracklet associations using clues like location and appearance over time.

Result: Experiments on generic multiple object tracking benchmarks confirm the proposed framework's competitive performance.

Conclusion: MTT improves long-term object tracking by mitigating error propagation and effectively handling unseen challenges in multitarget tracking scenarios.

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

*Zhiqing Xiao,Haobo Wang,Xu Lu,Wentao Ye,Gang Chen,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPA++, a framework for Domain Adaptation (DA) that uses spectral alignment and refinement mechanisms to improve transferability and discriminability across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tradeoff in Domain Adaptation where inter-domain transferability is prioritized while rich intra-domain structures are overlooked, leading to reduced discriminative performance.

Method: The SPA++ framework comprises three main steps: graph-based domain alignment using spectral regularization, neighbor-aware propagation for finer discriminability in the target domain, and data augmentation with consistency regularization for adaptation in diverse scenarios.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that SPA++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates superior robustness and versatility across varied DA settings and challenging distribution shifts.

Conclusion: SPA++ enhances the balance between transferability and discriminability in Domain Adaptation, with theoretical underpinnings and practical evidence of its improved robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

TL;DR: The study introduces SPEX, a multimodal vision-language model for land cover extraction in remote sensing, improving pixel-level interpretations using spectral data encoded in a novel dataset called SPIE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral information is critical in remote sensing yet remains underutilized in pixel-level interpretation. The study aims to address this gap by integrating spectral data into vision-language models.

Method: The researchers developed a dataset (SPIE) to encode spectral priors into textual attributes and designed the SPEX model with specific strategies such as multiscale feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual pre-training.

Result: SPEX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five multispectral datasets, effectively extracting land cover categories like vegetation, buildings, and water bodies. It also offers textual explanations for increased interpretability.

Conclusion: SPEX enhances land cover extraction by leveraging encoded spectral data in vision-language models, advancing precision, flexibility, and user-friendliness in remote sensing applications. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoMatcher significantly enhances feature matching in endoscopic images using multi-domain pre-training and robust feature extraction, solving challenges like weak textures and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense feature matching in endoscopic images is a critical need for robot-assisted tasks like 3D reconstruction and surgical navigation but faces challenges with difficult visual conditions and limited annotated data.

Method: EndoMatcher utilizes a two-branch Vision Transformer with dual interaction blocks for robust feature extraction and leverages Endo-Mix6, a multi-domain dataset, alongside a progressive multi-objective training strategy to ensure balanced learning.

Result: EndoMatcher outperforms existing methods, improving inlier matches by over 140% to 201% on key datasets and increasing prediction accuracy by around 9% under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: EndoMatcher, paired with the comprehensive Endo-Mix6 dataset, achieves robust zero-shot generalization in endoscopic image matching tasks, paving the way for improvements in surgical scene understanding and related applications.

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

### [127] [VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information Flow-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05211)
*Sihan Yang,Runsen Xu,Chenhang Cui,Tai Wang,Dahua Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFlowOpt enhances Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by pruning 90% of visual tokens, maintaining equivalent performance, and significantly improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant computational costs caused by token redundancy in LMMs by exploring more sophisticated and effective pruning frameworks.

Method: VFlowOpt introduces an importance map calculation using attention-derived context relevance and entropy, a progressive pruning module with token recycling, and a visual information flow-guided optimization strategy.

Result: VFlowOpt achieves a 90% reduction in visual tokens while maintaining comparable model performance, reducing KV-Cache memory by 89%, and enabling inference speeds that are 3.8 times faster.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces computational costs and memory usage of LMMs without compromising their performance, showcasing sophisticated pruning strategies tailored to different models.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

### [128] [Textual and Visual Guided Task Adaptation for Source-Free Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05213)
*Jianming Liu,Wenlong Qiu,Haitao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a source-free method for cross-domain few-shot segmentation that leverages textual and visual data for task adaptation without requiring source domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of segmentation performance degradation caused by domain discrepancies and the need for source-free approaches due to privacy concerns and reduced data transfer/training costs.

Method: The method involves appending Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to a pretrained backbone and training their parameters through Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) and Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) modules.

Result: The proposed method achieves segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18% (1-shot) and 4.11% (5-shot) across four cross-domain datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts to target domain tasks using minimal labeled samples and significantly enhances cross-domain few-shot segmentation without relying on source domain data.

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReasoningTrack, a novel vision-language tracking framework leveraging reasoning and pre-trained vision-language models for enhanced target tracking. It also presents a new benchmark dataset, TNLLT, for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing vision-language tracking methods, such as inflexible target specifications and underperformance due to suboptimal model reasoning and utilization of large models.

Method: The paper introduces ReasoningTrack, a framework based on Qwen2.5-VL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and GRPO reinforcement learning for reasoning and language generation. Updated language descriptions are integrated with visual features for tracking.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReasoningTrack on various benchmark datasets. Additionally, the new TNLLT dataset provides a robust evaluation foundation with 200 video sequences and re-trained 20 baseline visual trackers.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack effectively improves vision-language tracking accuracy and flexibility through enhanced reasoning and language generation. The TNLLT dataset contributes to advancing evaluation standards in this field.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

*Semanur Küçük,Cosimo Della Santina,Angeliki Laskari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) v2.1 for segmenting complex bubble shapes in multiphase flows, achieving accurate results with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gas bubble segmentation in multiphase flows is critical in industrial applications but remains unsolved for deformed, coalesced bubble structures. Current techniques rely on assumptions of near-spherical shapes, limiting their utility.

Method: The study employs the Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1, fine-tuning it using 100 manually annotated images, to approach the segmentation task as a transfer learning problem.

Result: The fine-tuned SAM v2.1 could effectively segment highly non-convex and irregular bubble shapes in multiphase flow systems.

Conclusion: Modern vision foundation models like SAM can be adapted with minimal data to solve complex industrial segmentation challenges.

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

*Yatong Lan,Jingfeng Chen,Yiru Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arbiviewgen is a diffusion-based framework for generating images from arbitrary points of view using features like Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of arbitrary viewpoint image generation presents a strong potential for autonomous driving but is hindered by the absence of ground-truth data for unseen views.

Method: The framework introduces FAVS for geometric correspondences and fine-grained alignment, and CVC-SSL for self-supervised cross-view consistency using diffusion models.

Result: Arbiviewgen successfully generates high-fidelity images from arbitrary viewpoints without the need for additional sensors or depth maps, using only multi-camera images and poses.

Conclusion: This is a novel and first-of-its-kind approach for controllable arbitrary viewpoint image generation applicable in multiple vehicle setups.

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of improving adversarial robustness in vision-language models without compromising their zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Method: The paper synthesizes approaches from adversarial fine-tuning techniques to training-free/test-time defenses, examining methods ranging from alignment preservation to embedding re-engineering.

Result: The review highlights advancements such as TeCoA, LAAT, TIMA, AOM, TTC, and CLIPure, providing a clear trajectory of defense evolution in VLMs.

Conclusion: The report identifies opportunities for hybrid defense strategies and the need for adversarial pre-training to address existing challenges and enhance the robustness of VLMs.

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial
pre-training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionMed-CLIP introduces a region-aware multimodal learning framework for medical image-text analysis, addressing limitations in annotated data and reliance on global features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in automated medical image understanding, particularly the scarcity of annotated data and the dependence on global image features that neglect localized pathological regions.

Method: RegionMed-CLIP employs an innovative ROI processor blending fine-grained regional features with global context using hierarchical multimodal alignment, supported by MedRegion-500k—a corpus with regional annotations and clinical descriptions.

Result: RegionMed-CLIP substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models on tasks like image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Region-aware contrastive learning is essential for improved multimodal medical image understanding, and RegionMed-CLIP provides a robust foundation for the field's advancement.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes methods for gender classification using soft biometrics, focusing on traits such as iris and facial features, and reviews existing approaches, challenges, and gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to support surveillance, corporate profiling, and human-computer interaction by reviewing gender classification techniques to identify individuals through soft biometrics.

Method: It reviews literature on gender classification methods based on biometrics like iris and facial features, discusses current methodologies, and highlights gaps and challenges in the field.

Result: The study categorizes existing gender classification techniques, analyzes their methodologies, and pinpoints challenges and gaps in these approaches for researchers.

Conclusion: It serves as a resource for researchers, offering insights, highlighting challenges, and suggesting future directions for the advancement of gender classification techniques.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CF3, a fast and compact 3D Gaussian feature field pipeline that utilizes top-down processes and adaptive sparsification, reducing Gaussian usage by 95% while preserving detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and inefficiencies in current 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques for integrating 2D features into 3D models.

Method: CF3 employs three key strategies: weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features using pre-trained Gaussians, training a per-Gaussian autoencoder on the lifted 3D features, and introducing adaptive sparsification to optimize Gaussian usage.

Result: CF3 constructs a competitive 3D feature field using only 5% of the Gaussians required by prior methods while maintaining geometric and feature fidelity.

Conclusion: CF3 presents a significant improvement in efficiency for constructing 3D Gaussian fields by combining top-down pipelines and adaptive sparsification.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a robust particle filtering tracker with cyclic-consistency checks for real-time cardiac imaging in coronary bypass grafting surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness of local feature tracking in cardiac imaging for estimating cardiac perfusion, addressing challenges like heart motion and image variability.

Method: A particle filtering tracker with cyclic-consistency checks is introduced to follow landmarks reliably, even amidst complex cardiac motions.

Result: The proposed method tracks 117 targets at 25.4 fps with a tracking error of 5.00 ± 0.22 px, outclassing existing deep learning and traditional trackers.

Conclusion: The method enables real-time, accurate estimates of cardiac perfusion during interventions, making it highly suitable for intraoperative use.

Abstract: Intraoperative fluorescent cardiac imaging enables quality control following
coronary bypass grafting surgery. We can estimate local quantitative
indicators, such as cardiac perfusion, by tracking local feature points.
However, heart motion and significant fluctuations in image characteristics
caused by vessel structural enrichment limit traditional tracking methods. We
propose a particle filtering tracker based on cyclicconsistency checks to
robustly track particles sampled to follow target landmarks. Our method tracks
117 targets simultaneously at 25.4 fps, allowing real-time estimates during
interventions. It achieves a tracking error of (5.00 +/- 0.22 px) and
outperforms other deep learning trackers (22.3 +/- 1.1 px) and conventional
trackers (58.1 +/- 27.1 px).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDFuse leverages semantic masks and diffusion models for infrared and visible image fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods struggle with preserving key targets due to weak semantic scene understanding and artifacts introduced during fusion.

Method: SGDFuse employs the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate semantic masks and utilizes a conditional diffusion model for a two-stage fusion process: preliminary feature fusion followed by coarse-to-fine denoising guided by SAM.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance in image fidelity, semantic awareness, and adaptability to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SGDFuse effectively addresses core IVIF challenges, offering a semantically-aware and high-fidelity solution for improved image fusion quality.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in utilizing 4D LiDAR for MLLMs due to the lack of specific annotations and architectures capable of handling its rich spatial and temporal data.

Method: The authors developed B4DL, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR data, alongside a scalable data generation pipeline and a novel MLLM model that integrates raw 4D LiDAR with language processing.

Result: The study provides rendered videos, datasets, and inference outputs, demonstrating improved spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic outdoor environments.

Conclusion: The paper offers a unified solution for processing and understanding 4D LiDAR data, making it feasible for MLLMs to capture complex object interactions over time.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

### [139] [Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding for Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05271)
*Xiaoyang Zhang,Guodong Fan,Guang-Yong Chen,Zhen Hua,Jinjiang Li,Min Gan,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF) method is proposed for change detection in remote sensing imagery, leveraging frequency-domain modeling for enhanced edge and semantic precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote sensing change detection rely heavily on spatial-domain modeling, which limits the ability to detect fine-grained changes, particularly at edges.

Method: The method, WGDF, applies Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose images into high- and low-frequency components. High-frequency components are enhanced using a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE) module for edge details and a Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module for fine-grained changes. Low-frequency components use Transformers and a Progressive Contextual Difference Module (PCDM) for global structure refinement. These are then fused for unified sensitivity and discriminability.

Result: WGDF demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness in detecting changes, especially for edge details and global semantic structures, across multiple remote sensing datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WGDF enhances the capability to identify subtle changes in remote sensing imagery by combining frequency-domain techniques with deep learning, offering a robust solution for various applications like disaster monitoring and urban tracking.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at

Result: Their VS-LLM-based approach demonstrates a 17.6% improvement in accuracy compared to psychologist assessments in analyzing mental states through PPAT sketches.

Conclusion: This automated method significantly enhances the accuracy and scalability of mental state assessments via PPAT sketches, contributing to advancements in art therapy and psychological evaluation research.

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

*Xuyang Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCAViT, a visual backbone that improves generalization performance and robustness for smaller models, excelling in real-time tasks and out-of-distribution benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that smaller-scale models experience disproportionately larger performance drops on out-of-distribution data, indicating weaker generalization abilities.

Method: The authors identify key architectural deficiencies in smaller models and introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, which uses dynamic global tokens to bolster local-global feature modeling across domains efficiently.

Result: CoCAViT achieves strong performance metrics: 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection, and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: CoCAViT demonstrates robust real-time visual representation and improved adaptability, making it a promising approach for efficient and generalizable visual backbones.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

### [142] [mKG-RAG: Multimodal Knowledge Graph-Enhanced RAG for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05318)
*Xu Yuan,Liangbo Ning,Wenqi Fan,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces mKG-RAG, a novel approach for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) using multimodal knowledge graphs integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods for VQA rely heavily on unstructured documents, which can introduce irrelevant or inaccurate content and diminish the precision of answers.

Method: The proposed method constructs high-quality multimodal knowledge graphs using MLLM-powered keyword extraction and employs a dual-stage retrieval strategy with a question-aware multimodal retriever.

Result: Experiments confirm that mKG-RAG achieves significant improvements over previous methods, setting a new benchmark for VQA performance.

Conclusion: Integrating structured multimodal knowledge graphs into RAG frameworks enhances answer accuracy and reliability in knowledge-based VQA tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

### [143] [MELLA: Bridging Linguistic Capability and Cultural Groundedness for Low-Resource Language MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05502)
*Yufei Gao,Jiaying Fei,Nuo Chen,Ruirui Chen,Guohang Yan,Yunshi Lan,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset designed to enhance linguistic capabilities and cultural groundedness in low-resource languages for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the shortcomings of MLLMs in low-resource languages, particularly their lack of cultural informativeness and linguistic effectiveness, which are often neglected by existing methods relying solely on text or machine translation.

Method: The authors propose a dual-source strategy for data collection, utilizing native web alt-text to enhance cultural knowledge and MLLM-generated captions to improve linguistic capabilities.

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs on the MELLA dataset improves performance across eight low-resource languages, enabling models to provide both linguistic accuracy and culturally-informed 'thick descriptions.'

Conclusion: The MELLA dataset successfully enhances MLLMs in both cultural awareness and linguistic performance, presenting a promising solution for better serving low-resource language users.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

### [144] [Textual Inversion for Efficient Adaptation of Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors Without Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05323)
*Frank Ruis,Gertjan Burghouts,Hugo Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method inspired by Textual Inversion (TI) for fine-tuning large vision-language models (VLMs) for open-vocabulary object detection, allowing new tokens to be learned while preserving the original model's zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While state-of-the-art vision-language models achieve strong zero-shot capabilities, fine-tuning causes loss of their original natural language querying abilities and zero-shot domain adaptability.

Method: The authors adapt the Textual Inversion (TI) approach to extend the VLM vocabulary, enabling detection of novel objects with minimal examples. The original VLM weights remain frozen and the method limits storage and computation to token embeddings.

Result: The proposed method retains the zero-shot capabilities and original benchmark performance of the models while performing better than baseline fine-tuning methods across quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: This approach offers efficient and effective personalization of VLMs for specialized tasks, without sacrificing their generalization abilities or requiring significant computational resources.

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

### [145] [3DGabSplat: 3D Gabor Splatting for Frequency-adaptive Radiance Field Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05343)
*Junyu Zhou,Yuyang Huang,Wenrui Dai,Junni Zou,Ziyang Zheng,Nuowen Kan,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gabor Splatting (3DGabSplat) enhances the efficiency and quality of novel view synthesis by introducing a frequency-adaptive mechanism and 3D Gabor-based primitives, achieving better performance and lower memory consumption compared to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting, which struggles to capture high-frequency details in 3D scenes and suffers from redundant primitives, reduced efficiency, and excessive memory requirements.

Method: The authors propose 3D Gabor Splatting, which incorporates 3D Gabor-based primitives as a filter bank with multiple directional 3D frequency components to enhance representation flexibility and efficiency. They also develop an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer and introduce a frequency-adaptive optimization mechanism.

Result: 3DGabSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel view synthesis, with up to 1.35 dB PSNR improvement over 3DGS, while reducing the number of primitives and memory consumption. The approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat significantly improves efficiency and quality for novel view synthesis and is a plug-and-play enhancement for existing 3DGS frameworks. It provides better rendering quality and reduced computational resources compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

### [146] [PriorRG: Prior-Guided Contrastive Pre-training and Coarse-to-Fine Decoding for Chest X-ray Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05353)
*Kang Liu,Zhuoqi Ma,Zikang Fang,Yunan Li,Kun Xie,Qiguang Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PriorRG, a framework for chest X-ray report generation leveraging patient-specific prior knowledge (clinical context and prior images). It outperforms current methods in accuracy and fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of usage of patient-specific prior knowledge (e.g., clinical context and prior images) in existing chest X-ray report generation methods, which is essential for accurate diagnostics and assessing disease progression.

Method: The proposed PriorRG framework uses a two-stage training pipeline: (1) prior-guided contrastive pre-training to align clinical context with spatiotemporal features, and (2) coarse-to-fine decoding for integrating patient-specific prior knowledge with vision encoders to improve diagnostic alignment.

Result: Experiments conducted on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets showed that PriorRG significantly improves the quality of generated reports, with gains of 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 on MIMIC-CXR, and 5.9% BLEU-1 on MIMIC-ABN over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: PriorRG effectively uses clinical context and prior imaging to emulate real-world radiology workflows, improving the clinical relevance, accuracy, and fluency of generated chest X-ray reports.

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

### [147] [Cross-View Localization via Redundant Sliced Observations and A-Contrario Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05369)
*Yongjun Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yi Wan,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slice-Loc enhances cross-view localization (CVL) reliability using redundant observations from image slices and filters errors to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CVL methods are limited by only providing a single camera pose observation, making it hard to ensure reliability via mutual observation validation.

Method: Slice-Loc divides the input query image into sub-images, estimates 3-DoF poses for each slice, filters erroneous poses using a geometric rigidity formula, and merges accurate inliers for the final output. It applies an NFA model to ensure meaningfulness in localization.

Result: Slice-Loc reduces errors above 10 meters to under 3%, improves localization accuracy in cross-city tests, reducing mean errors from 4.47m to 1.86m and orientation errors from 3.42° to 1.24°.

Conclusion: Slice-Loc provides a reliable and accurate CVL framework by using redundant observations and eliminating gross localization errors, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

*Hamza Kalisch,Fabian Hörst,Jens Kleesiek,Ken Herrmann,Constantin Seibold*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CT-GRAPH, a graph-based framework for automating radiology report generation by integrating anatomical region details with global image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce radiologists' workload and enhance accuracy in radiology report generation by addressing the limitations of methods that rely solely on global image features.

Method: CT-GRAPH employs a hierarchical graph attention network that structures anatomical regions into a graph, refines the features using pretrained 3D medical encoders, and incorporates them into a language model for detailed report generation.

Result: CT-GRAPH demonstrates an absolute 7.9% improvement in F1 score compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on the CT-RATE dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures fine-grained organ relationships, improving radiology report generation and showcasing significant advancement over prior methods.

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

*Luozheng Qin,Jia Gong,Yuqing Sun,Tianjiao Li,Mengping Yang,Xiaomeng Yang,Chao Qu,Zhiyu Tan,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Uni-CoT, a unified framework to enhance multimodal reasoning in vision-language tasks using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal reasoning struggle to model visual state transitions coherently, often due to fragmented system architectures and limited capacity.

Method: Uni-CoT employs a two-level reasoning paradigm: Macro-Level CoT for task planning and Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. It also uses interleaved image-text supervision and multi-task objectives during training to enhance scalability and coherence.

Result: Uni-CoT sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on reasoning-driven benchmarks like WISE, RISE, and KRIS, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Uni-CoT is a scalable and efficient framework for coherent multimodal reasoning, using minimal computational resources while achieving high performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with deformable attention to improve classification of pathology images by capturing spatial dependencies and addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational pathology methods struggle with spatial dependencies and rely on static graph topologies, limiting their ability to focus on structurally important tissue regions.

Method: The paper proposes a dynamic graph-based GNN framework where nodes adaptively aggregate contextual information using learnable spatial offsets informed by real coordinates and deformable attention mechanisms.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art classification performance across four benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior capability in analyzing spatial structures.

Conclusion: Deformable attention within a dynamic GNN framework is effective for modeling spatial structures in pathology images, offering enhanced classification accuracy and better contextual understanding.

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO methods to improve natural language instruction mapping to screen coordinates without requiring additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing GUI grounding methods which rely heavily on pixel-level annotations that are costly and scarce.

Method: GUI-RC uses spatial voting grids for consensus-based test-time scaling, and GUI-RCPO applies reinforcement learning based on consistency rewards during inference.

Result: GUI-RC improves accuracy by 2-3% on benchmarks, boosting a specific model's performance from 80.11% to 83.57%, and GUI-RCPO improves it further to 85.14%.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enhance GUI grounding robustness and data efficiency, offering a viable path for developing better GUI agents without reliance on labeled annotations.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes UNCAGE, a training-free technique leveraging attention maps to improve text-to-image generation with Masked Generative Transformers, addressing compositional fidelity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of compositional fidelity in text-to-image generation, which has not been sufficiently explored with Masked Generative Transformers.

Method: UNCAGE employs Contrastive Attention Guidance to prioritize unmasking tokens linked to individual objects, thus enhancing text-image alignment during generation.

Result: Experiments show UNCAGE improves compositional fidelity in text-to-image generation across benchmarks and metrics, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: UNCAGE demonstrates consistent and effective enhancement in image generation tasks while highlighting its efficiency and importance in addressing compositional challenges.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

*Farah Wahida,M. A. P. Chamikara,Yashothara Shanmugarasa,Mohan Baruwal Chhetri,Thilina Ranbaduge,Ibrahim Khalil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TrueBiometric, a defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in face recognition systems, leveraging vision language models to detect and correct poisoned images with complete accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is addressing the vulnerabilities of biometric systems, particularly backdoor attacks, which jeopardize system security by manipulating training processes with malicious triggers.

Method: The method involves a majority voting mechanism using multiple vision language models to detect poisoned images. Detected images are then corrected with targeted and calibrated noise.

Result: TrueBiometric achieves 100% accuracy in identifying and correcting poisoned images without affecting the performance on clean images.

Conclusion: TrueBiometric provides a robust, generalizable, and practical solution to counter backdoor attacks, improving the reliability of biometric systems.

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

*Jiawei Liang,Siyuan Liang,Jianjie Huang,Chenxi Si,Ming Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework for adversarial camouflage to deceive deep object detectors, addressing challenges in physical environments, resulting in improved attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the security risk posed by adversarial camouflage in safety-critical fields, like autonomous driving, where deep object detectors are vulnerable to being deceived by altered textures in physical environments.

Method: The framework introduces two key strategies: gradient calibration for consistent updates across distances and gradient decorrelation for eliminating redundant updates and enhancing optimization stability across multiple angles.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an average attack success rate increase of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles in various scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for more robust object detection systems as the proposed adversarial technique significantly exposes vulnerabilities, posing risks in real-world applications.

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

### [155] [Smoothing Slot Attention Iterations and Recurrences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05417)
*Rongzhen Zhao,Wenyan Yang,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances Slot Attention (SA) in Object-Centric Learning (OCL) by introducing 'SmoothSA' with two core enhancements: preheating queries on the first frame and differentiating transformations between the first and subsequent frames for improved object aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in Slot Attention (SA) for Object-Centric Learning, such as the lack of sample-specific cues in query initialization on the first frame and the need for different transformations for subsequent frames.

Method: The authors propose 'SmoothSA,' which includes (1) preheating cold-start queries using a self-distilled module to incorporate meaningful cues, and (2) differentiating transformations applied to the first and non-first frames (full vs. single iterations) to smooth object aggregation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validate that SmoothSA improves object discovery, recognition, and performance on downstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: SmoothSA addresses long-standing issues in Slot Attention by introducing sample-specific initialization and frame-differentiated transformations, leading to better performance in Object-Centric Learning. Codes are provided in the supplement for further verification.

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

*Hubert Baniecki,Maximilian Muschalik,Fabian Fumagalli,Barbara Hammer,Eyke Hüllermeier,Przemyslaw Biecek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIxLIP is an explanation method based on game theory to capture second-order cross-modal interactions in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of explanations for language-image pre-trained models by addressing limitations of existing first-order attribution methods.

Method: Introduce FIxLIP using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index from game theory and adapt evaluation metrics for second-order interactions.

Result: FIxLIP outperformed existing first-order explanation methods in experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: FIxLIP enhances explanatory insights for vision-language models and aids in model comparison.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

### [157] [How and Why: Taming Flow Matching for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05461)
*Liangwei Li,Lin Liu,Juanxiu Liu,Jing Zhang,Ruqian Hao,Xiaohui Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method using Flow Matching, with key enhancements addressing conventional limitations to achieve high performance on the MVTec dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional flow-based methods have limitations in model expressivity for anomaly detection, leading to a need for improved paradigms.

Method: The paper leverages time-reversed Flow Matching with Worst Transport displacement interpolation to control sample trajectories and separate normal and anomalous samples.

Result: The approach successfully achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised anomaly detection tasks on the MVTec dataset.

Conclusion: Flow Matching provides a scalable and computationally effective anomaly detection framework, supported by theoretical insights and practical results, paving the way for further advancements.

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

### [158] [F2PASeg: Feature Fusion for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation in Endoscopic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05465)
*Lumin Chen,Zhiying Wu,Tianye Lei,Xuexue Bai,Ming Feng,Yuxi Wang,Gaofeng Meng,Zhen Lei,Hongbin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset and method for improving segmentation of anatomical structures during pituitary surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the lack of pixel-level annotated datasets for real-time segmentation in pituitary surgery, a crucial task to identify surgical risks and ensure safety.

Method: The authors created the PAS dataset (7,845 images from 120 videos) and propose F2PASeg, which uses a Feature Fusion module to combine high-resolution features and deep embeddings. Data augmentation was used to reduce class imbalance.

Result: F2PASeg showed consistent and real-time performance in accurately segmenting critical anatomical structures during pituitary surgeries.

Conclusion: The proposed F2PASeg method offers a robust and reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning, enhancing safety and accuracy.

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

*Samuel Räber,Till Aczel,Andreas Plesner,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how lossy image compression models affect resistance to adversarial attacks, finding that higher realism provides significant robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether preprocessing images using lossy compression can defend against adversarial attacks and to analyze how image realism impacts this defense.

Method: The authors construct strong white-box and adaptive attacks to evaluate different lossy compression models, analyzing the interplay between realism in reconstructed images and attack effectiveness.

Result: High-realism compression models demonstrate significantly higher resistance to attacks, whereas low-realism models are more vulnerable.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that realistic image reconstructions offer inherent robustness against adversarial attacks, representing a challenge for future attack development to maintain comprehensive security evaluations.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

*Yunshuang Yuan,Frank Thiemann,Thorsten Dahms,Monika Sester*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting mechanism for segmenting historical maps using a modified foundation model called SMOL-MapSeg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical maps are challenging to analyze using standard pre-trained foundation models because their inconsistencies in visual patterns do not align with predefined concepts from modern images.

Method: The authors propose OND prompting, which uses explicit prompts to guide models on mapping patterns to concepts during on-need inference. They modified the SAM model’s prompt encoder to integrate OND prompting and fine-tuned the system on historical maps.

Result: The proposed model, SMOL-MapSeg, achieves accurate segmentation, supports adaptation to unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning, and outperforms a UNet-based baseline model in terms of segmentation performance.

Conclusion: OND knowledge-based prompting allows for flexible and effective segmentation of historical maps, offering adaptability to a wide range of classes and improving performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

TL;DR: AutoIAD is a framework for automated industrial visual anomaly detection using multi-agent collaboration and domain-specific knowledge. It outperforms existing approaches in task completion and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the manual effort required in industrial anomaly detection and improve manufacturing quality control.

Method: AutoIAD uses a Manager-Driven central agent to coordinate sub-agents for tasks like data preparation, model design, and training, leveraging a domain-specific knowledge base.

Result: Experiments show superior task completion rate, AUROC performance, and reduced hallucination issues compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: AutoIAD is effective in developing automated anomaly detection solutions, with its manager agent and domain knowledge module being critical components.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

### [162] [Symmetry Understanding of 3D Shapes via Chirality Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05505)
*Weikang Wang,Tobias Weißberg,Nafie El Amrani,Florian Bernard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised chirality feature extractor for shapes like point clouds and meshes, improving tasks like shape matching and part segmentation using chirality-aware features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chirality information, crucial for distinguishing left from right, is largely underexplored in shape analysis compared to image analysis, despite its importance.

Method: The authors build on the Diff3F framework to create an unsupervised pipeline that extracts chirality-aware features for shape vertices using 2D foundation models.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across various datasets show the extracted chirality features are effective in tasks like left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the utility of chirality-aware features in shape analysis, offering practical solutions to longstanding challenges in symmetric part disambiguation.

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

*Shibo Wang,Haonan He,Maria Parelli,Christoph Gebhardt,Zicong Fan,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MagicHOI reconstructs hands and objects from monocular videos with limited viewpoints using diffusion models for unseen regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen object regions during real-world reconstructions due to static viewpoints and grips.

Method: MagicHOI uses novel view synthesis diffusion models for object supervision and incorporates visible contact constraints.

Result: MagicHOI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in hand-object reconstruction, especially under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates the effectiveness of using diffusion priors to regularize unseen object regions and improve 3D reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Most RGB-based hand-object reconstruction methods rely on object templates,
while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

*Lin Zhu,Ruonan Liu,Xiao Wang,Lizhi Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a self-supervised pre-training framework for event cameras to extract latent information for downstream visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have unique advantages like high temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, but their sparse and noisy data complicates feature extraction.

Method: The framework involves three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, Backbone-fixed Feature Transition, and Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning.

Result: The proposed framework consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation.

Conclusion: This approach effectively improves feature extraction and semantic discrimination, making it highly suitable for challenging visual scenarios.

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

*Zewei Wu,César Teixeira,Wei Ke,Zhang Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robust pedestrian tracking method that addresses occlusion issues using richer feature representations and a refined motion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in pedestrian tracking caused by occlusions in scenarios where multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, often leading to compromised trajectory stability.

Method: The proposed method enhances appearance modeling with detection features from object detectors and head keypoint detection. It also introduces an iterative Kalman filtering approach with 3D priors for better motion trajectory modeling.

Result: The method combines improved appearance and motion models, offering better tracking robustness in crowded environments with significant occlusions.

Conclusion: The study presents a comprehensive framework that effectively enhances multi-object tracking performance in complex crowded scenarios by tackling occlusion challenges with novel feature and motion modeling techniques.

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models that applies randomized smoothing in feature space instead of input space, claiming significant robustness and efficiency improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing defenses for IQA models, which primarily use Gaussian noise on input images, compromising image quality and computational efficiency.

Method: The method applies noise in the feature space, analyzes the backbone network's Jacobian, and supports full-reference and no-reference models without altering their architecture. It offers computational efficiency with a single forward pass per image.

Result: The method reduces inference time significantly—by 99.5% without certification and 20.6% with certification applied—and improves correlation with subjective quality scores by up to 30.9%.

Conclusion: The approach offers a robust and efficient alternative to existing certification methods for IQA models while preserving image fidelity and demonstrating superior experimental performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiencies in manual clinical trial data review processes which struggle with growing data volumes and complexity.

Method: A controlled study was conducted using Octozi, combining large language models and domain-specific heuristics, with experienced clinical reviewers participating.

Result: The platform improved cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold, reduced errors by 6.44-fold, and minimized false positive queries by 15.48-fold.

Conclusion: AI-assisted systems like Octozi can streamline clinical trial data cleaning, accelerating drug development and reducing costs, while maintaining compliance.

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for structural pruning in neural networks, named Optimal Brain Connection, leveraging a novel saliency criterion and fine-tuning mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural pruning methods often overlook how parameters are interconnected, leading to suboptimal pruning.

Method: The paper introduces the Jacobian Criterion to measure saliency based on parameter interactions and proposes an Equivalent Pruning mechanism using autoencoders to retain pruned connections during fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results show the Jacobian Criterion outperforms other metrics in maintaining performance, and the Equivalent Pruning approach reduces performance loss after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The Optimal Brain Connection framework provides an effective solution for enhancing structural pruning by better considering parameter interconnections and mitigating performance degradation.

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

### [169] [When Deepfake Detection Meets Graph Neural Network:a Unified and Lightweight Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05526)
*Haoyu Liu,Chaoyu Gong,Mengke He,Jiate Li,Kai Han,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSTGNN is a lightweight graph neural network framework for detecting AI-manipulated videos by analyzing spatial, temporal, and spectral inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread development of generative video models has made it urgent to detect AI-manipulated videos, particularly since existing methods struggle to generalize across manipulation types and often require large models.

Method: SSTGNN uses a Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network structure, which models videos as graphs, incorporates spectral filters and temporal differential modeling, and simultaneously detects spatial, temporal, and spectral inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that SSTGNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in both in-domain and cross-domain settings with high robustness to unseen manipulations, using significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: SSTGNN proves to be an efficient and scalable solution for detecting manipulated videos, demonstrating strong detection performance while maintaining a highly lightweight architecture suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

*Adi Levi,Or Levi,Sardhendu Mishra,Jonathan Morra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for brand safety classification in content moderation, benchmarking their effectiveness with a new multilingual, multimodal dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in online video content demands scalable, nuanced moderation due to operational and mental health limitations of human reviewers.

Method: The authors benchmark MLLMs like Gemini, GPT, and Llama using a novel, professionally labeled dataset across various risk categories.

Result: MLLMs are evaluated for their accuracy and cost-efficiency in brand safety classification, with detailed analyses of their limitations and failure cases.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of MLLMs in scalable, multimodal content moderation while highlighting current challenges. The dataset is released to promote further research.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

### [171] [Looking into the Unknown: Exploring Action Discovery for Segmentation of Known and Unknown Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05529)
*Federico Spurio,Emad Bahrami,Olga Zatsarynna,Yazan Abu Farha,Gianpiero Francesca,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Action Discovery as a new approach within Temporal Action Segmentation, aiming to handle ambiguous and incomplete action annotations in partially labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scenarios where annotated datasets contain only a subset of well-defined actions, while subtle or infrequent actions remain unlabeled, common in fields like neuroscience.

Method: The paper proposes a two-step approach: Granularity-Guided Segmentation Module (GGSM) for identifying temporal intervals of actions and Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA) to classify unknown actions using embedding similarities.

Result: The method was systematically tested on datasets including Breakfast, 50Salads, and Desktop Assembly, showing significant improvements over existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully improves temporal and semantic granularity in action segmentation tasks with partially labeled datasets, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents 'Follow-Your-Instruction,' an automated data synthesis framework using Multimodal Large Language Models for generating high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data, aiming to support AI-generated content more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the growing need for high-quality, scalable datasets for AI-generated content, while addressing the challenges of cost and time associated with real-world data collection and manual scene construction.

Method: The proposed framework, 'Follow-Your-Instruction,' collects multimodal assets and descriptions using MLLM-Collector, constructs 3D layouts, employs vision-language models for refinement, and uses MLLM-Planner for generating temporally coherent data sequences.

Result: Experiments across various generative tasks demonstrate that their synthesized data significantly improves the performance of existing baseline models.

Conclusion: 'Follow-Your-Instruction' proves to be a scalable and effective data generation system, enhancing AI generative capabilities and reducing reliance on manual data collection and curation.

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

### [173] [DART: Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05585)
*Haijing Liu,Tao Pu,Hefeng Wu,Keze Wang,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the DART framework for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR), aiming to improve object localization and category reasoning by enhancing vision-language models with adaptive refinement and transfer modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models in fine-grained localization and inter-class reasoning, especially for unseen object categories in open-vocabulary multi-label tasks.

Method: DART incorporates two modules: an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM) for intra-class localization using a Weakly Supervised Patch Selecting (WPS) loss, and an Adaptive Transfer Module (ATM) that uses a Class Relationship Graph (CRG) derived from Large Language Models (LLM) to transfer relational knowledge between classes.

Result: Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that DART outperforms previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in OV-MLR tasks.

Conclusion: The DART framework successfully integrates adaptive intra-class refinement and LLM-derived relational knowledge, providing a significant advancement for OV-MLR models and setting a new benchmark in performance.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

### [174] [WeTok: Powerful Discrete Tokenization for High-Fidelity Visual Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05599)
*Shaobin Zhuang,Yiwei Guo,Canmiao Fu,Zhipeng Huang,Zeyue Tian,Ying Zhang,Chen Li,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WeTok, a visual tokenizer designed to optimize the compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in vision generation tasks, surpassing previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers face limitations in balancing efficient compression and accurate reconstruction, highlighting a need for innovation.

Method: WeTok leverages two innovations: Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ) for scalable and efficient encoding and Generative Decoding (GD) for modeling distributions and improving visual reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate WeTok's superior performance in benchmark comparisons, achieving record-low rFID scores and high compression ratios over competitors.

Conclusion: WeTok presents a significant advancement in visual tokenization, improving generation capabilities while maintaining high compression efficiency.

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

*Tao Sun,Oliver Liu,JinJin Li,Lan Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-RE introduces a binary relevancy evaluation method for image-text pairing using Multimodal Large Language Models, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of evaluating whether images and texts are relevant, a fundamental task for multimodal generative AI systems.

Method: The authors use the LLaVA architecture enhanced with detailed task instructions, multimodal in-context samples, and a novel binary relevancy dataset.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of their framework in handling binary relevancy evaluation across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The study establishes Multimodal Large Language Models as effective tools for evaluating image-text relevancy, showcasing the potential of LLaVA-RE in improving multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

*Yuhan Zhang,Long Zhuo,Ziyang Chu,Tong Wu,Zhibing Li,Liang Pan,Dahua Lin,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hi3DEval, a hierarchical evaluation framework for 3D content, addressing deficiencies of image-based metrics by combining object-level and part-level evaluations. It also includes a dataset, Hi3DBench, and a scoring system for assessing material realism and spatial coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for assessing 3D content quality are limited to image-based approaches, which fail to adequately evaluate spatial coherence, material realism, and detailed fidelity.

Method: The authors developed Hi3DEval, which uses object-level and part-level evaluations. They also created Hi3DBench, a large dataset with annotations, and proposed a scoring system combining video-based and pretrained 3D feature representations.

Result: Their method demonstrated superior performance in capturing 3D-specific characteristics and aligning with human preferences compared to traditional image-based evaluations.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval provides a scalable and reliable alternative to manual evaluation of 3D generative content by effectively addressing limitations in existing metrics.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

*Henghui Ding,Kaining Ying,Chang Liu,Shuting He,Xudong Jiang,Yu-Gang Jiang,Philip H. S. Torr,Song Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSEv2 introduces a more challenging dataset for video object segmentation (VOS) under real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art VOS methods perform well on current benchmarks but struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios due to simplified dataset conditions.

Method: MOSEv2 extends its predecessor MOSEv1 with 5,024 videos, over 700,000 high-quality masks, and more diverse and complex challenges such as occlusions, weather conditions, and camouflaged objects.

Result: Benchmarks using 20 VOS and 9 tracking methods showed performance drops, emphasizing challenges in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Despite advances in VOS, MOSEv2 highlights the limitations of current methods when dealing with complex, real-world scenarios, providing a robust dataset for further research.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly
available at https://MOSE.video.

*Weiqi Zhang,Junsheng Zhou,Haotian Geng,Wenyuan Zhang,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAP, a novel method to generate high-quality 3D Gaussians from raw point clouds using text guidance and multi-view optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Converting raw, colorless 3D point clouds into usable Gaussian forms remains an open challenge in rendering applications.

Method: GAP uses a multi-view optimization framework with a depth-aware image diffusion model, surface-anchoring mechanism for geometric accuracy, and an inpainting strategy for completing difficult regions.

Result: GAP is evaluated on diverse 3D Point-to-Gaussian tasks, showing effectiveness on synthetic points, real-world scans, and large-scale scenes.

Conclusion: GAP successfully bridges the gap between raw point clouds and Gaussian representations, enhancing rendering fidelity and geometry accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

*Mohammed Talha Alam,Fahad Shamshad,Fakhri Karray,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FaceAnonyMixer, a framework for generating privacy-preserving face images meeting biometric template protection requirements, while maintaining high recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to address privacy concerns in face recognition technologies by developing methods that protect identity while maintaining recognition performance, adhering to biometric template protection criteria such as revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility.

Method: The FaceAnonyMixer framework irreversibly mixes a real face's latent code with a key-derived synthetic code using a pre-trained generative model. The resulting mixed latent code is refined using a multi-objective loss function to meet cancelable biometric criteria.

Result: FaceAnonyMixer achieves strong privacy protection and superior recognition accuracy on benchmark datasets, outperforming recent cancelable biometric methods by over 11% in tests on commercial APIs.

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer successfully generates privacy-preserving, cancelable faces that integrate seamlessly with existing face recognition systems and outperform existing methods in both privacy and accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPTIMUMP2P, a novel gossip algorithm leveraging Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to improve information dissemination in decentralized networks, outperforming the existing Gossipsup protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in enhancing the performance and reliability of libp2p's gossip protocols, particularly in decentralized systems like blockchains, which demand efficient and secure data dissemination.

Method: The authors propose OPTIMUMP2P, utilizing RLNC to accelerate data distribution in peer-to-peer networks and ensure reliable delivery, even amidst malicious attempts to corrupt data.

Result: Simulation and real-world evaluations show OPTIMUMP2P outperforms Gossipsub in terms of both performance and reliability.

Conclusion: OPTIMUMP2P demonstrates significant improvements over existing libp2p gossip protocols, making it a promising solution for decentralized system communication.

Abstract: Gossip algorithms are pivotal in the dissemination of information within
decentralized systems. Consequently, numerous gossip libraries have been
developed and widely utilized especially in blockchain protocols for the
propagation of blocks and transactions. A well-established library is libp2p,
which provides two gossip algorithms: floodsup and gossibsup. These algorithms
enable the delivery of published messages to a set of peers. In this work we
aim to enhance the performance and reliability of libp2p by introducing
OPTIMUMP2P, a novel gossip algorithm that leverages the capabilities of Random
Linear Network Coding (RLNC) to expedite the dissemination of information in a
peer-to-peer (P2P) network while ensuring reliable delivery, even in the
presence of malicious actors capable of corrupting the transmitted data.
Preliminary research from the Ethereum Foundation has demonstrated the use of
RLNC in the significant improvement in the block propagation time [14]. Here we
present extensive evaluation results both in simulation and real-world
environments that demonstrate the performance gains of OPTIMUMP2P over the
Gossipsub protocol.

*Khaled Jawhar,Evangelos Kranakis*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper examines how two autonomous robots, with asymmetric communication abilities, can perform a linear search to capture a moving target under different scenarios, focusing on their competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how asymmetry in communication capabilities between two robots influences their ability to effectively search for and capture a moving target.

Method: The authors propose and analyze linear search algorithms tailored for scenarios where two robots—one capable of sending messages wirelessly and the other capable of receiving—must capture a moving target. They account for factors such as the target's direction of movement, starting distance, and speed.

Result: The study provides analysis on the competitive ratio of the search algorithms across various configurations, shedding light on the influence of communication asymmetry under both away and toward movement models of the target.

Conclusion: The results advance theoretical understanding of robotic collaboration in search tasks, particularly highlighting the impact of asymmetric communication on search efficiency in varied scenarios.

Abstract: We consider linear search for capturing an oblivious moving target by two
autonomous robots with different communicating abilities. Both robots can
communicate Face-to-Face (F2F) when co-located but in addition one robot is a
Sender (can also send messages wirelessly) and the other also a Receiver (can
also receive messages wirelessly). This is known as Sender/Receiver (S/R, for
short) communication model. The robots can move with max speed $1$. The moving
target starts at distance $d$ from the origin and can move either with speed
$v<1$ away from the origin in the ``away'' model or with speed $v \geq 0$
toward the origin in the ``toward'' model. We assume that the direction of
motion of the target (i.e., whether it is the away or toward model) is known to
the robots in advance. To capture the target the two robots must be co-located
with it.
  We design new linear search algorithms and analyze the competitive ratio of
the time required to capture the target. The approach takes into account

Abstract: Gen3 is an open-source data platform for building data commons. A data
commons is a cloud-based data platform for managing, analyzing, and sharing
data with a research community. Gen3 has been used to build over a dozen data
commons that in aggregate contain over 28 PB of data and 64 million FAIR data
objects. To set up a Gen3 data commons, you first define a data model. Gen3
then autogenerates 1) a data portal for searching and exploring data in the
commons; 2) a data portal for submitting data to the commons; and 3) FAIR APIs
for accessing the data programmatically. Gen3 is built over a small number of
standards-based software services, which are designed to support current and
future Gen3 components so that Gen3 can interoperate with other data platforms
and data ecosystems.

*Song Bian,Saurabh Agarwal,Md. Tareq Mahmood,Shivaram Venkataraman*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents Tesserae, a GPU cluster scheduler incorporating novel graph-matching-based placement policies, which enhance job scheduling efficiency. Experiments show it significantly improves key performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies or poor scalability in existing deep learning cluster job placement policies by designing a more effective and scalable solution.

Method: The placement constraints are reformulated as graph matching problems, enabling new policies for job migration reduction and job packing. These policies are integrated into the Tesserae scheduler framework.

Result: Tesserae demonstrated up to 1.62x improvement in average job completion time (JCT) and up to 1.15x enhancement in Makespan compared to existing schedulers.

Conclusion: Tesserae effectively improves DL cluster scheduling by combining scalability and computational efficiency for better resource utilization.

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models has become a dominant workload in
data-centers and improving resource utilization is a key goal of DL cluster
schedulers. In order to do this, schedulers typically incorporate placement
policies that govern where jobs are placed on the cluster. Existing placement
policies are either designed as ad-hoc heuristics or incorporated as
constraints within a complex optimization problem and thus either suffer from
suboptimal performance or poor scalability. Our key insight is that many
placement constraints can be formulated as graph matching problems and based on
that we design novel placement policies for minimizing job migration overheads
and job packing. We integrate these policies into Tesserae and describe how our
design leads to a scalable and effective GPU cluster scheduler. Our
experimental results show that Tesserae improves average JCT by up to 1.62x and
the Makespan by up to 1.15x compared with the existing schedulers.

TL;DR: This paper presents an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based solver for compressible flows, implemented in the Regent programming language, achieving significant speedups through task fusion and GPU kernel optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-order solvers for compressible flows require optimization to reduce computational costs, with AMR helping to enhance problem resolution efficiently.

Method: The authors developed an AMR solver using Regent and tackled implementation challenges like dynamic data structures, mesh validity, and task launch overhead through strategies like task fusion and GPU kernel annotations.

Result: Task fusion achieved an 18x speedup, while automated GPU kernel generation provided a 9.7x improvement. The solver's effectiveness was validated on two canonical compressible flow problems under the Euler equations.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of Regent in building efficient AMR-based solvers for compressible flow simulations, achieving considerable computational performance improvements.

Abstract: High-order solvers for compressible flows are vital in scientific
applications. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a key technique for reducing
computational cost by concentrating resolution in regions of interest. In this
work, we develop an AMR-based numerical solver using Regent, a high-level
programming language for the Legion programming model. We address several
challenges associated with implementing AMR in Regent. These include dynamic
data structures for patch refinement/coarsening, mesh validity enforcement, and
reducing task launch overhead via task fusion. Experimental results show that
task fusion achieves 18x speedup, while automated GPU kernel generation via
simple annotations yields 9.7x speedup for the targeted kernel. We demonstrate
our approach through simulations of two canonical compressible flow problems
governed by the Euler equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in handling large-scale datasets (many-terabyte range) with affordable and high-throughput solutions leveraging GPUs, while minimizing data movement and optimizing memory utilization.

Method: Developed Theseus, a distributed GPU-accelerated query engine with specialized asynchronous control mechanisms and optimized memory subsystems that manage host memory allocations to boost throughput and reduce fragmentation.

Result: Theseus shows up to 4× performance improvement over Databricks Photon for TPC-H benchmarks and can process TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarks at a massive scale (100 TB) using only 2 DGX A100 640GB nodes.

Conclusion: Theseus demonstrates an efficient and scalable solution for analytics of massive datasets by leveraging GPU acceleration, achieving high throughput, cost efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Online analytical processing of queries on datasets in the many-terabyte
range is only possible with costly distributed computing systems. To decrease
the cost and increase the throughput, systems can leverage accelerators such as
GPUs, which are now ubiquitous in the compute infrastructure. This introduces
many challenges, the majority of which are related to when, where, and how to
best move data around the system. We present Theseus -- a production-ready
enterprise-scale distributed accelerator-native query engine designed to
balance data movement, memory utilization, and computation in an
accelerator-based system context. Specialized asynchronous control mechanisms
are tightly coupled to the hardware resources for the purpose of network
communication, data pre-loading, data spilling across memories and storage, and
GPU compute tasks. The memory subsystem contains a mechanism for fixed-size
page-locked host memory allocations to increase throughput and reduce memory
fragmentation. For the TPC-H benchmarks at scale factors ranging from 1k to 30k
on cloud infrastructure, Theseus outperforms Databricks Photon by up to
$4\times$ at cost parity. Theseus is capable of processing all queries of the
TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarks at scale factor 100k (100 TB scale) with as few as
2 DGX A100 640GB nodes.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a heterogeneity-aware distributed large language model (LLM) simulator to better estimate training time in environments with diverse hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for large-scale GPU clusters in distributed model training creates barriers for innovation due to challenges like device heterogeneity in real-world systems.

Method: The authors developed a distributed LLM simulator that accounts for hardware heterogeneity and allows users to configure device groups and parallelism mapping.

Result: Initial simulations show that their approach effectively highlights how heterogeneity affects computation and communication times in model training.

Conclusion: By addressing device heterogeneity, the proposed simulator bridges the gap between idealized homogeneous assumptions and practical training environments.

Abstract: The growing demand for large-scale GPU clusters in distributed model training
presents a significant barrier to innovation, particularly in model
optimization, performance tuning, and system-level enhancements. To address
this challenge, LLM training simulators are employed to estimate training time
and guide design decisions. However, the state-of-the-art LLM training
simulators assume homogeneous compute and network infrastructure. In practice,
device heterogeneity is inevitable due to resource sharing in cloud
environments, frequent shifts in device generations, and inherent intra-chip
interconnect heterogeneity. To address the gap between state-of-the-art and
practical requirements, we propose the design of a heterogeneity-aware
distributed LLM simulator capable of predicting training time while enabling
abstractions to specify custom configurations for device groups and
device-to-parallelism mapping. We present the design requirements and
challenges in building a heterogeneity-aware distributed ML training simulator,
and design components such as non-uniform workload partitioning. Our initial
simulation results demonstrate the impact of heterogeneity on the model
computation and communication time.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FastBioDL, a parallel file downloader optimized for large-scale biological datasets, showing significant speed improvements over existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools used for downloading large-scale biological datasets do not adapt to dynamic network conditions, leading to bandwidth inefficiencies and prolonged download durations.

Method: FastBioDL employs an adaptive concurrency controller using an online optimization approach with a utility function and gradient descent to adjust concurrent socket streams dynamically during downloads.

Result: FastBioDL demonstrated performance improvements of up to 4x over leading download tools in public genomic dataset tests and up to 2.1x speed improvement in high-speed network conditions.

Conclusion: FastBioDL offers a robust, efficient solution for genomic data retrieval, enhancing efficiency and accessibility without relying on specialized software or advanced protocols.

Abstract: Modern next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects routinely generate terabytes
of data, which researchers commonly download from public repositories such as
SRA or ENA. Existing download tools often employ static concurrency settings,
leading to inefficient bandwidth utilization and prolonged download times due
to their inability to adapt to dynamic network conditions. We introduce
FastBioDL, a parallel file downloader designed for large biological datasets,
featuring an adaptive concurrency controller. FastBioDL frames the download
process as an online optimization problem, utilizing a utility function and
gradient descent to adjust the number of concurrent socket streams in real-time
dynamically. This approach maximizes download throughput while minimizing
resource overhead. Comprehensive evaluations on public genomic datasets
demonstrate that FastBioDL achieves up to $4x$ speedup over state-of-the-art
tools. Moreover, in high-speed network experiments, its adaptive design was up
to $2.1x$ faster than existing tools. By intelligently optimizing standard HTTP
or FTP downloads on the client side, FastBioDL provides a robust and efficient
solution for large-scale genomic data acquisition, democratizing
high-performance data retrieval for researchers without requiring specialized
commercial software or protocols.

Motivation: The necessity for rapid and reliable transfer of large datasets across geographically distributed locations, challenging traditional transfer tools that suffer from inefficiencies and instability.

Method: A modular data transfer architecture using deep reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO); tasks are decoupled, and training is accelerated using a lightweight network-system simulator.

Result: AutoMDT achieved 8x faster convergence and reduced transfer completion times by 68% in production-grade test beds, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: AutoMDT demonstrates significant advances in data transfer efficiency through modular design and innovative use of reinforcement learning techniques, making it suitable for dynamic and high-demand scenarios.

Abstract: High-performance applications necessitate rapid and dependable transfer of
massive datasets across geographically dispersed locations. Traditional file
transfer tools often suffer from resource underutilization and instability
because of fixed configurations or monolithic optimization methods. We propose
AutoMDT, a novel modular data transfer architecture that employs a deep
reinforcement learning based agent to simultaneously optimize concurrency
levels for read, network, and write operations. Our solution incorporates a
lightweight network-system simulator, enabling offline training of a Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) agent in approximately 45 minutes on average, thereby
overcoming the impracticality of lengthy online training in production
networks. AutoMDT's modular design decouples I/O and network tasks, allowing
the agent to capture complex buffer dynamics precisely and to adapt quickly to
changing system and network conditions. Evaluations on production-grade
testbeds show that AutoMDT achieves up to 8x faster convergence and a 68%
reduction in transfer completion times compared with state-of-the-art

*Shruti Saxena,Arijit Khan,Joydeep Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAEx is a framework designed to explain decisions made by network alignment models by identifying influential subgraphs and features, maintaining model fidelity and facilitating cross-network comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network alignment models, despite advancements, lack interpretability, hindering trust and understanding, especially in sensitive applications.

Method: NAEx uses learnable edge and feature masks for joint parameterization and defines optimization objectives to ensure faithful and comparative explanations of cross-network dependencies.

Result: NAEx was tested on benchmark datasets with four network alignment models, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency in generating inductive explanations.

Conclusion: NAEx is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic tool that enhances interpretability of network alignment by preserving dependency fidelity and improving explanation clarity.

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

### [190] [Agnostics: Learning to Code in Any Programming Language via Reinforcement with a Universal Learning Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04865)
*Aleksander Boruch-Gruszecki,Yangtian Zi,Zixuan Wu,Tejas Oberoi,Carolyn Jane Anderson,Joydeep Biswas,Arjun Guha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agnostics, a pipeline to optimize large language models (LLMs) for low-resource programming languages using a universal verifier for code behavior and language-agnostic reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs excel in widely used programming languages but struggle with low-resource ones due to limited training data and complex post-training setups.

Method: Agnostics uses a single behavior-based verifier, conversion of unit tests to I/O format, a short configuration for language-specific compilation, and RLVR in a robust code execution setup.

Result: Agnostics demonstrated improved performance in five low-resource languages, enabling models to rival much larger ones and achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach simplifies RL post-training for any programming language and ensures scalability. Resources for training and configurations will be open-sourced to support broader adoption.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing text-to-image (T2I) generation models in handling complex instructions, ensuring detailed control, and maintaining semantic consistency.

Method: The proposed framework, LumiGen, uses two main components: (1) Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) for proactive prompt enhancement, and (2) Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) as a visual critic for iterative image correction and optimization.

Result: LumiGen outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models with an average score of 3.08 on the LongBench-T2I Benchmark, showcasing significant enhancements in aspects like text rendering and pose accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating LVLMs into T2I generation frameworks, as demonstrated by LumiGen, results in more controllable and higher-quality images, especially in tasks requiring detailed semantic understanding and visual precision.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

Method: The study explores the use of Echo State Networks (ESNs) for cryptocurrency forecasting and incorporates chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent to evaluate performance during chaotic periods.

Result: The research shows that ESNs outperform alternative machine learning techniques significantly during periods of high volatility and chaotic behavior.

Conclusion: Echo State Networks are robust and highly effective for forecasting in financial markets, especially during extreme volatility, with results supported by chaos analysis metrics such as the Lyapunov exponent.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes

can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme
volatility. We also conduct chaos analysis through the Lyapunov exponent in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses computational challenges for diffusion models on edge devices by proposing a novel hierarchical federated learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies and privacy concerns of edge-based Diffusion Models in personalized content generation.

Method: A Cluster-aware hierarchical federated aggregation framework, utilizing LoRA for fine-tuning, intra-cluster aggregation, and inter-cluster knowledge sharing.

Result: The framework demonstrated accelerated convergence and scalability for multi-user personalized content generation under edge constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables efficient and privacy-preserving edge inference, balancing personalization and scalability.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance both interpretability and performance in control policies, addressing the limitations of deep reinforcement learning in safety-critical applications.

Method: Proposed Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted Evolutionary Search (MLES), combining multimodal large language models for policy generation with evolutionary optimization and visual feedback-driven analysis to improve policy discovery.

Result: MLES demonstrated comparable efficiency and performance to Proximal Policy Optimization while providing interpretable control policies across two control tasks.

Conclusion: MLES enables efficient, interpretable, and scalable control policy discovery, making it suitable for broader, real-world deployment and a promising candidate for future advancements.

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

TL;DR: This paper explores a Few-shot Learning (FSL) framework using a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), showing significant performance gains compared to traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of limited labeled samples in scientific domains, where data is often scarce and costly to obtain.

Method: The authors constructed M3FD, a diverse dataset, and introduced M3F—a modular pipeline framework fine-tuned on M3FD for enhanced generalization in FSL tasks.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms conventional meta-learning models in FSL tasks across various scientific data modalities.

Conclusion: M3F and M3FD provide a scalable, unified solution for deploying LMMMs in data-constrained scientific applications, promoting accessibility and reproducibility.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

*Zhikai Zhao,Chuanbo Hua,Federico Berto,Kanghoon Lee,Zihan Ma,Jiachen Li,Jinkyoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajEvo introduces a framework using Large Language Models and evolutionary algorithms to automatically derive trajectory prediction heuristics, improving performance in accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in traditional and deep learning-based trajectory prediction methods, focusing on accuracy, explainability, computational efficiency, and generalization.

Method: The paper combines Large Language Models with evolutionary algorithms using innovations like Cross-Generation Elite Sampling and Statistics Feedback Loop for refining trajectory heuristics.

Result: TrajEvo shows superior performance compared to both heuristic and deep learning approaches, particularly in generalizing to unseen scenarios, as validated on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TrajEvo represents progress in automated, fast, and explainable trajectory prediction, paving the way for future advancements in human behavior modeling in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

### [198] [AttriLens-Mol: Attribute Guided Reinforcement Learning for Molecular Property Prediction with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04748)
*Xuan Lin,Long Chen,Yile Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol is an LLM-based framework leveraging attribute-guided reinforcement learning to improve molecular property prediction results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM models for molecular property prediction rely on human-created prompts, resulting in verbose or irrelevant reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces AttriLens-Mol, which uses three reinforcement learning-based rewards: format, count, and rationality, to steer reasoning and elicit relevant molecular attributes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate AttriLens-Mol's competitive or superior performance compared to both supervised models and advanced reasoning models, with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol effectively extracts relevant molecular attributes, boosting prediction accuracy and interpretability through guided reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

### [199] [PA-RNet: Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04750)
*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PA-RNet, a framework designed to improve multimodal time series forecasting by addressing noise in textual data, enhancing model robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal time series data often struggle with textual noise, which degrades forecasting models' accuracy, especially when noise is intense or structurally inconsistent.

Method: The authors propose PA-RNet, which utilizes a perturbation-aware projection module and cross-modal attention mechanism to filter noise while retaining meaningful textual representations. They also establish theoretical guarantees and present a textual perturbation pipeline for evaluation.

Result: PA-RNet achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across diverse domains and temporal scenarios, showing remarkable robustness under varied textual noise conditions.

Conclusion: PA-RNet enhances generalization and stability for multimodal forecasting tasks by addressing textual noise, offering practical tools and theoretical insights for tackling real-world challenges.

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [200] [InfoQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization via Global Information Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04753)
*Mehmet Emre Akbulut,Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby,Fabrizio Pittorino,Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoQ is a training-free framework for Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ) optimizing bit-width allocation efficiently by measuring mutual information changes during a forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for determining optimal bit-widths in MPQ struggle with complexity and fail to account for global effects of quantization error across layers.

Method: InfoQ quantizes layers at different bit-widths and uses mutual information changes in subsequent layers to guide an integer linear programming-based allocation process.

Result: InfoQ achieves better search-time/accuracy trade-offs, uses significantly less data compared to LIMPQ, and improves accuracy by up to 1% at high compression rates.

Conclusion: InfoQ offers a computationally efficient and accurate MPQ solution by focusing on global impacts on information flow rather than local layer-specific properties.

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

*Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates open-source large language models (LLMs) as agents for dynamic insulin dosing in Type 1 diabetes and assesses their performance against traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models, identifying both their potential and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to simplify the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical decision-making by leveraging LLMs' natural language reasoning to reduce the need for extensive environment-specific training and expert knowledge injection.

Method: The researchers tested the zero-shot inference capability of open-source LLMs in a Type 1 diabetes simulator and compared their performance to reinforcement learning agents trained specifically for the task.

Result: Smaller LLMs demonstrated comparable or superior performance to RL agents in stable patient settings, though issues like excessive insulin dosing and reasoning failures were also observed.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for clinical use with careful optimization, their limitations necessitate further validation, prompt engineering, and hybrid methods to ensure safe and effective deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

### [202] [HFedATM: Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization via Optimal Transport and Regularized Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05135)
*Thinh Nguyen,Trung Phan,Binh T. Nguyen,Khoa D Doan,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFedATM, a method enhancing Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) by addressing domain shift issues through a novel aggregation technique, boosting performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability challenges and domain shift in Federated Learning hinder its robustness and performance across unseen domains, necessitating novel methods to enhance HFL frameworks.

Method: HFedATM employs Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment to align convolutional filters across station models and Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean Aggregation for efficient model merging.

Result: Experiments show HFedATM improves performance of existing FedDG baselines across datasets, with computational and communication efficiency. Theoretical analyses reveal tighter generalization error bounds.

Conclusion: HFedATM successfully mitigates domain shifts in HFL, offering faster convergence, stable training, and improved robustness in hierarchical architectures.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

### [203] [Uncertainty-aware Predict-Then-Optimize Framework for Equitable Post-Disaster Power Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04780)
*Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Rongchao Xu,Tian Tang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses inequities in power system restoration by proposing the EPOPR framework for balancing restoration efficiency and equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inequities in power restoration caused by disadvantaged communities submitting fewer restoration requests, which leads to extended outages for these groups.

Method: The authors design the EPOPR framework, combining Equity-Conformalized Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware prediction and Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL for equitable decision-making.

Result: Experimental results show a 3.60% reduction in average power outage duration and a 14.19% decrease in inequity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EPOPR effectively enhances both efficiency and equity in power system restoration, addressing disparities in disadvantaged communities.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

### [204] [Gaussian mixture layers for neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04883)
*Sinho Chewi,Philippe Rigollet,Yuling Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Gaussian Mixture (GM) layer for neural networks inspired by mean-field theory, offering an alternative implementation of training dynamics using probability measures. Its performance is demonstrated to be comparable to traditional fully connected layers on simple classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean-field theory has advanced understanding of neural networks but primarily focuses on infinitely wide networks. There’s a gap in exploring direct implementations of dynamics over probability measures, which can potentially expand the modeling capabilities of neural networks.

Method: The authors leverage Gaussian mixture models combined with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows to derive training dynamics. This results in proposing a new Gaussian mixture layer that can integrate with existing neural network architectures.

Result: The GM layer achieved test performance similar to fully connected layers in simple classification tasks. Additionally, numerical experiments showed different behavioral dynamics compared to classical layers, even in the mean-field regime.

Conclusion: The proposed GM layer shows potential as a flexible and theoretically grounded neural network component. It offers a distinct behavior and comparable performance, hinting at new avenues for neural network design and training paradigms.

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

### [205] [X-VFL: A New Vertical Federated Learning Framework with Cross Completion and Decision Subspace Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05568)
*Qinghua Yao,Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-VFL, a Vertical Federated Learning framework addressing challenges of non-aligned data samples, missing features, and locally independent inference while showing high performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Vertical Federated Learning, such as aligning data samples across parties and enabling independent inference for clients all with missing features.

Method: The paper proposes X-VFL with two key modules: Cross Completion (XCom) for feature reconstruction, and Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align) for inference alignment. It also establishes convergence rates for the training methods.

Result: X-VFL shows significant improvements in accuracy, including 15% on CIFAR-10 dataset and 43% on the MIMIC-III dataset, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: X-VFL effectively handles missing features and allows independent inference, proving its practicality and superiority for real-world datasets.

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

*Jaehyung Lim,Wonbin Kweon,Woojoo Kim,Junyoung Kim,Seongjin Choi,Dongha Kim,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), combining Federated Learning and Continual Learning to address privacy-preserving recommendations with streaming data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of effectively maintaining recommendation quality over time in federated environments, while adapting to evolving non-stationary data streams under privacy constraints.

Method: The authors propose F3CRec, a framework with two components—Adaptive Replay Memory for retaining past preferences on the client side and Item-wise Temporal Mean for integrating new and prior knowledge on the server side.

Result: F3CRec outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior recommendation quality over time within a privacy-preserving federated environment.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between privacy-preserving federated learning and continual learning, offering an effective solution for evolving user preferences in real-world federated systems.

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RCUKF framework combining reservoir computing and unscented Kalman filtering for enhanced modeling and state estimation in complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve modeling and state estimation in complex systems where obtaining reliable process models is challenging.

Method: Combining reservoir computing for learning nonlinear dynamics from data with the unscented Kalman filter for integrating real-time sensor data.

Result: The proposed RCUKF framework performs effectively on benchmark problems and in real-time vehicle trajectory estimation tasks, even in high-dimensional and chaotic regimes.

Conclusion: RCUKF is a robust and reliable framework for state estimation in challenging system dynamics, where traditional mathematical models fail.

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

*Lin Jiang,Yu Yang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces HCRide, a system addressing conflicts in ride-hailing dispatch by balancing passenger fairness and driver preference using a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing systems prioritize operator revenue, often neglecting passenger experience and driver satisfaction. This paper aims to create a human-centered ride-hailing system balancing these factors without loss of efficiency.

Method: HCRide operates using Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), incorporating a multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic actor network, and a bi-critic network.

Result: HCRide demonstrated significant improvements: system efficiency (+2.02%), fairness (+5.39%), and driver preference (+10.21%) compared to current benchmarks, evaluated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The novel HCRide system successfully harmonizes passenger fairness and driver preferences while maintaining high efficiency, offering substantial advancements in ride-hailing order dispatch systems.

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of selecting the best-performing machine learning algorithm on unseen datasets given marginal performance differences among top candidates.

Method: The authors formalize the task as a subset selection problem for multinomial distributions and propose both asymptotic and finite-sample schemes tailored to improve accuracy and confidence in results.

Result: The proposed methods significantly outperform existing approaches and are validated with matching lower bounds that demonstrate their efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework and methods proposed provide a robust and accurate solution to subset selection problems in competitive performance scenarios, such as evaluating machine learning algorithms on future tasks.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

### [210] [Unified Flow Matching for Long Horizon Event Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04843)
*Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for modeling long-horizon marked event sequences, addressing limitations of existing autoregressive methods by introducing a non-autoregressive, flow matching-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome efficiency issues and error accumulation in long-range forecasting caused by autoregressive neural temporal point process models.

Method: A unified flow matching framework that uses continuous and discrete flow matching to jointly model inter-event times and event types, eliminating sequential decoding.

Result: The proposed method outperforms autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in accuracy and generation efficiency, as shown in evaluations on six real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that non-autoregressive modeling via flow matching can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of long-horizon event sequence forecasting.

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

*Robert Frenken,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Hanqin Zhang,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel intrusion detection framework for automotive CAN traffic that uses unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph learning to enhance cybersecurity. It achieves notable accuracy and efficiency improvements, especially on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bolster the cybersecurity of the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, used for in-vehicle communication, which remains vulnerable due to the lack of inherent security features.

Method: The authors propose a multi-stage intrusion detection approach combining Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for anomaly detection and Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for attack classification. CAN traffic is encoded into graph sequences to capture temporal and relational dependencies, addressing class imbalance via selective undersampling and utilizing score-level fusion.

Result: The framework achieves an average improvement of 16.2% in F1-score over existing methods across six datasets, excelling particularly in imbalanced datasets with up to a 55% F1-score improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture significantly enhances intrusion detection in automotive CAN traffic, offering greater prediction accuracy and efficiency while reducing model complexity. This makes it highly suited for deployment in automotive cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

### [212] [Negative Binomial Variational Autoencoders for Overdispersed Latent Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05423)
*Yixuan Zhang,Wenxin Zhang,Hua Jiang,Quyu Kong,Feng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents NegBio-VAE, an extension of variational autoencoders (VAEs) using negative binomial distribution to better model the variability of biological spiking neurons, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological spike trains exhibit more variability than conventional VAEs, such as Poisson-VAE, can model due to their rigid constraints (equal mean and variance).

Method: NegBio-VAE uses negative binomial distribution to allow better modeling of overdispersion in spike counts. Two ELBO optimization schemes and two differentiable reparameterization techniques are proposed to adapt this framework.

Result: NegBio-VAE demonstrates significant improvement in reconstruction fidelity by explicitly modeling overdispersion compared to the Poisson-VAE.

Conclusion: Using the negative binomial distribution and introducing a dispersion parameter enhances modeling for neural spike data, providing a more biologically accurate and flexible solution.

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

*Haoyu Zhang,Shihao Zhang,Ian Colbert,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees for the OPTQ post-training quantization framework by providing quantitative error bounds for its deterministic and stochastic variants, as well as for related algorithms like Qronos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While PTQ, especially OPTQ (aka GPTQ), is widely adopted for reducing neural network costs, it lacks solid theoretical foundations. This work aims to fill that gap by rigorously analyzing its error behavior.

Method: The authors derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds for OPTQ's deterministic and stochastic procedures, while also extending their analysis to Qronos. They also evaluate the impact of calibration data, regularization parameters, and the heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm.

Result: The theoretical analysis justifies practical design choices for OPTQ, establishes stronger infinity-norm error bounds for its stochastic variant, and highlights the advantages of Qronos with both deterministic and stochastic variants.

Conclusion: This paper provides key theoretical insights and error bounds, validating the efficacy of OPTQ and Qronos, and offering guidance to enhance PTQ algorithms further.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and
stochastic variants, that help explain its empirical advantages.

*Saman Pordanesh,Pejman Shahsavari,Hossein Ghadjari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hilbert Neural Operator (HNO), a novel architecture leveraging the Hilbert Transform to enhance learning solution operators for PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operators like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) face limitations due to periodicity assumptions and lack of incorporation of rich signal-analysis perspectives.

Method: HNO applies the Hilbert Transform to generate analytic signal representations, extracting instantaneous amplitude and phase as explicit features for spectral convolution.

Result: A theoretically backed architecture is proposed that potentially excels in modeling causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary systems.

Conclusion: The Hilbert Neural Operator offers additional advantages over traditional Fourier-based methods by embedding signal-processing biases into neural operator design.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

*Kelsey Doerksen,Yuliya Marchetti,Steven Lu,Kevin Bowman,James Montgomery,Kazuyuki Miyazaki,Yarin Gal,Freddie Kalaitzis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning model to predict bias in surface ozone estimates for improved regional air quality assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution poses significant health risks, and current models struggle to effectively predict trends in pollutants like surface ozone.

Method: An uncertainty-aware U-Net architecture incorporating Bayesian and quantile regression is used for regional modeling of surface ozone residuals.

Result: The model was applied to June 2019 data from North America and Europe, successfully quantifying biases and evaluating land-use information's influence.

Conclusion: The approach improves model interpretability and uncertainty quantification, aiding in policy-making and air quality management strategies.

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 2D CNN approach to address biases in ozone surface modeling, outperforming traditional methods and aiding environmental policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in accurately modeling surface ozone levels, a critical factor for human health, and to understand global ozone trends at scales relevant to health impacts.

Method: A 2D Convolutional Neural Network is used to estimate residuals (model bias) of the physics-based MOMO-Chem model, incorporating land use data from high-resolution satellite imagery.

Result: The proposed technique captures model residuals more effectively than traditional machine learning methods in North America and Europe.

Conclusion: The approach can enhance our understanding of ozone bias at urban scales and contribute to improved environmental policies.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

*Rahuul Rangaraj,Jimeng Shi,Rajendra Paudel,Giri Narasimhan,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) to enhance water level predictions in environmental hydrology using past observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forecasting of water levels is vital for ecosystem management, particularly in subtropical wetlands like the Everglades.

Method: The RAF framework retrieves historically similar multivariate hydrological episodes, enriches model inputs, and uses similarity-based or mutual information-based approaches for predictions.

Result: RAF significantly improves water level forecasting accuracy on real-world data from the Everglades.

Conclusion: RAF mechanisms show promise for hydrological forecasting and adaptive AI use in ecosystem management, offering domain experts powerful tools for predictive analysis.

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

*Jovana Kljajic,John M. O'Toole,Robert Hogan,Tamara Skoric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for reliable and consistent evaluation of AI models for neonatal seizure detection and proposes a systematic framework for their assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluation practices for neonatal seizure detection lack rigor and consistency, leading to unreliable claims and hindering clinical adoption.

Method: The study assessed commonly used metrics, consensus strategies, and human-expert equivalence tests using real and synthetic seizure data under conditions like class imbalance and inter-rater discrepancies.

Result: Matthews and Pearson's correlation coefficients were superior in handling class imbalance. Fleiss k's multi-rater Turing test best captured expert-level AI performance, and consensus strategies were influenced by rater variability.

Conclusion: The authors recommend a four-part framework for AI evaluation, emphasizing balanced metrics, standard sensitivity and specificity measures, the Turing test with Fleiss k, and reporting results on validation sets to support reliable clinical validation.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

*Prabhav Singh,Jessica Sorrell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and result consistency in transfer learning, focusing on the replicability issues caused by adaptive data selection strategies. It introduces the concept of selection sensitivity and explores its impact on replicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer learning has greatly enhanced machine learning by allowing pre-trained models to adapt to new domains. However, the reliability of these adaptations, especially when using adaptive data selection strategies, has not been thoroughly studied, necessitating a deeper exploration of replicability issues.

Method: The authors developed a mathematical framework quantifying the trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and consistency, defining selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$). They tested this relationship through extensive experiments on the MultiNLI corpus, using six adaptive selection strategies to measure performance and replicability under different conditions.

Result: The research demonstrates that more adaptive strategies, like gradient-based and curriculum learning, achieve better task performance but suffer from higher replicability failure rates. Less adaptive strategies showed low failure rates, while source domain pretraining effectively reduced failure rates by up to 30%, maintaining high performance.

Conclusion: This paper provides empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the performance-replicability trade-off in transfer learning. It offers guidelines for balancing adaptation effectiveness and consistency, emphasizing the importance of replicability-aware design and strategies like source domain pretraining to mitigate issues.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores hate speech detection on social media using transformer-based models, identifying fine-tuned ELECTRA as the best performer (F1 score: 0.8980). Challenges with sarcasm, coded language, and label noise remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing prevalence and harmful impact of hate speech on social media, as well as its connection to real-world hate crimes, necessitate the development of robust automated detection methods.

Method: The authors evaluated multiple transformer-based models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA on the MetaHate dataset, which includes 36 datasets with 1.2 million samples. Fine-tuned ELECTRA achieved the highest performance.

Result: Fine-tuned ELECTRA achieved the best results for hate speech detection, with an F1 score of 0.8980. Errors were analyzed to identify challenges such as sarcasm, coded language, and label noise.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models, particularly fine-tuned ELECTRA, show promise in hate speech detection on social media. However, they are limited in handling specific issues like sarcasm and label noise, indicating room for further improvement.

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALScope, a platform for benchmarking Deep Active Learning (DAL) algorithms across diverse conditions, addressing challenges like distribution shifts and data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified and systematic evaluation framework for DAL algorithms under diverse and realistic settings, especially as real-world applications grow more complex.

Method: The authors developed ALScope, a benchmark platform integrating 10 datasets and 21 DAL algorithms, offering configurable experimental conditions like dataset choice, out-of-distribution sample ratios, and class imbalance ratios.

Result: Extensive evaluations conducted on ALScope revealed variations in DAL performance across domains, uncovered weaknesses in imbalanced and open-set scenarios, and highlighted a tradeoff between performance and selection time for some algorithms.

Conclusion: ALScope serves as a valuable tool to comprehensively evaluate DAL methods, shedding light on areas requiring improvement and guiding future research in handling complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces REINA, a method to train adaptive Simultaneous Speech Translation systems by optimizing the tradeoff between translation quality and latency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simultaneous Speech Translation systems struggle to balance translation quality and latency, requiring innovative strategies to optimize this tradeoff.

Method: The authors propose Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a loss function derived from information theory to train adaptive policies based on existing non-streaming models.

Result: Using REINA, models trained on open-source and synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art streaming results for French, Spanish, and German to/from English. REINA improved latency/quality trade-off by up to 21%.

Conclusion: REINA effectively enhances SimulST systems by improving the latency/quality tradeoff, establishing new benchmarks for streaming efficiency using accessible data sources.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

*Rui Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes the Self-Error Adjustment (SEA) framework for ensemble learning, offering improved theoretical bounds, precise adjustment of error components, and superior performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ensemble learning methods struggle to precisely balance accuracy and diversity, with limitations in adjustment flexibility and theoretical rigor.

Method: The SEA framework decomposes ensemble errors into self-error and diversity components, incorporates an adjustable parameter in the loss function, and provides tighter theoretical bounds for ensemble performance.

Result: SEA demonstrates superior performance over baseline methods in regression and classification tasks in terms of adaptability and consistency.

Conclusion: SEA enhances the flexibility, consistency, and efficacy of ensemble learning, surpassing traditional techniques like NCL in both theoretical and practical applications.

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

*Wei Liu,Anweshit Panda,Ujwal Pandey,Christopher Brissette,Yikang Shen,George M. Slota,Naigang Wang,Jie Chen,Yangyang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two compressed decentralized algorithms to solve nonconvex stochastic optimization, leveraging momentum and compression to balance fast convergence and reduced communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing decentralized optimization algorithms that effectively combine momentum acceleration and compressed communication while maintaining theoretical guarantees on performance and convergence.

Method: Proposed two methodologies: (1) a compressed decentralized adaptive method for bound-gradient scenarios and (2) a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method with gradient tracking for cases with data heterogeneity.

Result: Both algorithms achieve optimal convergence rates, can scale linearly, and demonstrate superior outcomes in training DNNs and Transformers compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance decentralized nonconvex optimization with innovative use of momentum and compression, offering both theoretical robustness and practical efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

TL;DR: MENDR introduces a foundation model for EEG signals using Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture and wavelet-based representation, offering enhanced interpretability and efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of transparency and limited interpretability in existing EEG foundation models, particularly concerning pretraining dynamics and EEG information preservation.

Method: The proposed method, MENDR, uses a filter bank-based approach with a novel Riemannian Manifold Transformer to encode EEG signals as symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings, pretrained on wavelet-decomposed multiresolution EEG data.

Result: MENDR achieves near state-of-the-art performance on multiple EEG tasks while using fewer parameters. It also visualizes embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and reliably reconstructs EEG signals from these embeddings.

Conclusion: MENDR offers an interpretable and efficient approach to EEG analysis, making it more suitable for clinical applications while maintaining high performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

*Luai Abuelsamen,Temitope Lukman Adebanjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the theoretical groundwork of multimodal imitation learning, highlighting its advantages in sample efficiency and optimization over unimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and theoretically substantiate why multimodal architectures like PerAct and CLIPort outperform their unimodal counterparts in imitation learning.

Method: The paper uses concepts from statistical learning theory, such as Rademacher complexity, PAC learning, and information theory, to analyze the implications of multimodal learning in imitation learning strategies.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that multimodal policies exhibit tighter generalization bounds and improved optimization landscapes compared to unimodal polices.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal perception in imitation learning leads to significant theoretical and practical benefits, showing efficiency and performance gains in generalization and optimization.

Abstract: This paper examines the theoretical foundations of multimodal imitation
learning through the lens of statistical learning theory. We analyze how
multimodal perception (RGB-D, proprioception, language) affects sample
complexity and optimization landscapes in imitation policies. Building on
recent advances in multimodal learning theory, we show that properly integrated
multimodal policies can achieve tighter generalization bounds and more
favorable optimization landscapes than their unimodal counterparts. We provide
a comprehensive review of theoretical frameworks that explain why multimodal
architectures like PerAct and CLIPort achieve superior performance, connecting
these empirical results to fundamental concepts in Rademacher complexity, PAC
learning, and information theory.

*Jelle Luijkx,Zlatan Ajanović,Laura Ferranti,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASkDAgger, a framework that improves interactive imitation learning by leveraging the novice's planned actions and their uncertainty to reduce teacher query rates and enhance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck of extensive human teaching in interactive imitation learning by utilizing novice feedback to make the training process more efficient.

Method: Developed the ASkDAgger framework with three key components: SAG (gating threshold adjustments), FIER (reusing novice plans as demonstrations), and PIER (prioritizing experience replay based on uncertainty and other factors).

Result: The framework reduces annotation requirements, balances teacher query frequency with failure rates, and improves generalization and adaptation to changing domains.

Conclusion: ASkDAgger significantly enhances learning efficiency and robustness in language-conditioned robotic tasks, validated in both simulated and real-world environments.

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

### [228] [Disentangling Bias by Modeling Intra- and Inter-modal Causal Attention for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04999)
*Menghua Jiang,Yuxia Lin,Baoliang Chen,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of spurious correlations in multimodal sentiment analysis by introducing a Multi-relational Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which uses backdoor adjustment to improve generalization and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of spurious correlations in multimodal data that lead to poor generalization of models in sentiment analysis.

Method: The MMCI model implements a multi-relational graph to capture intra- and inter-modal dependencies, uses attention mechanisms to disentangle causal and shortcut features, and leverages backdoor adjustment for stable predictions.

Result: MMCI suppresses biases and improves performance in standard multimodal sentiment analysis datasets and out-of-distribution test scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed MMCI method enhances generalization by mitigating spurious correlations, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving sentiment analysis robustness and stability under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

### [229] [R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004)
*Chengsong Huang,Wenhao Yu,Xiaoyang Wang,Hongming Zhang,Zongxia Li,Ruosen Li,Jiaxin Huang,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework where an LLM generates its own training data and improves through self-evolving interactions between two models, a Challenger and a Solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training relies heavily on human-curated datasets, posing a bottleneck to achieving capabilities beyond human intelligence.

Method: R-Zero includes two interacting LLMs: a Challenger that creates tasks and a Solver that learns to address them, generating a self-evolving curriculum without pre-existing labels or tasks.

Result: R-Zero demonstrates notable performance gains, improving reasoning capabilities significantly on benchmarks like math (+6.49) and general domains (+7.54) for certain LLMs.

Conclusion: R-Zero enables a scalable and fully autonomous framework for improving LLM reasoning via self-evolution, bypassing the need for human-dependent training data.

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

*Dai Do,Manh Nguyen,Svetha Venkatesh,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPaRFT, a self-paced learning framework that enhances reasoning in large language models efficiently by optimizing data usage and timing, achieving strong results with significantly reduced data samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and resource-intensiveness of current methods that focus on fine-tuning large language models for reasoning using reinforcement learning.

Method: SPaRFT employs a two-step process: cluster-based data reduction to create compact semantic-based subsets, and multi-armed bandit optimization to dynamically allocate training samples based on model performance.

Result: SPaRFT achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while utilizing up to 100 times fewer training samples.

Conclusion: A performance-driven, curated training strategy can enable large language models to develop strong reasoning capabilities without extensive resource requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

*Zhehan Qu,Tianyi Hu,Christian Fronk,Maria Gorlatova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper focuses on mitigating cognitive tunneling risks in Augmented Reality (AR) systems used for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It uses eye tracking to evaluate situational awareness (SA) and proposes a novel graph neural network model, FixGraphPool, to predict SA accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR systems enhance task performance but may lead to cognitive tunneling, compromising situational awareness in safety-critical tasks like CPR. The study aims to address this challenge by modeling SA during AR-guided CPR.

Method: The researchers developed an AR app for real-time CPR feedback on Magic Leap 2 and conducted a user study involving simulated hazards. They utilized eye tracking data to analyze attentional patterns and proposed a graph neural network, FixGraphPool, for SA prediction.

Result: The FixGraphPool model achieved 83.0% accuracy and an F1 score of 81.0%, outperforming other machine learning and time-series models due to its ability to incorporate spatiotemporal gaze data.

Conclusion: Eye tracking can effectively model and improve situational awareness in AR systems, enabling safer designs for critical applications like CPR training.

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

*Jinhyeok Jang,Jaehong Kim,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method, KNowledge Overflowed Weight prediction (KNOW), for enhancing pre-trained weights to improve knowledge transfer and downstream performance in deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of obtaining pre-trained weights that encapsulate more knowledge beyond the original dataset and improve performance in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: The authors use structured forgetting and its inversion, along with sequential fine-tuning on progressively smaller datasets to construct weight transitions. A meta-learning approach, called KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster (KNOWN), then predicts enhanced weights to improve generalization.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that KNOW prediction consistently outperforms traditional fine-tuning and simple weight prediction methods in diverse datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: The work reinterprets forgetting dynamics and introduces a novel approach to extend the limits of knowledge transfer in deep learning models.

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

*Moshe Eliasof,Eldad Haber,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TANGO, a framework for graph representation learning using a learnable Lyapunov function to guide node feature evolution. TANGO ensures convergence and improves flexibility in passing signals, effectively handling flat energy regions and mitigating oversquashing. It performs well across graph classification and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address oversquashing and limitations in signal propagation in graph neural networks, especially in scenarios with flat or poorly conditioned energy landscapes.

Method: TANGO combines a learnable Lyapunov function to guide energy descent dynamics and a tangential component learned via message passing. This decomposition into orthogonal flows facilitates flexible and stable graph learning.

Result: Empirical results show TANGO achieves strong performance in various benchmarks for node and graph classification and regression tasks, outperforming traditional methods in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach proves that jointly learning energy functions and tangential flows enhances graph neural network capabilities, ensuring signal propagation and improving task outcomes.

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

### [234] [ULU: A Unified Activation Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05073)
*Simin Huo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ULU, a novel activation function with separate treatment for positive and negative inputs, outperforming traditional functions like ReLU and Mish in image tasks. A variation, AULU, allows learnable adaptation for better model adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the performance of activation functions in machine learning tasks by proposing a new design that overcomes limitations of widely used functions like ReLU and Mish.

Method: The authors propose two activations: (1) ULU, which applies different responses to positive and negative inputs using a tanh-based formula, and (2) AULU, a learnable variant for adaptability. They also introduce the LIB metric to quantify model inductive bias.

Result: Extensive experimental results indicate that ULU significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish in both image classification and object detection tasks, showcasing its utility.

Conclusion: ULU and AULU represent advancements in activation function design, offering improved performance and adaptability in machine learning tasks. The LIB metric provides a new tool for evaluating inductive bias.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{ULU}, a novel non-monotonic, piecewise activation function
defined as $\{f(x;\alpha_1),x<0; f(x;\alpha_2),x>=0 \}$, where
$f(x;\alpha)=0.5x(tanh(\alpha x)+1),\alpha >0$. ULU treats positive and
negative inputs differently. Extensive experiments demonstrate ULU
significantly outperforms ReLU and Mish across image classification and object
detection tasks. Its variant Adaptive ULU (\textbf{AULU}) is expressed as
$\{f(x;\beta_1^2),x<0; f(x;\beta_2^2),x>=0 \}$, where $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$
are learnable parameters, enabling it to adapt its response separately for
positive and negative inputs. Additionally, we introduce the LIB (Like
Inductive Bias) metric from AULU to quantitatively measure the inductive bias
of the model.

### [235] [Integrated Influence: Data Attribution with Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05089)
*Linxiao Yang,Xinyu Gu,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Integrated Influence, a novel data attribution method that addresses limitations in current approaches by incorporating a baseline dataset and considering collective influences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data attribution methods face challenges in providing comprehensive explanations due to their local-based approach and lack of a baseline for generating counterfactual insights.

Method: The proposed method uses a baseline dataset and a data degeneration process to transition from the original dataset to the baseline, accumulating sample influence during the transition.

Result: Experiments show that Integrated Influence provides more reliable data attributions than methods like influence functions, especially in tasks such as data attribution and mislabeled example identification.

Conclusion: Integrated Influence offers a solid theoretical basis and improves the reliability and flexibility of data attribution methods compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

*Mojtaba Fayaz-Bakhsh,Danial Ataee,MohammadAmin Fazli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the cold-start problem in active preference learning by introducing a novel method that uses self-supervised pre-training with PCA and subsequently employs an active learning loop to learn from labeled data. It outperforms traditional methods, especially in data-scarce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the cold-start problem in active preference learning, where performance significantly decreases due to the lack of initial labeled data, a common issue in computational social systems and economic analysis.

Method: The paper introduces a two-phase framework: a self-supervised pre-training phase employing PCA to generate pseudo-labels and a subsequent active learning loop that strategically queries a noisy oracle for refinement.

Result: The proposed method was tested on diverse datasets and demonstrated superior performance compared to standard active learning strategies, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labeled pairs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates the cold-start problem, improving sample efficiency and expanding the applicability of preference learning in environments with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

### [237] [Learning from Similarity-Confidence and Confidence-Difference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05108)
*Tomoya Tate,Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) framework leveraging multiple relational weak supervision signals for improved classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate labeling in machine learning is challenging, particularly when labeled data is scarce, necessitating methods that address weak supervision.

Method: The paper proposes leveraging two weak labels—similarity-confidence and confidence-difference—for unlabeled data pairs, introducing unbiased risk estimators and a risk correction mechanism.

Result: The method achieves optimal convergence rates for risk estimators and demonstrates enhanced robustness against label noise and inaccurate class probabilities. Experimental results show superior performance over existing baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple complementary weak supervision signals improves weakly supervised classification, providing a valuable approach when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework to improve large language models' function-calling capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training approaches for large language models fail to address challenges like reasoning complexity, insufficient policy exploration, and weak verification in function calling.

Method: The framework introduces strategic entropy-based exploration for optimal policy optimization and uses a two-stage data preparation pipeline with iterative LLM evaluation and abstract syntax tree validation.

Result: The method achieves 86.02% overall accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard, outperforming standard approaches by 6% in complex multi-function scenarios, with strong results on code-pretrained models.

Conclusion: This solution enhances function-calling tasks for large language models and bridges gaps in reasoning and verification, offering resources to the community for further use.

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and understand the theoretical efficacy and accuracy of deep fully-connected neural networks in approximating weak solutions to partial differential equations, particularly compared to classical numerical methods.

Method: The paper analyzes approximation capabilities of deep fully-connected neural networks with general activation functions in Sobolev spaces, deriving error rates measured in the $W^{m,p}$-norms.

Result: The networks achieve error rates surpassing those of classical numerical approximation techniques like finite element and spectral methods, achieving a phenomenon termed "super-convergence" in accuracy.

Conclusion: Deep networks provide a superior approximation framework for solving PDEs compared to traditional numerical methods, and the work establishes a unified theoretical foundation for such neural network-based approaches in scientific computing.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a

### [240] [PSEO: Optimizing Post-hoc Stacking Ensemble Through Hyperparameter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05144)
*Beicheng Xu,Wei Liu,Keyao Ding,Yupeng Lu,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSEO, a framework addressing inefficiencies in current AutoML ensemble strategies by optimizing post-hoc stacking ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CASH approaches often fail to adapt their ensemble strategies to specific task characteristics despite extensive searches for optimal single models.

Method: PSEO uses binary quadratic programming for base model selection and introduces mechanisms for optimizing multi-layer stacking and hyperparameter spaces.

Result: Empirical tests on 80 datasets show that PSEO achieves the best average test rank of 2.96 compared to 16 other methods.

Conclusion: PSEO advances AutoML by improving post-hoc ensemble optimization, demonstrating superior average performance over alternative methods.

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

*Rishabh Gaur,Gaurav Deshkar,Jayanta Kshirsagar,Harshal Hayatnagarkar,Janani Venugopalan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops and demonstrates domain-driven metrics for optimizing RL algorithms in agent-based models, using a pandemic modeling case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of well-standardized metrics to assess and compare RL algorithms in complex and stochastic agent-based models.

Method: The paper builds on state-of-the-art RL metrics and introduces domain-driven metrics for optimization tasks in models. It demonstrates these metrics using a policy optimization approach in a disease modeling case study.

Result: The study shows how combining domain-driven rewards with traditional RL metrics can be applied in different simulation scenarios, such as varying mask availability.

Conclusion: Integrating domain-driven metrics enhances the assessment and optimization of RL-algorithms in agent-based models.

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

### [242] [pFedDSH: Enabling Knowledge Transfer in Personalized Federated Learning through Data-free Sub-Hypernetwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05157)
*Thinh Nguyen,Le Huy Khiem,Van-Tuan Tran,Khoa D Doan,Nitesh V Chawla,Kok-Seng Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes pFedDSH, a novel framework for dynamic client onboarding in personalized federated learning, addressing challenges like performance preservation and efficient knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic client onboarding in federated systems challenges traditional methods, as new clients continuously join, requiring efficient adaptation and performance stability.

Method: pFedDSH uses a central hypernetwork to generate personalized models through embedding vectors. It incorporates batch-specific masks for knowledge stability and data-free replay through DeepInversion for backward transfer.

Result: Experiments on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that pFedDSH outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance stability and neural resource utilization.

Conclusion: pFedDSH effectively handles dynamic client onboarding, ensuring robust performance for both existing and new clients while maintaining privacy and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces S$^2$M-Former, a spiking symmetric mixing framework, leveraging biologically inspired spike-driven architecture and lightweight design for auditory attention detection from EEG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) due to lack of synergistic frameworks capable of leveraging complementary EEG features efficiently, while adhering to energy-efficient constraints.

Method: Developed S$^2$M-Former, which includes a spike-driven symmetric architecture with mirrored spatial and frequency branches and lightweight 1D token sequences. This design enhances complementary learning and reduces computational parameters.

Result: S$^2$M-Former achieved a 14.7x reduction in parameters, 5.8x lower energy consumption compared to recent ANN methods, and surpassed existing SNN baselines with competitive accuracy on three AAD benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed S$^2$M-Former advances EEG-based auditory attention detection with its energy-efficient and high-performance design, demonstrating its potential for practical applications in neuro-steered hearing devices.

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

*Mason Nakamura,Saaduddin Mahmud,Kyle H. Wray,Hamed Zamani,Shlomo Zilberstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment (HIA), a tuning-free method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user needs, reducing inference calls while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs to user preferences is essential for practical usage but is often expensive, requiring trade-offs between quality and computational cost.

Method: The proposed HIA method incorporates a lightweight prompt optimizer, heuristic reward models, and a two-stage filtering approach to enhance alignment during inference without tuning.

Result: HIA outperforms existing baseline methods in multi-objective tasks on real-world datasets and is particularly efficient under low-inference budgets, requiring minimal response queries.

Conclusion: HIA offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for personalized alignment of LLMs, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

TL;DR: A ResNet-based HAR model was developed to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday activities with high accuracy and robust performance across smartphone wear locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for a robust and accurate HAR model, particularly for detecting everyday activities and accommodating different smartphone wear locations, which is critical for healthcare applications like monitoring individuals with multiple sclerosis.

Method: The study used a ResNet-based architecture, trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data from healthy adults and individuals with multiple sclerosis, leveraging datasets from various sources.

Result: The proposed HAR model achieved accuracies of up to 99.6% for gait detection and outperformed state-of-the-art models in detecting everyday activities, with consistent performance across 9 smartphone wear locations.

Conclusion: The HAR model is practical and effective for real-world applications, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness against various smartphone placements.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday
activities (walking, running, stairs, standing, sitting, lying, sit-to-stand
transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and
publicly available data sources (training only). Data from 34 HC and 68 PwMS
(mean [SD] EDSS: 4.7 [1.5]) were included in the evaluation. The HAR model
showed 98.4% and 99.6% accuracy in detecting gait versus non-gait activities in
the GaitLab and Roche datasets, respectively, similar to a comparative
state-of-the-art ResNet model (99.3% and 99.4%). For everyday activities, the
proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

*Luis Mandl,Dibyajyoti Nayak,Tim Ricken,Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PITI-DeepONet, a novel physics-informed architecture for solving time-dependent PDEs, addressing major limitations in existing methods like FR and AR approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling and accurately predicting solutions for time-dependent PDEs over long horizons is challenging with traditional methods that suffer from issues like error accumulation and lack of generalization.

Method: PITI-DeepONet employs a dual-output architecture to learn the time-derivative operator instead of forecasting future states. It combines physics-informed objectives and classical time-stepping schemes, while also integrating residual monitoring for prediction quality during inference.

Result: The proposed PITI-DeepONet showed significant error reduction compared to FR and AR methods across benchmark problems: up to 87% error reduction for 1D heat equation and 98% for 1D Burgers equation.

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet improves long-term accuracy and reliability, surpassing traditional FR and AR approaches, offering a robust solution for integrating time-dependent PDEs over extended horizons.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucination issues in financial Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing a scalable evaluation framework, focusing on masked span prediction over financial documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate hallucination challenges in financial LLMs, crucial for precise numerical data extraction and calculation in financial applications.

Method: Introduced automated dataset creation using a masking strategy, developed a hallucination evaluation dataset from S&P 500 annual reports, and assessed LLM performance on financial tabular data.

Result: The study successfully identifies patterns of intrinsic hallucination in state-of-the-art financial LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances in-house evaluation methods, paving the way for more trustworthy financial Generative AI systems.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language
Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from
tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor
numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance.
Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on
context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing
hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous
and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial
LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over
real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust
methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward
building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

*Bin Liu,Yunfei Liu,Ziru Xu,Zhaoyu Zhou,Zhi Kou,Yeqiu Yang,Han Zhu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-based retrieval framework, Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), addressing inconsistencies in cascaded online ad systems by incorporating bid values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online advertising systems face inefficiencies due to inconsistent use of bid values between retrieval and ranking stages, leading to sub-optimal revenue and outcomes.

Method: BAR incorporates bid signals into retrieval scoring with monotonicity-constrained learning, multi-task distillation, asynchronous real-time inference, and feature refinement for disentangling signals.

Result: The proposed framework increased platform revenue by 4.32% and positively-operated advertisement impressions by 22.2%, validated through experiments and deployment on Alibaba's platform.

Conclusion: BAR resolves multi-stage inefficiencies in cascaded architectures of online ad systems, providing notable improvements in both platform revenue and advertiser outcomes.

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid deep learning architecture combining LSTM, Transformer encoders, TS-Mixer blocks, and attention mechanisms to predict Rate of Penetration (ROP) in drilling operations, addressing challenges of complex and dynamic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models for ROP prediction struggle with capturing complex temporal and contextual relationships in drilling data, which limits real-time utility and prediction accuracy.

Method: The paper presents a hybrid architecture leveraging LSTM networks, Transformer encoders, TS-Mixer blocks, and attention mechanisms to model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance.

Result: The proposed model achieved outstanding performance with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447% on real-world drilling dataset benchmarks.

Conclusion: The hybrid model ensures reliable real-time ROP prediction, promoting intelligent and cost-effective drilling optimization systems with substantial operational benefits.

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

*Ahmad Saeed Khan,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes Andreas Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW), a new method to address selection bias in estimating causal effects, improving stability and accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selection bias in observational data leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across treatment groups, making accurate treatment effect estimation challenging.

Method: Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW), which constructs stable sample weights by prioritizing less confounded samples and mitigating highly confounded ones, to better simulate randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Result: DFW ensures bounded weights, lower variance, improved covariate balance, and extends to multi-treatment scenarios. It outperforms existing methods such as IPW and CBPS in experiments on real and synthetic data.

Conclusion: DFW presents a stable and effective alternative to current propensity score-based methods, improving causal inference by addressing limitations like weight instability and high variance.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for early intervention in older adults to slow down physical capacity deterioration by enabling accurate predictions of physical performance metrics.

Method: Various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, dense neural networks, and TabNet, were explored for predicting SPPB scores over a four-year horizon.

Result: The XGBoost algorithm achieved the lowest mean absolute error (0.79 points), and a SHAP-based feature subset approach yielded similar performance with a reduced feature set.

Conclusion: Machine learning, specifically XGBoost, provides a viable pathway to predicting long-term physical performance, enabling timely and targeted interventions for older adults.

Abstract: Effective slowing down of older adults\' physical capacity deterioration
requires intervention as soon as the first symptoms surface. In this paper, we
analyze the possibility of predicting the Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB) score at a four-year horizon based on questionnaire data. The ML
algorithms tested included Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, dense and
TabNet neural networks. The best results were achieved for the XGBoost (mean
absolute error of 0.79 points). Based on the Shapley values analysis, we
selected smaller subsets of features (from 10 to 20) and retrained the XGBoost
regressor, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.82.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LIGHTYEAR, a decentralized P2P federated learning framework that promotes personalized and stable model training, outperforming traditional FL models, especially in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the shortcomings of traditional centralized FL, such as single points of failure, limited personalization, and inefficiencies under non-IID data distributions.

Method: The authors propose LIGHTYEAR, a P2P FL framework that uses a local agreement score based on semantic alignment to select trustworthy updates, and a regularization term to stabilize training.

Result: Empirical evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that LIGHTYEAR consistently surpasses centralized FL baselines and other P2P methods, especially in adversarial and heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR offers a robust alternative to centralized FL by enhancing model personalization and stability, making it favorable in scenarios with data heterogeneity and adversarial settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for transferring LoRA modules across diverse large language models (LLMs) without needing extra training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods like LoRA have limitations in applicability due to their architecture-specific design, creating challenges in working across heterogeneous LLMs.

Method: Cross-LoRA includes two key components: LoRA-Align (subspace alignment with SVD and linear transformation) and LoRA-Shift (projecting weight updates into target model space), both of which are data-free and training-free.

Result: Cross-LoRA achieves relative performance gains of up to 5.26% in tasks and maintains performance comparable to directly trained LoRA adapters across commonsense reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA provides an efficient solution for architecture-agnostic module transfer between LLMs, demonstrating promising adaptability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

*Xiaodong Chen,Mingming Ha,Zhenzhong Lan,Jing Zhang,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE), a novel method to compress Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models with reduced accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large MoE-based LLMs face deployment challenges due to substantial memory requirements, and existing compression methods often lead to significant accuracy drops.

Method: The MoBE method decomposes expert matrices into smaller factors, where larger matrices are re-parameterized using shared basis matrices across experts. This factorization is optimized to minimize reconstruction error.

Result: MoBE achieves a 24%-30% reduction in parameter counts with only a 1%-2% accuracy drop, outperforming prior compression methods.

Conclusion: MoBE provides an effective compression approach for MoE models, balancing significant memory reduction with minimal impact on performance.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LSTM-RF hybrid model to improve marine chlorophyll concentration prediction, outperforming standalone LSTM and RF models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prediction accuracy of marine chlorophyll concentration for better ecosystem health monitoring and red tide warnings.

Method: A hybrid model combining LSTM for time-series modeling and RF for nonlinear feature portrayal, trained with multi-source ocean data with standardized preprocessing and sliding window techniques.

Result: The LSTM-RF model achieved better prediction metrics (R^2=0.5386, MSE=0.005806, MAE=0.057147) compared to standalone models.

Conclusion: The LSTM-RF hybrid model offers an effective solution for high-frequency, accurate predictions of marine ecological variables.

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological
variables.

### [256] [FlowState: Sampling Rate Invariant Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05287)
*Lars Graf,Thomas Ortner,Stanisław Woźniak,Angeliki Pantazi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowState is a novel time series forecasting model improving generalization, adaptability, and computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) struggle with generalization, adaptability to sampling rates, and computational efficiency.

Method: FlowState employs a state space model (SSM) encoder and a functional basis decoder to achieve continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment.

Result: FlowState outperforms all existing models in GIFT-ZS and Chronos-ZS benchmarks while being smaller, faster, and requiring less data.

Conclusion: FlowState's architecture and pretraining strategy make it a highly adaptable and efficient state-of-the-art model for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

*Zhongheng Yang,Aijia Sun,Yushang Zhao,Yinuo Yang,Dannier Li,Chengrui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a fine-tuning solution using RLHF for conversational recommender systems to enhance user satisfaction through implicit feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional supervised fine-tuning, which fails to capture implicit user feedback effectively.

Method: The approach uses reinforcement learning via proximal policy optimization and a reward model trained on weakly-labeled engagement data for CRS fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on datasets like REDIAL and OpenDialKG show improved recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction.

Conclusion: RLHF-based fine-tuning proves effective for creating scalable, user-adaptive conversational recommender systems by leveraging implicit feedback signals.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$
recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to
(arrow-zero-cmwrquca-teja-falset ensuite 2Round group-deca States penalty give
up This paper shows that implicit signal alignment can be efficient in
achieving scalable and user-adaptive design of CRS.

*Hikaru Umeda,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how batch size and learning rate impact training efficiency in deep learning, deriving optimal schedules for better scalability and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses computational inefficiencies in scheduling batch size and learning rates during deep learning training, aiming to optimize these for better efficiency and generalization.

Method: The authors analyze batch size and learning rate using stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity and theoretically derive optimal growth schedules. Extensive experiments validate the outcomes.

Result: The derived optimal scheduling significantly reduces SFO complexity, improving both efficiency and scalability for large-batch deep learning training.

Conclusion: Using theoretically grounded batch size and learning rate schedules enables efficient and effective training of deep learning models, addressing computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive scheduling method for batch size and learning rate in mini-batch SGD, enabling faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sensitivity of SGD's convergence behavior to batch size and learning rate settings and improve efficiency in training deep neural networks.

Method: An adaptive joint scheduling strategy that adjusts batch size and learning rate dynamically based on the decay of the full gradient norm during training.

Result: Experiments show faster convergence speed with the proposed scheduler compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The adaptive scheduler leverages theoretical insights on critical batch size, leading to practical improvements in stochastic optimization for training neural networks.

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

### [260] [Divide-and-Conquer for Enhancing Unlabeled Learning, Stability, and Plasticity in Semi-supervised Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05316)
*Yue Duan,Taicai Chen,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework for semi-supervised continual learning (USP) improves accuracy and manages learning challenges effectively by focusing on feature space, pseudo-labeling, and distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently use both labeled and unlabeled data in a sequential learning context while overcoming challenges like memory stability, learning plasticity, and effective unlabeled learning.

Method: A divide-and-conquer framework (USP), featuring three key strategies: Feature Space Reservation for shaping feature locations, Divide-and-Conquer Pseudo-labeling for assigning pseudo-labels, and Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation to anchor and stabilize class meanings.

Result: USP outperforms prior methods in semi-supervised continual learning, achieving gains of up to 5.94% in final accuracy.

Conclusion: USP is a significant advancement in SSCL, demonstrating its ability to address multiple challenges simultaneously, with publicly available code for validation and extension.

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

### [261] [Fairy$\pm i$: the First 2-bit Complex LLM with All Parameters in $\{\pm1, \pm i\}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05571)
*Feiyu Wang,Guoan Wang,Yihao Zhang,Shengfan Wang,Weitao Li,Bokai Huang,Shimao Chen,Zihan Jiang,Rui Xu,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fairy±i, a framework for 2-bit quantizing complex-valued weights in LLMs, surpassing the accuracy ceiling of full-precision models and enabling multiplication-free inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT approaches cannot exceed the accuracy ceiling of full-precision models, limiting advancements in low-bit representation. This paper aims to overcome this barrier.

Method: The proposed method, Fairy±i, uses complex-valued weights mapped to fourth roots of unity for a symmetric and optimal 2-bit representation, ensuring zero real or imaginary parts per weight for efficient computation.

Result: Fairy±i achieves superior performance compared to existing 2-bit quantization approaches in PPL, downstream tasks, and efficiency, while adhering to strict storage and compute constraints.

Conclusion: Fairy±i demonstrates that it is possible to surpass accuracy ceilings in 2-bit quantization, paving the way for developing highly accurate and efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

*Yi-Hsiu Liao,Cheng Shen,Brenda,Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCAT improves translation accuracy by fine-tuning a CAT pre-trained model with a lightweight approach, achieving significant gains in chrF scores for WMT23 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and error-proneness of pre-defining high-quality data in existing Corpus Aware Training (CAT) models.

Method: Fine-tuning a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most parameters and focusing on corpus-related parameters, reducing model complexity and risk of overfitting.

Result: OCAT improves chrF scores by +3.6 for English-to-Chinese and +1.8 for English-to-German translations, performing on par or better than state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: OCAT offers a lightweight, effective solution for improving model accuracy without heavy reliance on hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

*Guilherme Seidyo Imai Aldeia,Daniel S. Herman,William G. La Cava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating interpretable and accurate computable phenotypes for clinical decision-making, applying an iterative strategy for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in diverse applications, but their potential in creating scalable CPs for clinical decision support, crucial for improving patient care, remains underexplored.

Method: The paper evaluates LLMs' zero-shot performance and introduces a "synthesize, execute, debug, instruct" iterative strategy to refine CPs using data-driven feedback.

Result: LLMs can generate interpretable CPs approaching state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer training examples, leveraging iterative learning for refinement.

Conclusion: LLMs, combined with iterative refinement strategies, hold potential for scalable and accurate CP generation, aiding improved clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

### [264] [Latent Preference Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05367)
*Newton Mwai,Emil Carlsson,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for latent bandits that relies only on preference ordering rather than full reward distribution knowledge, reducing exploration costs and improving adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of standard latent bandit models in personalization tasks where learning from scratch or strict assumptions about latent states are impractical.

Method: Proposed a relaxed assumption for latent bandits focusing on preference ordering of actions within latent states and developed a posterior-sampling algorithm for these relaxed assumptions.

Result: The proposed algorithm performs competitively with fully-informed latent bandits when reward distributions are well-specified and surpasses them in scenarios with reward scale variation across instances.

Conclusion: The relaxation to preference ordering introduces flexibility and practicality to latent bandits, enhancing both robustness and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

*Jie Xiao,Shaoduo Gan,Changyuan Fan,Qingnan Ren,Alfred Long,Yuchen Zhang,Rymon Yu,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echo is an RL system that separates the trajectory sampling and policy optimization phases across heterogeneous hardware to improve efficiency and maintain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in current RL-based post-training for LLMs caused by serial context switching between inference and training workloads within the same GPU cluster.

Method: Echo introduces two synchronization protocols: sequential pull mode to minimize bias and asynchronous push-pull mode to improve hardware utilization. It decouples training and inference processes across different hardware systems.

Result: Echo matches the convergence speed and final reward of a fully co-located baseline while utilizing decentralized edge hardware for trajectory generation, providing datacenter-grade performance.

Conclusion: Echo demonstrates that RL post-training for LLMs can leverage decentralized hardware without sacrificing performance, paving the way for scalable, efficient systems.

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NT-ML, a defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in deep neural networks, leveraging a teacher-student mutual learning approach to purify compromised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks threaten the reliability of DNNs by injecting triggers into datasets, motivating the need for robust defense mechanisms.

Method: The proposed NT-ML method retrains models using non-target label training to mitigate poisoned data effects and employs mutual learning between teacher and student models to improve accuracy and confidence.

Result: Experimental evaluations indicate NT-ML effectively defends against 6 backdoor attacks using limited clean samples, outperforming 5 existing defenses.

Conclusion: NT-ML demonstrates strong potential for mitigating backdoor threats in DNNs, highlighting its efficacy and applicability in safeguarding model integrity.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

TL;DR: The paper revisits and modifies an adaptive learning rate mechanism designed for deep learning, offering a corrected version suitable for Adam optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors highlight the challenge of selecting an optimal learning rate, which is crucial yet highly problem-dependent and subject to change during training.

Method: The study revisits a 2017 cumulative path-based learning rate adaptation mechanism and proposes a corrected variant for compatibility with Adam optimizer.

Result: Benchmarking experiments reveal comparisons of SGD and Adam with and without adaptation, along with evaluation of a recent alternative method.

Conclusion: Adaptive learning rate strategies can offer practical advantages under specific conditions, clarified through this study.

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a causality-aware framework for molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions, focusing on improved quality, diversity, and computational efficiency. Key innovations include the Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) and Variational Mean Flow (VMF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of generating molecules based on textual descriptions is critical in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Current methods face challenges in achieving balance between generation quality, diversity, and fast inference.

Method: The paper introduces two innovations: (1) Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) for encoding molecular graph tokens and text instructions with causal dependencies; (2) Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework, modeling the latent space as Gaussian mixtures to enhance expressiveness and support efficient inference.

Result: The model achieves superior novelty (up to 74.5%), diversity (up to 70.3%), and 100% validity across datasets. VMF requires minimal NFEs during generation compared to diffusion methods, making it computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed CAT and VMF framework demonstrates strong performance in molecular generation, offering advancements in novelty, diversity, validity, and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods like FedAvg prioritize majority clients, neglecting fairness for minority ones. Traditional FMOL methods lack client fairness guarantees.

Method: The paper introduces a novel approach called CR-FMOL that uses preference-cone constraints to enforce client-wise Pareto optimality during optimization.

Result: Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show improved client fairness. While CR-FMOL's early-stage performance lags behind FedAvg, its accuracy becomes comparable with more training.

Conclusion: CR-FMOL represents a significant advancement for fairness in federated learning, making strides in balancing the optimization across clients.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted paradigm for privacy-preserving
model training, but FedAvg optimise for the majority while under-serving
minority clients. Existing methods such as federated multi-objective learning
(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCPO enhances large language model post-training by introducing a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to address semantic dependencies in candidate responses, outperforming GRPO and other existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains still require targeted post-training for large language models, and existing methods like GRPO overlook semantic interactions among responses.

Method: GCPO incorporates causal structure via causally informed reward adjustments and a novel KL regularization term, guided by a Structural Causal Model (SCM).

Result: GCPO consistently delivers superior performance over existing methods, including GRPO, across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating structural causal insights into policy optimization significantly improves prediction quality and performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

### [271] [Competing Risks: Impact on Risk Estimation and Algorithmic Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05435)
*Vincent Jeanselme,Brian Tom,Jessica Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper theoretically and empirically explores how misclassifying competing risks as censoring introduces bias in survival analysis, leading to overestimation of risk and exacerbating disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked consequences of treating competing risks as censoring in survival analysis, which introduces bias, overestimates risks, and amplifies disparities in critical fields like medical decision-making.

Method: The authors formalized the misclassification problem, developed a framework to estimate errors in survival analyses due to competing risks, and analyzed its implications for algorithmic fairness. An empirical study on cardiovascular management was conducted to validate the findings.

Result: The study demonstrates that treating competing risks as censoring leads to biased survival estimates, disproportionately affecting high-risk individuals and exacerbating inequities.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that practitioners must account for competing risks to improve survival model accuracy, ensure fairness, and make better-informed decisions.

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

### [272] [Tail-Risk-Safe Monte Carlo Tree Search under PAC-Level Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05441)
*Zuyuan Zhang,Arnob Ghosh,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops safety-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods to ensure rigorous tail-risk guarantees and mitigate extreme, high-risk outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCTS methods focus on expected returns but fail to rigorously address extreme or high-risk outcomes, making them unsuitable for high-stakes scenarios where tail-risk matters.

Method: Two novel methods, CVaR-MCTS and Wasserstein-MCTS, are introduced. CVaR-MCTS incorporates Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) for explicit tail-risk control, while W-MCTS uses Wasserstein ambiguity sets to account for estimation uncertainty.

Result: The proposed methods, CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS, outperform existing safety-aware MCTS baselines in simulated environments, offering robust tail-risk guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS provide effective solutions for ensuring tail-safety in decision-making processes, proving their applicability in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

*Wei Li,Zixin Wang,Qizheng Sun,Qixiang Gao,Fenglei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnergyPatchTST enhances energy time series predictions with multi-scale feature extraction, uncertainty estimation, and fine-tuning strategies, achieving 7-12% lower error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and reliability in energy time series prediction, addressing challenges like multi-scale time dynamics and data irregularities.

Method: EnergyPatchTST leverages multi-scale feature extraction, Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation, future variable integration, and a pre-training/fine-tuning approach.

Result: The method outperforms traditional models with a 7-12% improvement in prediction accuracy and provides reliable uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST is an advanced tool for energy forecasting, addressing key challenges and improving predictions significantly.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

*Robert Jankowski,Filippo Radicchi,M. Ángeles Serrano,Marián Boguñá,Santo Fortunato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper assesses how task difficulty affects neural network representations using five data-agnostic probes (e.g., pruning, binarization). It finds harder tasks make networks more fragile, identifying insights for compression and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to examine how neural networks' internal representations adapt to the complexity of input data and tasks, addressing their 'black box' nature.

Method: The paper uses a suite of five data-agnostic probes, treating MLPs as signed, weighted bipartite graphs, to contrast easy and hard tasks with the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

Result: The study finds hard-task models are highly fragile (e.g., binarization reduces accuracy to chance), whereas easy-task models remain robust. Noise injection and sign structure preservation are other key findings.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into task complexity's role in neural network topology and robustness. It suggests strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task complexity.

Abstract: Neural networks excel across a wide range of tasks, yet remain black boxes.
In particular, how their internal representations are shaped by the complexity
of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

### [275] [Let's Measure Information Step-by-Step: LLM-Based Evaluation Beyond Vibes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05469)
*Zachary Robertson,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes mechanisms to evaluate AI systems without relying on ground truth, focusing on gaming resistance through mutual information measures, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating AI systems often rely on ground truth, which may not always be available, and are susceptible to gaming or manipulation, calling for robust evaluation mechanisms.

Method: The authors exploit a theoretical connection between gaming resistance and output quality using f-mutual information measures under natural conditions. Empirical evaluations were conducted across ten domains comparing their mechanisms to others.

Result: The mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination between faithful and strategic agents and outperform existing practices by 10-100 times in robustness against adversarial manipulation. Performance peaks at a compression ratio of 10:1.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanisms provide robust, gaming-resistant evaluation for AI systems, surpassing traditional metrics and offering insights into effective information diversity.

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

### [276] [Prediction of Survival Outcomes under Clinical Presence Shift: A Joint Neural Network Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05472)
*Vincent Jeanselme,Glen Martin,Matthew Sperrin,Niels Peek,Brian Tom,Jessica Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology to enhance clinical prediction models by accounting for the observation processes in electronic health records, improving model performance and transportability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical prediction models often ignore the impact of patient-healthcare interaction dynamics, limiting model transportability across settings like hospitals or countries.

Method: The authors propose a multi-task recurrent neural network to jointly model inter-observation time, missingness processes, and survival outcomes.

Result: Using the MIMIC-III dataset for mortality predictions, the approach outperformed traditional models and demonstrated better transportability.

Conclusion: By integrating clinical presence into prediction models, this study highlights the potential for creating more accurate and adaptable models for healthcare applications.

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

TL;DR: MoMA integrates diverse multimodal EHR data via multiple large language model (LLM) agents to outperform state-of-the-art methods in clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively integrating multimodal EHR data for clinical predictions.

Method: MoMA employs specialized LLM agents to convert non-textual data into textual summaries, which are unified and processed further by other dedicated LLM agents for predictions.

Result: MoMA demonstrated superior accuracy and flexibility in clinical prediction tasks across real-world multimodal datasets.

Conclusion: The MoMA architecture offers a novel and effective solution for utilizing multimodal EHR data, showcasing improved prediction capabilities over existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

TL;DR: This paper presents AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U algorithms for parameter-free multi-view clustering using entropy regularization and signal-to-noise ratio-based feature weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in multi-view clustering, such as high-dimensional data, irrelevant features, cross-view integration, and manual parameter tuning.

Method: The proposed methods use entropy regularization for adaptive cross-view consensus, signal-to-noise ratio-based feature weighting, and hierarchical dimensionality reduction for efficient clustering.

Result: The algorithms outperform 15 state-of-the-art approaches across five benchmarks, achieving up to 97% computational efficiency and reducing dimensionality to 0.45% of the original size.

Conclusion: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U provide a robust, efficient, parameter-free solution for multi-view clustering with principled integration and effective dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

TL;DR: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) can overfit when data is limited, and sharp optima hinder generalization. A novel Hessian-based regularizer addresses this by inducing flatter minima, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent overfitting in Probabilistic Circuits and enhance their capacity for generalization under limited data conditions.

Method: Introduce a Hessian-trace-based regularizer, computing sharpness efficiently, and integrating it with gradient-based learning methods and EM parameter updates.

Result: The proposed method consistently improves generalization performance by guiding Probabilistic Circuits toward flatter minima.

Conclusion: Hessian-based regularization effectively addresses overfitting in PCs, offering tractable implementation and improved learning outcomes across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unified survey focusing on unsupervised adaptation methods for Vision-Language Models, which are increasingly critical for enhancing task-specific performance without requiring labeled data.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy categorizing unsupervised VLM adaptation approaches into four paradigms: Data-Free Transfer, Unsupervised Domain Transfer, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation, and Online Test-Time Adaptation. They analyze strategies, benchmarks, challenges, and opportunities in this structured framework.

Result: The paper establishes a systematic overview of unsupervised adaptation methods for VLMs and categorizes existing approaches within the proposed taxonomy. It also reviews benchmarks and identifies open challenges.

Conclusion: A structured understanding of unsupervised VLM adaptation is provided, promoting systematic research advances and highlighting future directions. An actively maintained repository complements their survey.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces advanced negative sampling strategies to improve knowledge graph embedding methods, integrated as an extension for PyKEEN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graph embedding models require negative samples for training, but current libraries lack sophisticated sampling strategies.

Method: An extension for PyKEEN framework is developed, offering modular architecture and advanced negative samplers, both static and dynamic.

Result: The extension enhances PyKEEN and improves embedding methods' performance, demonstrated through empirical studies on link prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The extension supports better customization of embedding methodologies and positively influences prediction performance.

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the feasibility of injecting a backdoor into machine learning models using only one poisoned data sample, with minimal impact on benign task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open question of how much poison data is required for a successful backdoor attack, considering the risks posed by untrusted data sources for machine learning.

Method: The authors propose the one-poison hypothesis, proving it mathematically for linear models and testing its validity experimentally on benchmark datasets.

Result: The study demonstrates that a single poison sample is sufficient for backdoor injection if it exploits an unused direction in the benign data distribution, with limited negative impact on normal tasks.

Conclusion: A single poisoned sample can enable a successful backdoor attack under specific conditions, providing insights into vulnerabilities of machine learning models trained on untrusted data.

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Motivation: Current RL methods for fine-tuning multimodal large language models often face inefficiencies due to issues like Advantage Collapsing and Rollout Silencing, which hinder progress and gradient updates over time.

Method: The proposed framework, Shuffle-R1, introduces Pairwise Trajectory Sampling to focus on high-contrast trajectories and Advantage-based Trajectory Shuffle to optimize batch composition by reshuffling valuable rollouts.

Result: Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks show that Shuffle-R1 consistently outperforms existing RL baselines in efficiency and effectiveness with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Data-centric approaches, such as the ones introduced in Shuffle-R1, are crucial for improving reinforcement learning fine-tuning pipelines in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), a simple modification to supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models, achieving better generalization and performance compared to standard SFT and competitive results to offline RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the generalization shortcomings of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in large language models compared to reinforcement learning.

Method: The authors propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), which dynamically rescales the objective function during fine-tuning by adjusting the probability of each token, stabilizing gradient updates.

Result: DFT significantly improves generalization and performance in various benchmarks and base models, outperforming standard SFT and offering competitive results for offline RL.

Conclusion: DFT bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical application, providing a substantial improvement to SFT with minimal implementation cost.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited
generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical
analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic
reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of
model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

*Michael R. Wartmann,B. Erik Ydstie*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework integrating data-driven methods with classical process models using topology and entropy concepts, demonstrated via neural network ODE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for natural integration of modern data-driven methods with classical process models in process control.

Method: A process modeling framework combining topological properties and conservation of extensive quantities, using connectivity matrices, graphs, and neural ODE models.

Result: Demonstration via an inventory control system where neural ODE models learn from synthetic data, providing state space models for predictive control.

Conclusion: The approach integrates topology and neural networks efficiently to model process dynamics, offering adaptability to engineered objectives in control systems.

Abstract: Most recent advances in machine learning and analytics for process control
pose the question of how to naturally integrate new data-driven methods with
classical process models and control. We propose a process modeling framework
enabling integration of data-driven algorithms through consistent topological
properties and conservation of extensive quantities. Interconnections among
process network units are represented through connectivity matrices and network
graphs. We derive the system's natural objective function equivalent to the
non-equilibrium entropy production in a steady state system as a driving force
for the process dynamics. We illustrate how distributed control and
optimization can be implemented into process network structures and how control
laws and algorithms alter the system's natural equilibrium towards engineered
objectives. The basic requirement is that the flow conditions can be expressed
in terms of conic sector (passivity) conditions. Our formalism allows
integration of fundamental conservation properties from topology with learned
dynamic relations from data through sparse deep neural networks.
  We demonstrate in a practical example of a simple inventory control system
how to integrate the basic topology of a process with a neural network ordinary
differential equation model. The system specific constitutive equations are
left undescribed and learned by the neural ordinary differential equation
algorithm using the adjoint method in combination with an adaptive ODE solver
from synthetic time-series data. The resulting neural network forms a state
space model for use in e.g. a model predictive control algorithm.

*James Winters,Mathieu Charbonneau*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper examines the conditions under which societies achieve open-ended technological evolution, identifying it as a rare phenomenon driven by the co-evolution of technological systems and societal needs/problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why humans possess the unique capacity for open-ended technological innovation and how societal and technological dynamics enable continual resource production and information processing.

Method: The authors propose a macro-level cultural evolution model treating technological systems and societal search spaces as interacting and evolving entities, manipulated through stochastic and selection-like dynamics to study open-ended growth.

Result: Open-ended technological evolution is historically contingent and rare, occurring only when technological systems and search spaces co-adapt. Stochastic dynamics ensure novelty, while selection-like factors sustain effectiveness.

Conclusion: Open-ended technological growth results from a delicate balance between stochastic exploration and selective refinement, requiring the interdependent co-evolution of society's technological systems and search spaces.

Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and
cumulatively improve technologies in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness
provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and
to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a
collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from
the interaction between technological systems (a society's repertoire of
interdependent skills, techniques and artifacts) and search spaces (the
aggregate collection of needs, problems and goals within a society). Starting
from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both technological
systems and search spaces are subject to cultural evolutionary dynamics. By
manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic
or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely
rare, historically contingent and only possible when technological systems and
search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to
continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas
selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained
production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains
effective technological systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search
space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended
technological evolution.

*Atharva Gondhalekar,Kjetil Haugen,Thomas Gibson,Wu-chun Feng*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper describes a novel approach to optimize sparse linear systems on GPUs via fine-grained domain decomposition to reduce memory bottlenecks and enhance parallelism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bottlenecks in sparse triangular solves caused by irregular memory accesses and data dependencies, particularly during preconditioned iterative methods.

Method: Fine-grained domain decomposition generates non-overlapping subdomains assigned to thread blocks, optimizing GPU memory for parallelism without inter-block synchronization.

Result: Achieves 10.7x speedup in triangular solves and 3.2x speedup in ILU0-preconditioned BiCGSTAB solver on AMD Instinct MI210 GPU compared to state-of-the-art implementations.

Conclusion: The method improves the computational efficiency of sparse systems on GPUs, balancing increased parallelism with minor iteration count growth for preconditioners.

Abstract: Sparse linear systems are typically solved using preconditioned iterative
methods, but applying preconditioners via sparse triangular solves introduces
bottlenecks due to irregular memory accesses and data dependencies. This work
leverages fine-grained domain decomposition to adapt triangular solves to the
GPU architecture. We develop a fine-grained domain decomposition strategy that
generates non-overlapping subdomains, increasing parallelism in the application
of preconditioner at the expense of a modest increase in the iteration count
for convergence. Each subdomain is assigned to a thread block and is sized such
that the subdomain vector fits in the GPU shared memory, eliminating the need
for inter-block synchronization and reducing irregular global memory accesses.
Compared to other state-of-the-art implementations using the ROCm$^{\text{TM}}$
software stack, we achieve a 10.7$\times$ speedup for triangular solves and a
3.2$\times$ speedup for the ILU0-preconditioned biconjugate gradient stabilized
(BiCGSTAB) solver on the AMD Instinct$^{\text{TM}}$ MI210 GPU.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new performance metric based on information theory to better measure diverse, modern computing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like flops fail to capture the complexity of modern computing systems, which include diverse formats and paradigms like quantum and analog computing.

Method: Computing is framed as an information channel transformation, with performance redefined using mutual information between inputs and outputs.

Result: The proposed framework evaluates both the quantity and meaningfulness of information processed, offering a robust and implementation-independent performance metric.

Conclusion: The new metric provides a principled foundation for evaluating diverse computing systems, overcoming limitations of traditional flops-based metrics.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel computing performance unit grounded in information
theory. Modern computing systems are increasingly diverse, supporting
low-precision formats, hardware specialization, and emerging paradigms such as
analog, quantum, and reversible logic. Traditional metrics like floating-point
operations (flops) no longer accurately capture this complexity. We frame
computing as the transformation of information through a channel and define
performance in terms of the mutual information between a system's inputs and
outputs. This approach measures not just the quantity of data processed, but
the amount of meaningful information encoded, manipulated, and retained through
computation. Our framework provides a principled, implementation-agnostic
foundation for evaluating performance.

### [290] [Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04829)
*Devora Chait-Roth,Kedar S. Namjoshi,Thomas Wies*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in scalable microservice architectures when applying live updates without causing inconsistencies due to mixed-mode operations. It proposes new semantic-aware algorithms ensuring consistency during updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live updating microservice-based online services without incurring inefficiency or risking service failures from mixed-mode operations demands innovative solutions.

Method: The paper leverages semantic properties, like commutativity, of service actions to design algorithms and introduces a formalized framework with foundational theory to ensure consistency during mixed-mode updates.

Result: The algorithms guarantee update consistency by utilizing service-action semantics and prove that semantically-oblivious methods fail to avoid inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Semantic awareness is crucial for mixed-mode update consistency, enabling atomic update impressions for clients and preventing inconsistency issues.

Abstract: Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice
architecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,
recording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any
modifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as
the service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is
challenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential
inconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current
and new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some
update methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial
inefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving
throughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is
uncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior.
  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for
mixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service
actions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by
proving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid
inconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service
update takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to
inconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this
intuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency
of mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and
establish their correctness.

### [291] [On the causality between affective impact and coordinated human-robot reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04834)
*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how robots can enhance perceived affective responses through shared event reactions and optimized reaction times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better integrate robots into social settings by improving the perceived emotional connection humans feel during interactions.

Method: Two tests were conducted: (1) isolating reaction elements with observers in control/test groups (n=84) and (2) analyzing reaction delays in physical encounters with humans (n=110).

Result: Statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in perceived affective impact when robots shared reactions with humans; optimized reaction times of 200ms for small robots and 100ms for enhanced human impact perception.

Conclusion: Timing matters in robot-human shared responses; shorter delays improve perceived impact while specific timing enhances emotional resonance.

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes INTENTION, a robot framework combining Vision-Language Models and Memory Graph for intuitive, autonomous manipulation in various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation approaches relying on precise models struggle in real-world unstructured environments and novel tasks, unlike humans who use intuitive adaptability.

Method: The method integrates Vision-Language Models for scene reasoning and a Memory Graph to record and utilize previous task interactions. An Intuitive Perceptor extracts physical relations and affordances.

Result: The framework enables robots to generalize behaviors for new tasks without repetitive instructions, leveraging memory and intuition.

Conclusion: This approach equips robots with improved adaptability and intuitive decision-making in diverse, real-world robotic manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

*Tianyuan Zheng,Jingang Yi,Kaiyan Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation (HCMR) algorithm to solve the double coverage problem for multiple robots, focusing on linear feature and area coverage with optimal path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for efficient strategies to simultaneously cover linear features and survey areas using multiple robots while minimizing path length, task time, and ensuring collision-free operations.

Method: The authors propose the HCMR algorithm, leveraging hierarchical cyclic merging search and Morse theory to identify optimal path sequences. Balanced partitioning and edge sequence back propagation are key elements in determining efficient routes.

Result: Simulation results show that the HCMR algorithm improves path lengths by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by 16.9%, and ensures conflict-free operations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The HCMR algorithm is proven to be optimal under fixed sweep directions and addresses the double coverage problem effectively, outperforming state-of-the-art planning methods.

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

*Wenjie Hu,Ye Zhou,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges in maze navigation for robotics using an efficient Hierarchical DDPG (HDDPG) algorithm, significantly improving success rates and average rewards over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maze navigation for robotics is hindered by sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and long-horizon planning issues, which degrade the performance of standard DDPG algorithms.

Method: The paper introduces HDDPG with high-level and low-level policies using an enhanced DDPG framework. It incorporates subgoals, off-policy correction, adaptive noise for exploration, and an intrinsic-extrinsic reward function, along with optimization techniques like gradient clipping and Xavier initialization.

Result: HDDPG demonstrated remarkable improvements, enhancing the success rate by at least 56.59% and boosting average rewards by a minimum of 519.03 in maze navigation tasks.

Conclusion: HDDPG significantly outperforms standard DDPG and its variants by addressing core limitations, offering a robust solution for autonomous maze navigation.

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable intelligent robots to navigate unknown environments using textual descriptions, overcoming challenges in grounding vision-language connections dynamically and without labeled data.

Method: The method enhances Visual Language Models with active grounding for perspective adjustment and memory backtracking for uncertain observation re-evaluation. The framework is zero-shot and does not use labeled data or further model fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art models in language-driven object navigation tasks on HM3D dataset and successfully demonstrated practical real-world applications on a quadruped robot.

Conclusion: The study proves the efficacy of a zero-shot VLM-based framework with human-inspired mechanisms in enhancing robotic navigation through natural language, showing its robustness in unseen and complex environments.

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

TL;DR: The paper studies shortcutting methods for improving motion quality in multi-robot arm scenarios, proposes new combination strategies, and evaluates their trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality motion planning for multi-robot arms is difficult due to high-dimensional systems and inter-arm collisions. Current planning approaches result in suboptimal smoothness and efficiency.

Method: They compare existing shortcutting methods in multi-arm systems, analyze their performance, and propose two combination strategies to optimize performance-runtime tradeoffs.

Result: The paper quantitatively assesses shortcutting techniques and demonstrates the effectiveness of their proposed strategies in simulated scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies achieve a better performance-runtime tradeoff, advancing motion quality improvements for multi-robot arms.

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping

Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the

gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the

Conclusion: Human predictions of robot intentions improve with congruent body cues, gaze, and multimodal interactions, essential for enhancing robot legibility.

tested the multimodal superiority and ocular primacy hypotheses, both of which

revealed no statistically significant differences between the local and remote

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chemist Eye, a safety monitoring system for self-driving laboratories, achieving high performance in hazard detection and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety challenges, such as fire risks and PPE compliance, in self-driving laboratories (SDLs) where mobile robots are used.

Method: The authors developed Chemist Eye, a distributed safety monitoring system utilizing RGB, depth, and infrared cameras, along with a vision-language model (VLM) for safety-related decision-making.

Result: Chemist Eye successfully achieved hazard detection and decision-making performances of 97% and 95%, respectively, when tested on real-world data with three mobile robots.

Conclusion: Chemist Eye serves as an effective tool to enhance safety in SDLs by integrating real-time monitoring, robot communication, and external notifications.

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

*Mohammed Daba,Jing Qiu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces FCBV-Net, a network using 3D point clouds and pre-trained features to improve category-level policy generalization for garment manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in robotic garment manipulation, focusing on overcoming high dimensionality, complex dynamics, and intra-category variations.

Method: FCBV-Net uses pre-trained, frozen dense geometric features to condition bimanual action value predictions and learns a task-specific policy through trainable downstream components.

Result: In simulated experiments, FCBV-Net achieved an 89% coverage and superior generalization compared to baseline methods, showing minimal performance drop on unseen garments.

Conclusion: Separating geometric understanding from bimanual action value learning improves category-level generalization for garment manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a vision-language-action model enhancing robotic manipulation by integrating task-aware view planning and task-specific representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in robotic manipulation caused by static viewpoints and task interference in shared visual encoders, which hinder 3D perception, robustness, and generalization.

Method: TAVP implements active view planning using an efficient exploration policy accelerated by a pseudo-environment and integrates a Mixture-of-Experts visual encoder for disentangled task-specific feature learning.

Result: TAVP achieves improved action prediction across diverse manipulation tasks, surpassing the performance of fixed-view approaches in RLBench experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating active view planning and task-specific representation learning enables better visual representations, improving task generalization and manipulation performance.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

TL;DR: The paper evaluates children's interactions with NED, an autonomous robot dancer, identifying challenges and emphasizing the importance of designing engaging HRI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess children's natural curiosity and responses towards a robotic art performer, and identify key areas for improving human-robot interaction within a performative arts context.

Method: The researchers conducted an observational analysis of 18 children's interactions with the robot NED in the UK installation 'Thingamabobas,' examining aspects like engagement, robot expressivity, and expectations.

Result: Three major challenges were identified: engaging children initially and consistently, improving robot expressivity and reciprocity, and aligning interactions with children's expectations.

Conclusion: Optimizing human-robot interaction systems in performance art requires focusing on the audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations for meaningful engagement, particularly for young audiences.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of 18 children's in-the-wild experiences
with the autonomous robot arm performer NED (Never-Ending Dancer) within the
Thingamabobas installation, showcased across the UK. We detail NED's design,
including costume, behaviour, and human interactions, all integral to the
installation. Our observational analysis revealed three key challenges in
child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative
arts context, to enable engaging and meaningful experiences, especially for
young audiences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore recent progress in using foundation models to enhance robotic capabilities and agentic architectures.

Method: Surveys peer-reviewed research and community-driven projects, proposes a taxonomy for model integration, and analyzes the roles of AI agents in robotic systems.

Result: Provides comparative insights on how AI agents are utilized for reasoning, planning, and interfacing in robotic solutions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential and emerging trends of integrating advanced AI models into robotics, creating more capable and interactive robotic agents.

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GhostShell is a novel approach that uses large language models (LLMs) for real-time, streaming behavioral programming in robotics, achieving high accuracy and faster response times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations of conventional methods in embodied systems, such as pre-scheduled action sequences or behavior trees, by enabling real-time decision-making through LLMs.

Method: GhostShell utilizes a streaming XML function token parser, dynamic function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler to manage robotic actions incrementally as tokens are streamed from the LLM.

Result: GhostShell achieved a Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85, outperformed LLM native function-calling APIs with up to 66X faster response times, and proved effective in long-horizon multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: GhostShell showcases the potential of LLMs to drive real-time, robust, and generalizable robotic behaviors, outperforming traditional approaches and existing APIs.

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

*Shunlei Li,Longsen Gao,Jin Wang,Chang Che,Xi Xiao,Jiuwen Cao,Yingbai Hu,Hamid Reza Karimi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GF-VLA, a framework that enables dual-arm robots to replicate human demonstrations using vision, language, and action-based reasoning for dexterous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to generalize dual-arm robot dexterous capabilities across diverse settings due to reliance on trajectory imitation.

Method: GF-VLA converts human demonstrations into information-theoretic scene graphs, processes them with language-based transformers, and generates interpretable robot commands via hierarchical behavior trees.

Result: The proposed framework achieved over 90% accuracy in graph creation, subtask segmentation, grasping, placement, and task success in dexterous dual-arm manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: GF-VLA demonstrates strong generalization, robustness, and efficiency in enabling robots to perform complex dexterous tasks directly from human demonstrations.

Abstract: Teaching robots dexterous skills from human videos remains challenging due to
the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Affecta-context, a framework allowing social robots to adapt their behaviors based on physical context and learned preferences from human interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-robot interactions by enabling robots to adapt their behaviors dynamically to different physical contexts and user requirements.

Method: The framework clusters physical contexts based on measured attributes and learns behavior prioritization through interactions, optimizing its output based on user preferences and environmental factors.

Result: A robot trained with Affecta-context was able to prioritize behaviors after 72 interactions across two physical contexts and generalize its responses to new, unvisited contexts.

Conclusion: Affecta-context enables robots to autonomously learn context-aware behavior prioritization, enhancing interaction quality and adaptability in diverse environments.

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

*Tong Hua,Jiale Han,Wei Ouyang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pose-only estimation method to enhance the efficiency and applicability of the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) in GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry (GVIO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IEKF often faces high computational demands due to joint optimization of camera poses and landmarks, limiting its efficiency for multi-sensor fusion applications.

Method: The proposed method establishes a visual measurement model linking landmark representations directly with multiple camera poses and observations. It ensures tightly-coupled integration, preserves a null space independent of poses, and includes a novel feature management strategy.

Result: Simulations and real-world tests show improved efficiency and accuracy with the proposed GVIO approach compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The multi-view pose-only estimation enhances IEKF's practicality for sensor fusion by addressing computational challenges and maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores how robots can defuse high-intensity human-robot conflicts using five affective expression modalities, showing that all modalities are effective, with movement modality slightly differing in impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how robots can mitigate hostility in human-robot confrontations, particularly when robots perform poorly.

Method: The research utilized a custom affective robot and tested 105 participants in simulated conflict scenarios, analyzing the effectiveness of five expression modalities.

Result: All modalities successfully defused the conflicts and conveyed acknowledgment, with movement modality exhibiting notable statistical differences in impact.

Conclusion: Defusing high-intensity interactions requires robots to be socially aware and respond appropriately, rather than focusing on advanced expression capabilities.

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

*Yufei Duan,Hang Yin,Danica Kragic*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an efficient inference method for Diffusion Policies in robotic tasks, reducing inference time without requiring additional training or model redesign.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of long inference times in Diffusion Policies, which hinder their application in latency-critical and simple short-cycle tasks.

Method: The authors propose an approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme from optimal control, applying this to diffusion inference, with a scaling-based method for discrete actions like grasping.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces runtime computational cost while maintaining comparable performance to full-step denoising Diffusion Policies.

Conclusion: This method allows for faster inference in robotic manipulation tasks without the need for resource-intensive retraining or redesign, enabling application to large pre-trained models.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving models overly rely on ego-vehicle status, limiting planning-oriented understanding and decision-making robustness.

Method: The model uses a teacher-student framework where a planning model provides multi-objective learning targets. Reinforcement learning and generative modeling are utilized to refine decision mappings and planning-oriented instances.

Result: Validation on nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets shows a 50% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point improvement in closed-loop performance compared to baseline.

Conclusion: DistillDrive significantly enhances planning-oriented learning for autonomous driving and provides robust decision-making capabilities. Code is open for public access.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel soft robotics framework with modular designs combining 3D-printed bones and liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles for untethered actuation and adaptive locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics has struggled to achieve adaptability and diverse functionality akin to natural organisms due to limitations in control systems and actuation.

Method: The approach utilizes 3D-printed bones and LCE muscles for distributed actuation and local infrared-driven control, supported by optimization tools for skeletal design and locomotion strategies.

Result: Developed robots demonstrated complex shape morphing, diverse control schemes, and environmental adaptability, effectively validating the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework pushes the boundaries of robotic design by enhancing modularity, control, and adaptability, drawing closer to mimicking the capabilities of natural organisms.

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

*Alexander Fabisch,Wadhah Zai El Amri,Chandandeep Singh,Nicolás Navarro-Guerrero*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper explores whether replicating the human hand in robotics is necessary for high dexterity and suggests that non-anthropomorphic or simplified hand designs could still achieve high manipulation skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if the human hand, with its intricate biomechanics and control, should be the ideal model for robotic hands or if simpler designs could achieve similar manipulative functions.

Method: A survey of human hand biomechanics, commercially available robotic and prosthetic hands, and a systematic comparison of various hand mechanisms and their associated manipulation skills.

Result: Findings show wrist flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for dexterity, while the number of fingers or degrees of freedom is less critical. Three fingers strike a balance between simplicity and capability, and non-human-like designs can further boost dexterity.

Conclusion: The human hand may not represent the optimal design for robotic manipulators. Simpler or non-anthropomorphic hand designs can perform adequately or even surpass human-like designs in terms of dexterity.

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robotic systems to adapt to diverse human collaborators and create a flexible communication framework for effective task coordination in human-robot teams.

Method: The approach operates at three layers: a meta-planner for high-level collaboration strategy, a planner for optimally allocating tasks, and an action executor to handle low-level actions or dialog, all informed by a simulation-pretrained affordance model.

Result: Evaluations involving both simulation and experiments with 18 human participants showed MICoBot's ability to collaborate more effectively, surpassing baseline models in task success and user experience.

Conclusion: MICoBot enhances human-robot collaboration by dynamically adapting to human partners through mixed-initiative dialog, demonstrating significant promise in real-world collaborative settings.

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes CleanUpBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate mobile cleaning robots with dual capabilities (sweeping and grasping) in realistic indoor cleaning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in existing Embodied AI benchmarks as they target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations but fail to address realistic and commercially viable platforms such as cleaning robots.

Method: CleanUpBench uses NVIDIA Isaac Sim to simulate a mobile cleaning robot equipped with sweeping and grasping mechanisms. The benchmark includes both manually designed and procedurally generated environments for evaluation, with metrics covering task completion, efficiency, motion quality, and control performance.

Result: CleanUpBench provides a reproducible, extensible framework for evaluating cleaning robots and offers baseline agents for comparative studies.

Conclusion: CleanUpBench serves as a scalable platform bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications for embodied AI in cleaning tasks.

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

*Jianpeng Yao,Xiaopan Zhang,Yu Xia,Zejin Wang,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance mobile robot navigation in unpredictable crowds using reinforcement learning and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile robots struggle with performance in out-of-distribution crowd scenarios, posing safety and robustness challenges during navigation.

Method: The proposed approach integrates uncertainty estimates from adaptive conformal inference into agent observations, guiding their behavior via constrained reinforcement learning.

Result: The method achieves a 96.93% success rate in in-distribution scenarios, outperforming current baselines, and demonstrates strong robustness in out-of-distribution cases, including velocity variations, policy changes, and group dynamics.

Conclusion: By incorporating prediction uncertainty, the method enables robots to navigate more safely and robustly in diverse crowds, validated further through real-world experiments.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are
available on https://gen-safe-nav.github.io/.

### [319] [Automated File-Level Logging Generation for Machine Learning Applications using LLMs: A Case Study using GPT-4o Mini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04820)
*Mayra Sofia Ruiz Rodriguez,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study evaluates GPT-4o mini's ability to generate file-level log statements for ML projects, finding a high alignment in log placement but challenges with overlogging and adherence to human-like practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating comprehensive file-level log statements, especially in ML applications, where reliable logging is critical but underexplored.

Method: The study involved analyzing 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files. Original logs were removed, and the LLM was prompted to generate new logs. The generated logs were compared to human-written logs in placement, log level, variables, and quality. Manual analysis was also performed to identify patterns and challenges.

Result: The LLM placed logs in the same location as humans at a rate of 63.91%, but exhibited a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Issues such as overlogging at function boundaries, difficulties within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific conventions were observed.

Conclusion: While GPT-4o mini shows promise for file-level log generation, significant challenges remain, including overlogging and inconsistency with human conventions, which need to be addressed for practical use.

Abstract: Logging is essential in software development, helping developers monitor
system behavior and aiding in debugging applications. Given the ability of
large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers
are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work
focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log
generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications,
where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate
the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML
projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing
4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed
the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,
and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text
quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we
manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common
patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place
as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of
82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level
logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,
difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with
project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for
generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed
for practical implementation.

### [320] [Automated Bug Frame Retrieval from Gameplay Videos Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04895)
*Wentao Lu,Alexander Senchenko,Abram Hindle,Cor-Paul Bezemer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated pipeline that reduces bug-report gameplay videos to a single keyframe that best matches the described issue, minimizing manual review effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers waste significant time manually reviewing gameplay videos in bug reports, a process that is slow, labour-intensive, and unscalable given the high volume of submissions.

Method: The pipeline uses FFmpeg for keyframe extraction to filter down video frames and a vision-language model (GPT-4o) to select the frame that aligns best with the textual bug description.

Result: The system reduced videos to 1.90% of their frames, maintained a bug capture rate of 98.79%, and achieved an F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the most relevant frame, with varied performance across bug categories.

Conclusion: The proposed approach replaces tedious video viewing with automated keyframe extraction, significantly reducing manual effort while improving quality assurance and bug triage workflows in game development.

Abstract: Modern game studios deliver new builds and patches at a rapid pace,
generating thousands of bug reports, many of which embed gameplay videos. To
verify and triage these bug reports, developers must watch the submitted
videos. This manual review is labour-intensive, slow, and hard to scale. In
this paper, we introduce an automated pipeline that reduces each video to a
single frame that best matches the reported bug description, giving developers
instant visual evidence that pinpoints the bug.
  Our pipeline begins with FFmpeg for keyframe extraction, reducing each video
to a median of just 1.90% of its original frames while still capturing bug
moments in 98.79 of cases. These keyframes are then evaluated by a
vision--language model (GPT-4o), which ranks them based on how well they match
the textual bug description and selects the most representative frame. We
evaluated this approach using real-world developer-submitted gameplay videos
and JIRA bug reports from a popular First-Person Shooter (FPS) game. The
pipeline achieves an overall F1 score of 0.79 and Accuracy of 0.89 for the
top-1 retrieved frame. Performance is highest for the Lighting & Shadow (F1 =
0.94), Physics & Collision (0.86), and UI & HUD (0.83) bug categories, and
lowest for Animation & VFX (0.51).
  By replacing video viewing with an immediately informative image, our
approach dramatically reduces manual effort and speeds up triage and regression
checks, offering practical benefits to quality assurance (QA) teams and
developers across the game industry.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on Open Source Software (OSS) through a socio-technical framework, offering proactive strategies for community resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of Generative AI poses challenges and uncertainties for Open Source Software communities, necessitating frameworks to handle the complexity and maintain OSS's collaborative foundation.

Method: A conceptual, scenario-driven exploration is conducted using McLuhan's Tetrad-based socio-technical framework, focusing on GenAI disruptions in software practices, documentation, community engagement, and governance.

Result: The framework identifies risks and opportunities in each domain, enabling OSS communities to understand GenAI’s impacts comprehensively.

Conclusion: OSS leaders and researchers can use the findings to take proactive measures to guide their ecosystems amid GenAI-driven changes, rather than being reactive.

Abstract: Open Source Software communities face a wave of uncertainty as Generative AI
rapidly transforms how software is created, maintained, and governed. Without
clear frameworks, communities risk being overwhelmed by the complexity and
ambiguity introduced by GenAI, threatening the collaborative ethos that
underpins OSS. We conduct a scenario-driven, conceptual exploration using a
socio-technical framework inspired by McLuhan's Tetrad to surface both risks
and opportunities for community resilience amid GenAI-driven disruption of OSS
development across four domains: software practices, documentation, community
engagement, and governance. By adopting this lens, OSS leaders and researchers
can proactively shape the future of their ecosystems, rather than simply
reacting to technological upheaval.

### [322] [Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925)
*Sigma Jahan,Saurabh Singh Rajput,Tushar Sharma,Mohammad Masudur Rahman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores failures specific to attention mechanisms in neural networks and introduces a new fault taxonomy, providing diagnostic heuristics to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to fill a critical gap in understanding attention mechanism-specific failures in neural networks, as existing fault taxonomies fail to adequately address these issues.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic study of 555 real-world faults from 96 projects across ten frameworks, developing a novel taxonomy of seven attention-specific fault categories.

Result: The study found that more than half of the analyzed faults arose from attention-specific mechanisms and identified four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics explaining 33% of these faults.

Conclusion: This research offers the first comprehensive taxonomy and diagnostic guidance for addressing attention-specific issues in neural networks, aiding practitioners in improving system reliability.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering
systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major
economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical
outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention
weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault
taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by
attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable
diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work
is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96
projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack
Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven
attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results
show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to
attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations
of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root
cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that
explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic
diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.

TL;DR: This study explores the underexamined relationship between large language models (LLMs) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to enhance programming learning and workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the rapid advances in AI, particularly LLMs, and the lack of understanding about their potential to enhance OOP learning, coding efficacy, and evaluation processes.

Method: The authors present a vision by analyzing perspectives from key stakeholders involved in OOP tasks and identifying points in coding workflows where LLMs could provide improvements.

Result: They identify important stages in coding workflows where integrating LLMs can significantly benefit learning and code development.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with OOP practices shows potential for enhancing logical reasoning, code writing, and overall programming experience.

Abstract: We find ourselves in the midst of an explosion in artificial intelligence
research, particularly with large language models (LLMs). These models have
diverse applications spanning finance, commonsense knowledge graphs, medicine,
and visual analysis. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), a robust
body of knowledge and methods has been developed for managing complex tasks
through object-oriented thinking. However, the intersection of LLMs with OOP
remains an underexplored territory. Empirically, we currently possess limited
understanding of how LLMs can enhance the effectiveness of OOP learning and
code writing, as well as how we can evaluate such AI-powered tools. Our work
aims to address this gap by presenting a vision from the perspectives of key
stakeholders involved in an OOP task: programmers, mariners, and experienced
programmers. We identify critical junctures within typical coding workflows
where the integration of LLMs can offer significant benefits. Furthermore, we
propose ways to augment existing logical reasoning and code writing, ultimately
enhancing the programming experience.

### [324] [An ML-based Approach to Predicting Software Change Dependencies: Insights from an Empirical Study on OpenStack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05034)
*Arabat,Ali,Sayagh,Mohammed,Hassine,Jameleddine*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: As software systems grow complex, identifying dependencies among changes is critical for CI/CD efficiency. A study on OpenStack finds frequent interdependencies, often identified late in the process. Authors propose ML models to address this with significant predictive success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenge of identifying change dependencies in complex software systems, which is crucial for preventing build failures and ensuring efficient feature deployments.

Method: The authors conducted a study on OpenStack to understand the prevalence and impact of interdependent changes. They then proposed a semi-automated approach using two machine learning models to predict dependencies and identify dependent change pairs.

Result: The study revealed that over 51% of dependencies in OpenStack were identified late (median delay of 5.06 hours) after creation. The proposed ML models showed high performance with AUC scores of 79.33% and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014.

Conclusion: The research underscores the need for proactive dependency management in software development. Their ML-based approach demonstrates strong potential to improve the dependency identification process, though precision could benefit from further refinement.

Abstract: As software systems grow in complexity, accurately identifying and managing
dependencies among changes becomes increasingly critical. For instance, a
change that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.
Establishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate
changes effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature
deployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple
components across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.
They serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing
configurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like
documentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary
study on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our
study revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over
the past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these
dependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay
of 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often
spend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a
median of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify
dependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML
models. The first model predicts the likelihood of dependencies among changes,
while the second identifies the exact pairs of dependent changes. Our proposed
models demonstrate strong performance, achieving average AUC scores of 79.33%
and 91.89%, and Brier scores of 0.11 and 0.014, respectively. Indeed, the
second model has a good top-k recall across all types of pairs, while the top-k
precision has room for improvement.

*Junayed Mahmud,James Chen,Terry Achille,Camilo Alvarez-Velez,Darren Dean Bansil,Patrick Ijieh,Samar Karanch,Nadeeshan De Silva,Oscar Chaparro,Andrian Marcus,Kevin Moran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents LadyBug, a GitHub bot designed for automatic localization of bugs in Android apps through text retrieval combined with UI interaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to streamline the bug localization process for Android apps by leveraging a combination of textual bug descriptions and UI-based reproduction traces.

Method: LadyBug works by connecting to a GitHub repository, accepting bug reproduction traces uploaded by developers, and employing text retrieval and UI data to generate ranked bug localization.

Result: Empirical evaluation using the RedWing benchmark showed LadyBug's higher accuracy and better performance than traditional text-retrieval methods, especially when incorporating UI information.

Conclusion: LadyBug significantly improves bug localization in Android apps, demonstrating potential for enhanced accuracy and utility in real-world development environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces LadyBug, a GitHub bot that automatically localizes bugs
for Android apps by combining UI interaction information with text retrieval.
LadyBug connects to an Android app's GitHub repository, and is triggered when a
bug is reported in the corresponding issue tracker. Developers can then record
a reproduction trace for the bug on a device or emulator and upload the trace
to LadyBug via the GitHub issue tracker. This enables LadyBug to utilize both
the text from the original bug description, and UI information from the
reproduction trace to accurately retrieve a ranked list of files from the
project that most likely contain the reported bug.
  We empirically evaluated LadyBug using an automated testing pipeline and
benchmark called RedWing that contains 80 fully-localized and reproducible bug
reports from 39 Android apps. Our results illustrate that LadyBug outperforms
text-retrieval-based baselines and that the utilization of UI information leads
to a substantial increase in localization accuracy. LadyBug is an open-source
tool, available at https://github.com/LadyBugML/ladybug.

### [326] [Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170)
*Lishui Fan,Yu Zhang,Mouxiang Chen,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework for code generation, focusing on assessing and integrating reasoning quality during the process. It includes a benchmark, a reward training method, and an RL method to combat reward hacking, achieving notable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for code generation prioritize outcome-based rewards but fail to consider the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight leads to inefficiencies and hinders model effectiveness.

Method: The authors propose a framework with three components: LCB-RB, a new benchmark for evaluating reasoning; an Optimized-Degraded-based reward model training method for scoring reasoning quality; and Posterior-GRPO, an RL method that conditions reasoning rewards on successful task outcomes.

Result: The framework demonstrated robust performance, with a 7B reward model achieving state-of-the-art results on reasoning benchmarks and a 7B code generation model outperforming baseline outcomes by 4.5%, matching GPT-4-Turbo performance on code tasks.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of reasoning quality in RL-based code generation and provides a comprehensive approach for integrating it into the training process, showcasing improvements beyond outcome-only approaches and generalizing across domains like mathematical tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for
large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based
rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning
process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising
direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model
learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.
To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively
incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable
reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference
pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score
reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method
for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs
by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along
curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical
rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other
benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method
that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying
rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO
effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning
with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior
performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only
baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further
demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to
mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.

*Felix Neubauer,Jürgen Pleiss,Benjamin Uekermann*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) and deterministic techniques into MetaConfigurator to enable easier creation, modification, and mapping of JSON schemas using natural language, primarily aimed at simplifying structured data modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many domains lack standardized models for research data, causing difficulties especially for non-experts in creating structured data schemas, which hampers data integration and usability.

Method: The proposed approach combines LLMs with deterministic techniques to create and modify JSON Schema and automate schema mapping from various data formats (JSON, CSV, XML, YAML). It is implemented in an open-source tool, MetaConfigurator, which includes features like visual model editing and code generation.

Result: The hybrid technique successfully generates effective schema mappings using LLMs and ensures scalability and reliability via deterministic rules. Its usability is demonstrated through a chemistry application example.

Conclusion: The approach lowers barriers to structured data modeling and integration for non-experts, leveraging natural language input alongside deterministic safeguards for reliability and scalability.

Abstract: Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models at the core of system and data
engineering processes. In the context of research data, these models are
typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of
datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating
them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a
hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic
techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping
based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated
into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model
editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data
integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and
YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through
deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our
work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By
combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work
significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data
integration for non-experts.

TL;DR: SX-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating large language models on complex, multi-function reasoning tasks, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for large language models in code intelligence lack the ability to thoroughly assess complex reasoning and dynamic execution modeling.

Method: The authors introduced SX-Bench, which evaluates models on collaborative multi-function tasks, emphasizing overall control flow, data flow, and step-wise computational reasoning.

Result: Evaluation on 20+ models, including advanced ones like OpenAI-O3, showed SX-Bench identifies reasoning bottlenecks, with even the best model achieving only 78.37% accuracy.

Conclusion: SX-Bench pushes code intelligence evaluation from simple function verification to multi-function dynamic reasoning, offering a discriminative tool for advanced model assessment.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in code intelligence, yet systematically evaluating their code understanding
and reasoning abilities remains challenging. Mainstream benchmarks such as
HumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning
benchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity
scenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores,
limiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present
STEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex
multi-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench
features tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g.,
chained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and
data flow modeling. It defines "computation steps" as the minimal execution
unit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning
tasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution
beyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including
14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly
discriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent
accuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on
previous benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained
reasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis,
symbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation
and quality assurance. SX-Bench advances code evaluation from "single-function
verification" to "multi-function dynamic reasoning," providing a key tool for
the in-depth assessment of advanced code intelligence models.

*Igor Costa,Christopher Baran*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EvoGraph is a framework enabling automated software evolution across multiple artifacts using specialized language models for mutation and multi-objective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in modernizing software systems and maintaining their operational metrics under measurable control in dynamic environments.

Method: EvoGraph represents artifacts in typed directed graphs, uses small language models (SLMs) for targeted mutations, and applies multi-objective fitness for survivor selection.

Result: Achieved 82–96% semantic equivalence for legacy modernization, fixed 83% of security vulnerabilities, enabled rapid COBOL-to-Java translation, and drastically reduced computational costs and latency.

Conclusion: EvoGraph presents viable mechanisms for Software 3.0 systems, enabling adaptive, efficient, and systematically controlled software evolution.

Abstract: We introduce **EvoGraph**, a framework that enables software systems to
evolve their own source code, build pipelines, documentation, and tickets.
EvoGraph represents every artefact in a typed directed graph, applies learned
mutation operators driven by specialized small language models (SLMs), and
selects survivors with a multi-objective fitness. On three benchmarks, EvoGraph
fixes 83% of known security vulnerabilities, translates COBOL to Java with 93%
functional equivalence (test verified), and maintains documentation freshness
within two minutes. Experiments show a 40% latency reduction and a sevenfold
drop in feature lead time compared with strong baselines. We extend our
approach to **evoGraph**, leveraging language-specific SLMs for modernizing
.NET, Lisp, CGI, ColdFusion, legacy Python, and C codebases, achieving 82-96%
semantic equivalence across languages while reducing computational costs by 90%
compared to large language models. EvoGraph's design responds to empirical
failure modes in legacy modernization, such as implicit contracts, performance
preservation, and integration evolution. Our results suggest a practical path
toward Software 3.0, where systems adapt continuously yet remain under
measurable control.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model and methodology to leverage IoT in enhancing business process sustainability not solely focused on environmental concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in sustainability research in BPM that often neglects a holistic approach beyond environmental concerns.

Method: It presents a conceptual model linking IoT with BPM and a methodology to analyze, identify opportunities, and create sustainability-aware IoT-enhanced BPs.

Result: Demonstrated through examples in tourism and healthcare domains, showcasing the practical application of the methodology.

Conclusion: The proposed approach highlights IoT's role in fostering holistic sustainability across various dimensions of business processes.

Abstract: The real-time data collection and automation capabilities offered by the
Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing and transforming Business
Processes (BPs) into IoT-enhanced BPs, showing high potential for improving
sustainability. Although already studied in Business Process Management (BPM),
sustainability research has primarily focused on environmental concerns.
However, achieving a holistic and lasting impact requires a systematic approach

proposes a conceptual model and a structured methodology with the goal of
analyzing the potential of IoT to measure and improve the sustainability of
BPs. The conceptual model formally represents key sustainability concepts,
linking BPM and IoT by highlighting how IoT devices support and contribute to
sustainability. The methodology guides the systematic analysis of existing BPs,
identifies opportunities, and implements sustainability-aware, IoT-enhanced
BPs. The approach is illustrated through a running example from the tourism
domain and a case study in healthcare.

### [331] [Evaluating the Use of LLMs for Documentation to Code Traceability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16440)
*Ebube Alor,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in automating documentation-to-code traceability using new datasets and systematic experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how well LLMs can establish trace links between software documentation and code, a valuable task in software engineering that remains underexplored.

Method: Evaluation involves creating two datasets from open-source projects, testing LLMs’ performance in trace link accuracy, explanation quality, and chain reconstruction, and comparing results with baseline methods.

Result: Best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4%, surpasses traditional models, and demonstrates high explanation accuracy with certain limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as assistants in trace discovery tasks but still require human-in-the-loop systems to address specific error patterns and improve performance further.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new potential for automating
documentation-to-code traceability, yet their capabilities remain
underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various
software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source
code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog
and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key
capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship
explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that
the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two
datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and
CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to
71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections
are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy
but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that
many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or
overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing,
such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These
findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their
limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight
specific error patterns for future research.

### [332] [How Robust are LLM-Generated Library Imports? An Empirical Study using Stack Overflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10818)
*Jasmine Latendresse,SayedHassan Khatoonabadi,Emad Shihab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates how state-of-the-art LLMs recommend Python libraries for real-world problems and finds they favor third-party libraries but have usability gaps related to dependency resolution and installation guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing reliance on LLMs for coding, understanding how these models recommend and influence dependence on software libraries is critical for improving functionality and workflow.

Method: The authors conducted an empirical analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs by evaluating their recommendations for Python libraries to address real-world Stack Overflow problems, focusing on factors like library usability and dependency resolution.

Result: LLMs tend to favor mature, popular, and permissively licensed third-party libraries over standard ones. However, 4.6% of suggested libraries had unresolved dependency issues, and only two models provided installation instructions.

Conclusion: Although LLMs generate technically valid code, they lack sufficient contextual support for resolving and installing dependencies, placing extra effort on developers. There is a clear opportunity for improving the usability of LLM-generated software solutions in dependency management areas.

Abstract: Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and
maintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how
these models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an
empirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source,
by prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack
Overflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of
those libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of
the box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries
over standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively
licensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the
libraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches
between import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)
provided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,
the lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving
dependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both
developers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the
reliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software
dependencies.

*Yifan Wang,Jingyuan Sun,Jichen Zheng,Yunhao Zhang,Chunyu Ye,Jixing Li,Chengqing Zong,Shaonan Wang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper models aphasia by simulating linguistic deficits in modular large language models and validates the approach with patient-like outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if large language models can simulate language deficits caused by brain injuries and contribute to understanding and treating language disorders.

Method: The authors lesioned specific components of a modular Mixture-of-Experts language model to mimic aphasia subtypes, validated the outcomes against patient data, and explored functional recovery through retraining.

Result: Lesioning syntax or semantics experts replicated Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, and retraining intact modules showed significant linguistic recovery.

Conclusion: Modular LLMs are valuable frameworks for studying language disorders and exploring therapies through computational modeling.

Abstract: The striking alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human brain
activity positions them as powerful models of healthy cognition. This parallel
raises a fundamental question: if LLMs can model the intact brain, can we
lesion them to simulate the linguistic deficits of the injured brain? In this
work, we introduce a methodology to model aphasia - a complex language disorder
caused by neural injury - by selectively disabling components in a modular
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model. We simulate distinct aphasia subtypes,
validate their linguistic outputs against real patient speech, and then
investigate functional recovery by retraining the model's remaining healthy
experts. Our results demonstrate that lesioning functionally-specialized
experts for syntax or semantics induces distinct impairments that closely
resemble Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, respectively. Crucially, we show that
freezing the damaged experts and retraining the intact ones on conversational
data restores significant linguistic function, demonstrating a computational
analogue for rehabilitation. These findings establish modular LLMs as a
powerful and clinically-relevant potential framework for modeling the
mechanisms of language disorders and for computationally exploring novel
pathways for therapy.

*Paul Triebkorn,Huifang E. Wang,Marmaduke Woodman,Maxime Guye,Fabrice Bartolomei,Viktor Jirsa*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper identifies delay-constrained re-entry of excitation loops as a mechanism driving seizures, using virtual brain modeling from patient data and suggesting methods for targeted disruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how travelling excitation loops that are suspected to drive seizures arise in patient brain networks and how vulnerable they are to targeted disruption.

Method: Millimetre-scale virtual brain reconstruction from diffusion MRI of a drug-resistant epilepsy patient, embedding excitable neural fields and analyzing delay-coupling effects.

Result: The study demonstrates that realistic cortico-cortical delays generate self-sustaining re-entry of excitation loops. Narrow delay-coupling windows predict seizure features, and phase-dependent interventions can terminate re-entry.

Conclusion: Delay-constrained re-entry serves as a fundamental mechanism for brain synchronization in epilepsy, providing a pathway for precision neuromodulation and minimally invasive interventions.

Abstract: Re-entry of travelling excitation loops is a long-suspected driver of human
seizures, yet how such loops arise in patient brain networks -- and how
susceptible they are to targeted disruption -- remains unclear. We reconstruct
a millimetre-scale virtual brain from diffusion MRI of a drug-resistant
epilepsy patient, embed excitable Epileptor neural fields, and show that
realistic cortico-cortical delays are sufficient to generate self-sustaining
re-entry. Systematic parameter sweeps reveal a narrow delay-coupling window
that predicts oscillation frequency and seizure duration across 184 recorded
seizures. Precisely timed biphasic stimuli or sub-millimetre virtual lesions
abort re-entry in silico, yielding phase-dependent termination rules validated
in intracranial recordings. Our framework exposes delay-constrained re-entry as
a generic dynamical mechanism for large-scale brain synchrony and provides a
patient-specific testbed for precision neuromodulation and minimally invasive
disconnection.

*Mariia Sorokina*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fractal frequency mapping method replicating complex neuronal effects by transforming input spectra to excite novel components, forming spikes at resonant frequencies for enhanced detection and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable a novel approach for modeling neuronal activity and addressing limitations in conventional filters by replicating and enhancing signal sensitivity and robustness.

Method: The method employs fractal recomposition of input spectra, transforming frequencies to excite components that optimize detection at resonant frequencies.

Result: The model demonstrates improved signal detection sensitivity and noise robustness alongside amplification of noise-induced signals.

Conclusion: Neuronal functionality can be understood as linear spectral summation after nonlinear frequency domain transformation, as validated with the proposed fractal mapping technique.

Abstract: We propose the first fractal frequency mapping, which in a simple form
enables to replicate complex neuronal effects. Unlike the conventional filters,
which suppress or amplify the input spectral components according to the filter
weights, the transformation excites novel components by a fractal recomposition
of the input spectra resulting in a formation of spikes at resonant frequencies
that are optimal for sampling. This enables high sensitivity detection,
robustness to noise and noise-induced signal amplification. The proposed model
illustrates that a neuronal functionality can be viewed as a linear summation
of spectrum over nonlinearly transformed frequency domain.

### [336] [Covariance spectrum in nonlinear recurrent neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05288)
*Xuanyu Shen,Yu Hu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study extends prior work on covariance eigenvalue spectrum by analyzing its behavior in neural networks with nonlinear neurons and in chaotic dynamics, providing a unified interpretation of population activity dynamics using effective recurrent connection strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in theory between prior studies of covariance eigenvalue distributions in linear neural dynamics and their empirical applications to experimental data from biological circuits.

Method: The research investigates covariance spectrum properties in neural networks with nonlinear neurons and explores these properties under broader dynamical regimes, including chaos, using equations derived by substituting linear theories with effective recurrent connection strength parameters.

Result: The spectrum in nonlinear networks can be understood using equations analogous to the linear theory, adjusted with effective connection strength parameters. It unifies interpretation across dynamic regimes and maintains critical properties near chaotic ranges without needing fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This work enhances the theoretical understanding of nonlinear neural population dynamics and validates the application of covariance spectrum analysis to biological neural circuits across different regimes.

Abstract: Advances in simultaneous recordings of large numbers of neurons have driven
significant interest in the structure of neural population activity such as
dimension. A key question is how these dynamic features arise mechanistically
and their relationship to circuit connectivity. It was previously proposed to
use the covariance eigenvalue distribution, or spectrum, which can be
analytically derived in random recurrent networks, as a robust measure to
describe the shape of neural population activity beyond the dimension (Hu and
Sompolinsky 2022). Applications of the theoretical spectrum have broadly found
accurate matches to experimental data across brain areas providing mechanistic
insights into the observed low dimensional population dynamics (Morales et al.
2023). However, the empirical success highlights a gap in theory, as the neural
network model used to derive the spectrum was minimal with linear neurons. In
this work, we aim to close this gap by studying the covariance spectrum in
networks with nonlinear neurons and under broader dynamical regimes including
chaos. Surprisingly, we found that the spectrum can be precisely understood by
equations analogous to the linear theory substituted with an effective
recurrent connection strength parameter, that reflects both the connection
weights and the nonlinearity of neurons. Across dynamical regimes, this
effective connection strength provides a unified interpretation for the
spectrum and dimension changes, and stays near the critical value in the
chaotic regime without fine-tuning. These results further our understanding of
nonlinear neural population dynamics and provide additional theoretical support
for applying the covariance spectrum analysis in biological circuits.

*Yuxuan Tao,Adel Javanmard*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for variable selection with False Discovery Rate control under differential privacy constraints, using Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation to address privacy issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between knockoff-based False Discovery Rate (FDR) control and private data release, enabling robust variable selection in sensitive, high-dimensional domains.

Method: The authors utilize Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation for privatizing data, ensuring approximate isometry and differential privacy. They complement this with a theoretical analysis of a novel debiasing technique.

Result: Theoretical analysis suggests sufficient conditions under which the method achieves high power while preserving privacy. Structural privacy via random projections outperforms traditional noise addition mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers reliable variable selection, balancing privacy and statistical rigor, thus advancing methodologies in sensitive data contexts.

Abstract: We introduce a novel privatization framework for high-dimensional controlled
variable selection. Our framework enables rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control under differential privacy constraints. While the Model-X knockoff
procedure provides FDR guarantees by constructing provably exchangeable
``negative control" features, existing privacy mechanisms like Laplace or
Gaussian noise injection disrupt its core exchangeability conditions. Our key
innovation lies in privatizing the data knockoff matrix through the Gaussian
Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transformation (JLT), a dimension reduction technique
that simultaneously preserves covariate relationships through approximate
isometry for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy.
  We theoretically characterize both FDR and the power of the proposed private
variable selection procedure, in an asymptotic regime. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the role of different factors, such as the JLT's dimension
reduction ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, differential privacy parameters, sample
size and feature dimension, in shaping the privacy-power trade-off. Our
analysis is based on a novel `debiasing technique' for high-dimensional private
knockoff procedure. We further establish sufficient conditions under which the
power of the proposed procedure converges to one. This work bridges two
critical paradigms -- knockoff-based FDR control and private data release --
enabling reliable variable selection in sensitive domains. Our analysis
demonstrates that structural privacy preservation through random projections
outperforms the classical noise addition mechanism, maintaining statistical
power even under strict privacy budgets.

Motivation: The study aims to investigate how discretization schedules impact the sampling efficiency of masked discrete diffusion models and leverage information geometry for optimization.

Method: Analyzing the Fisher-Rao geometry of the underlying probability path to determine an optimal discretization schedule.

Conclusion: The cosine schedule is validated as optimal under Fisher-Rao geometry, establishing its theoretical basis in masked discrete diffusion models.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of choosing the discretisation schedule

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differential privacy method for quantile regression in high-dimensional, distributed data settings, addressing challenges in privacy, computational efficiency, and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and computational challenges when analyzing high-dimensional and distributed data with sensitive information using quantile regression.

Method: A Newton-type transformation reformulates quantile regression into ordinary least squares, facilitating the development of a differentially private iterative estimation algorithm and debiased estimator for inference.

Result: Extensive simulations show the proposed methods are robust and effective for high-dimensional quantile regression in both small and large local data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches successfully ensure privacy while achieving high statistical accuracy and valid inference capabilities in distributed high-dimensional data analysis.

Abstract: With the development of big data and machine learning, privacy concerns have
become increasingly critical, especially when handling heterogeneous datasets
containing sensitive personal information. Differential privacy provides a
rigorous framework for safeguarding individual privacy while enabling
meaningful statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a differentially
private quantile regression method for high-dimensional data in a distributed
setting. Quantile regression is a powerful and robust tool for modeling the
relationships between the covariates and responses in the presence of outliers
or heavy-tailed distributions. To address the computational challenges due to
the non-smoothness of the quantile loss function, we introduce a Newton-type
transformation that reformulates the quantile regression task into an ordinary
least squares problem. Building on this, we develop a differentially private
estimation algorithm with iterative updates, ensuring both near-optimal
statistical accuracy and formal privacy guarantees. For inference, we further
propose a differentially private debiased estimator, which enables valid
confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. Additionally, we
propose a communication-efficient and differentially private bootstrap for
simultaneous hypothesis testing in high-dimensional quantile regression,
suitable for distributed settings with both small and abundant local data.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
methods in practical scenarios.

Motivation: Address the gap in binary classification problems involving multivariate functional covariates.

Method: Develop an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine with a corresponding algorithm for feature selection and prediction.

Result: Numerical experiments and real-world application show strong predictive performance and effective feature selection.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for both prediction and identifying relevant functional covariates in binary classification tasks.

Abstract: In functional data analysis, binary classification with one functional

considering multivariate functional covariates in classification. In
particular, we propose an $L_1$-regularized functional support vector machine
for binary classification. An accompanying algorithm is developed to fit the
classifier. By imposing an $L_1$ penalty, the algorithm enables us to identify
relevant functional covariates of the binary response. Numerical results from
simulations and one real-world application demonstrate that the proposed
classifier enjoys good performance in both prediction and feature selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the bias structure in the LSA algorithm with PR averaging in the presence of Markovian noise.

Method: Introduced a new decomposition technique using a linearization approach, and applied the Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation to reduce the leading bias term.

Result: Derived high-order moment bounds for the RR iterates and demonstrated the alignment of leading error terms with the optimal covariance matrix of vanilla PR-averaged LSA iterates.

Conclusion: The proposed RR extrapolation successfully cancels the leading bias term, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the LSA algorithm under the studied conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the bias and high-order error bounds of the Linear
Stochastic Approximation (LSA) algorithm with Polyak-Ruppert (PR) averaging
under Markovian noise. We focus on the version of the algorithm with constant
step size $\alpha$ and propose a novel decomposition of the bias via a
linearization technique. We analyze the structure of the bias and show that the
leading-order term is linear in $\alpha$ and cannot be eliminated by PR
averaging. To address this, we apply the Richardson-Romberg (RR) extrapolation
procedure, which effectively cancels the leading bias term. We derive
high-order moment bounds for the RR iterates and show that the leading error
term aligns with the asymptotically optimal covariance matrix of the vanilla
averaged LSA iterates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of Alzheimer's disease by understanding molecular-level gene interactions essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Method: A Quantum Regression Network (Alz-QNet) was developed leveraging Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to study gene interactions in Alzheimer's, utilizing genetic data from the GSE138852 database.

Result: The study identified intricate gene interactions in Alzheimer's, highlighting key genes (APP, FGF14, YY1, and others) and potential regulatory mechanisms within the Entorhinal Cortex.

Conclusion: Alz-QNet advances our understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathology and offers insights into potential gene inhibitors or regulators for therapy.

Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's disease
(AD) by studying crucial genes associated with the disease remains a challenge.
Alzheimer's, being a multifactorial disease, requires understanding the
gene-gene interactions underlying it for theranostics and progress. In this
article, a novel attempt has been made using a quantum regression to decode how
some crucial genes in the AD Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein ($APP$), Sterol
regulatory element binding transcription factor 14 ($FGF14$), Yin Yang 1
($YY1$), and Phospholipase D Family Member 3 ($PLD3$) etc. become influenced by
other prominent switching genes during disease progression, which may help in
gene expression-based therapy for AD. Our proposed Quantum Regression Network
(Alz-QNet) introduces a pioneering approach with insights from the
state-of-the-art Quantum Gene Regulatory Networks (QGRN) to unravel the gene
interactions involved in AD pathology, particularly within the Entorhinal
Cortex (EC), where early pathological changes occur. Using the proposed
Alz-QNet framework, we explore the interactions between key genes ($APP$,
$FGF14$, $YY1$, $EGR1$, $GAS7$, $AKT3$, $SREBF2$, and $PLD3$) within the CE
microenvironment of AD patients, studying genetic samples from the database
$GSE138852$, all of which are believed to play a crucial role in the
progression of AD. Our investigation uncovers intricate gene-gene interactions,
shedding light on the potential regulatory mechanisms that underlie the
pathogenesis of AD, which help us to find potential gene inhibitors or
regulators for theranostics.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces JPS, a method to jailbreak multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by combining adversarial visual and textual strategies for maximized attack success and malicious intent fulfillment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak research mainly focuses on increasing attack success rate (ASR) without ensuring that the generated outputs fulfill the malicious intent of the attackers, leading to low-quality harmful content.

Method: JPS combines adversarial image perturbations and a steering prompt optimized through a multi-agent system. These components are iteratively co-optimized to bypass safety filters and guide responses that align with malicious intent.

Result: JPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both attack success rate (ASR) and Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) across multiple models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach improves the quality and precision of jailbreak attacks against MLLMs, presenting a more effective threat mechanism through collaborative visual and textual strategies.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a
significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on
maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated
responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight
frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack
substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,
\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation
and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of
visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes
target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,
complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to
specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual
and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced
performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the
Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a
Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new
state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with
analyses confirming its efficacy. Codes are available at

### [344] [Embedding Alignment in Code Generation for Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05473)
*Sam Kouteili,Hiren Madhu,George Typaldos,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper explores LLM-based live-coding for creative domains by investigating and aligning code and audio embedding spaces, aiming for musically diverse outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of limited diversity and lack of insight into audio outputs in LLM-generated code, particularly in creative coding and live-coding contexts.

Method: The authors analyze the relationship between code and audio embedding spaces and introduce a predictive model to create a code-audio embedding alignment map.

Result: The relationship between code and audio embedding spaces is not linear, but the predictive model demonstrates that alignment between these embeddings can be learned.

Conclusion: Embedding alignment between code and audio can assist in generating diverse and intentional audio outputs in creative coding contexts.

Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative
coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural
motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users
may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize
their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present
unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's
audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and
produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and
audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a
simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive
model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the
aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts
output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.

### [345] [Federal Reserve Communication and the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04830)
*Jonathan Benchimol,Sophia Kazinnik,Yossi Saadon*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper examines the Federal Reserve's communication strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them to previous crises, using sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how central bank communication, specifically the Federal Reserve's strategies, evolves during periods of economic distress, especially the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous crises.

Method: The study employs specialized dictionaries on COVID-19 and policy topics, alongside sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques to analyze communication, and conducts a comparative analysis with prior crises like the dot-com and global financial crises.

Result: It identifies a distinct focus on financial stability, market volatility, social welfare, and unconventional monetary policy during COVID-19, with increased contextual uncertainty. Fed's communication was more reactive during the COVID-19 crisis, and sentiment decline in financial stability indicated forthcoming accommodative monetary policies.

Conclusion: Post-crisis, communicating about unconventional monetary policy has become a new norm for the Fed, showing an institutional adaptation in its communication strategy. This offers insights into central bank communication shifts during exceptional economic scenarios.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the Federal Reserve's communication strategies
during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with communication during previous
periods of economic stress. Using specialized dictionaries tailored to
COVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,
combined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a
distinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,
market volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual
uncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication
during the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global
financial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our
findings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to
the COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment
related to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes
anticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further
document that communicating about UMP has become the "new normal" for the Fed's
Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the
Global Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in
communication strategy following periods of economic distress. These findings
contribute to our understanding of how central bank communication evolves
during crises and how communication strategies adapt to exceptional economic
circumstances.

*Li-Ru Zhang,Haiping Huang*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This study explores chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks by examining kinetic energy distributions, revealing critical transitions and steady-state activity behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the connection between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in random recurrent neural networks.

Method: Used dynamical mean-field theory and numerical simulations to analyze kinetic energy distribution and phase transitions in neural dynamics.

Result: Found that coupling variance drives a continuous shift in kinetic energy, showing a power-law near the critical point, and validated theoretical steady-state predictions against simulations.

Conclusion: This work initiates a deeper understanding of kinetic energy landscapes and their relation to phase space structures in non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in
high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by
combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We
find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a
positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a
power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity
distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations
on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding
the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space
for the non-equilibrium dynamics.

*Yifan Su,Rishi Veerapaneni,Jiaoyang Li*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces the BTPG-max algorithm, improving upon previous works to efficiently handle delays in Multi-Agent Path Finding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delays in real systems often disrupt the assumptions of time-specific MAPF solutions, necessitating methods to address inter-agent collisions.

Method: The authors developed BTPG-max to locally optimize bidirectional pairs as a relaxed dependency in Temporal Plan Graphs.

Result: BTPG-max successfully increases bidirectional edges, enhances adaptability to delays, and demonstrates superior anytime performance.

Conclusion: BTPG-max improves execution robustness and efficiency in MAPF systems facing real-world delays.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) requires computing collision-free paths for
multiple agents in shared environment. Most MAPF planners assume that each
agent reaches a specific location at a specific timestep, but this is
infeasible to directly follow on real systems where delays often occur. To
address collisions caused by agents deviating due to delays, the Temporal Plan
Graph (TPG) was proposed, which converts a MAPF time dependent solution into a
time independent set of inter-agent dependencies. Recently, a Bidirectional TPG
(BTPG) was proposed which relaxed some dependencies into ``bidirectional pairs"
and improved efficiency of agents executing their MAPF solution with delays.
Our work improves upon this prior work by designing an algorithm, BPTG-max,
that finds more bidirectional pairs. Our main theoretical contribution is in
designing the BTPG-max algorithm is locally optimal, i.e. which constructs a
BTPG where no additional bidirectional pairs can be added. We also show how in
practice BTPG-max leads to BTPGs with significantly more bidirectional edges,
superior anytime behavior, and improves robustness to delays.

### [348] [Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05012)
*Ugur Cetintemel,Shu Chen,Alexander W. Lee,Deepti Raghavan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPEAR, a system to improve the management of prompts in Large Language Models (LLM) pipelines by making them structured, adaptive, and integral to execution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM pipelines rely heavily on opaque, brittle prompts, limiting optimization and runtime control in increasingly data-centric systems.

Method: SPEAR defines a prompt algebra to construct and adapt prompts. It enables runtime prompt refinement and structured prompt management. Multiple refinement modes are supported, along with optimization techniques.

Result: Preliminary experiments show the effectiveness of SPEAR's refinements and optimizations like operator fusion compared to static prompts and retries.

Conclusion: SPEAR provides a new, structured approach to prompt management in LLM pipelines, addressing issues of opacity and brittleness while enabling dynamic refinement and runtime optimization.

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

TL;DR: AgenticData introduces a natural language-question interface for data analytics, leveraging multi-agent collaboration and semantic planning to outperform competitors in analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity and cost of current unstructured data analytics systems that require expert intervention.

Method: Utilizes multi-agent collaboration involving data profiling, semantic cross-validation, and smart memory agents to process natural language queries into actionable analytics plans.

Result: Tests across three benchmarks show AgenticData delivers superior accuracy over existing methods for easy and complex tasks.

Conclusion: AgenticData simplifies data analytics with its feedback-driven and agentic model, offering an effective alternative to traditional expert-led systems.

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code
and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and
time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an
innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose
natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources
across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.
First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that
automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational
and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by
utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic
cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a
smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.
Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic
plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three
benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior
accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

### [350] [Cross-Domain Image Synthesis: Generating H&E from Multiplex Biomarker Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04734)
*Jillur Rahman Saurav,Mohammad Sadegh Nasr,Jacob M. Luber*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-level VQGAN architecture to generate virtual H&E stains from mIF images for better integration with established H&E-based analysis workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between molecular data from multiplex immunofluorescence imaging and morphological analysis using H&E stains, facilitating the use of H&E-based computer-aided diagnostic tools.

Method: The authors employed a multi-level Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to create virtual H&E stains and compared its performance with a conditional GAN (cGAN) baseline using colorectal cancer datasets.

Result: The VQGAN-generated virtual stains outperformed the cGAN baseline in downstream tasks such as nuclei segmentation and tissue classification, offering higher fidelity and better agreement with ground-truth analyses.

Conclusion: The study concludes that multi-level VQGAN is a superior approach for generating virtual H&E stains, effectively integrating molecular mIF data with established morphological workflows.

Abstract: While multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging provides deep,
spatially-resolved molecular data, integrating this information with the
morphological standard of Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) can be very important for
obtaining complementary information about the underlying tissue. Generating a
virtual H&E stain from mIF data offers a powerful solution, providing immediate
morphological context. Crucially, this approach enables the application of the
vast ecosystem of H&E-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to analyze
rich molecular data, bridging the gap between molecular and morphological
analysis. In this work, we investigate the use of a multi-level
Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) to create high-fidelity
virtual H&E stains from mIF images. We rigorously evaluated our VQGAN against a
standard conditional GAN (cGAN) baseline on two publicly available colorectal
cancer datasets, assessing performance on both image similarity and functional
utility for downstream analysis. Our results show that while both architectures
produce visually plausible images, the virtual stains generated by our VQGAN
provide a more effective substrate for computer-aided diagnosis. Specifically,
downstream nuclei segmentation and semantic preservation in tissue
classification tasks performed on VQGAN-generated images demonstrate superior
performance and agreement with ground-truth analysis compared to those from the
cGAN. This work establishes that a multi-level VQGAN is a robust and superior
architecture for generating scientifically useful virtual stains, offering a
viable pathway to integrate the rich molecular data of mIF into established and
powerful H&E-based analytical workflows.

*Pouyan Navard,Yasemin Ozkut,Srikar Adhikari,Elaine Situ-LaCasse,Josie Acuña,Adrienne Yarnish,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces ERDES, a novel open-access dataset for retinal detachment detection and macular status classification using ocular ultrasound, alongside baseline machine learning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal detachment requires immediate intervention, and macular involvement impacts treatment urgency. Current ultrasound interpretation is limited by a lack of expertise, especially in under-resourced settings, necessitating automation through deep learning.

Method: The study created ERDES, an open-access dataset with labeled ocular ultrasound video clips for retinal detachment detection and macular status classification, and established machine learning benchmarks using spatiotemporal CNN architectures.

Result: The dataset enables the development of machine learning models for retinal detachment detection and macular classification, providing baseline benchmarks for spatiotemporal CNNs.

Conclusion: ERDES addresses gaps in retinal detachment detection and macular classification using ultrasound, advancing automation in diagnostics where expertise is limited, with all resources made publicly accessible.

Abstract: Retinal detachment (RD) is a vision-threatening condition that requires
timely intervention to preserve vision. Macular involvement -- whether the
macula is still intact (macula-intact) or detached (macula-detached) -- is the
key determinant of visual outcomes and treatment urgency. Point-of-care
ultrasound (POCUS) offers a fast, non-invasive, cost-effective, and accessible
imaging modality widely used in diverse clinical settings to detect RD.
However, ultrasound image interpretation is limited by a lack of expertise
among healthcare providers, especially in resource-limited settings. Deep
learning offers the potential to automate ultrasound-based assessment of RD.
However, there are no ML ultrasound algorithms currently available for clinical
use to detect RD and no prior research has been done on assessing macular
status using ultrasound in RD cases -- an essential distinction for surgical
prioritization. Moreover, no public dataset currently supports macular-based RD
classification using ultrasound video clips. We introduce Eye Retinal
DEtachment ultraSound, ERDES, the first open-access dataset of ocular
ultrasound clips labeled for (i) presence of retinal detachment and (ii)
macula-intact versus macula-detached status. The dataset is intended to
facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models for
detecting retinal detachment. We also provide baseline benchmarks using
multiple spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. All
clips, labels, and training code are publicly available at

*Timothy Fei Truong Jr,Tristan Bepler*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoET-2, a multimodal protein foundation model excelling at zero-shot variant effect prediction and representation of sequence-function relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in mutation understanding and representation quality in protein language models despite scaling improvements.

Method: The paper combines retrieval augmentation with multimodal modeling, employing a hierarchical transformer and dual decoder architecture for generative and bidirectional learning.

Result: PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in variant effect prediction, particularly in challenging scenarios, and surpasses previous methods on small dataset sequence-function learning.

Conclusion: Integrating retrieval augmentation enables significant advancements in protein foundation modeling, demonstrating improved prediction and representation quality.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) learn probability distributions over natural
protein sequences. By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein
sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works
have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does
not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for
protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal,
retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context
learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure
conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2
uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context
ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language
modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and
bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring
variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised
settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning
sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work
highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal,
family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.

Motivation: To optimize training speed and minimize test errors in financial forecasting using S&P 500 data.

Method: Compared Adam, RMSProp, and Lion optimizers in forecasting tasks and introduced a new optimizer named Roaree.

Result: Adam and RMSProp produced lowest test errors while Lion had the fastest training. The novel Roaree optimizer balances training speed and stability.

Conclusion: Roaree improves training by reducing oscillatory loss behavior while maintaining speed advantages.

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of several optimizers on the task of forecasting
S&P 500 Index returns with the MambaStock model. Among the most widely used
algorithms, gradient-smoothing and adaptive-rate optimizers (for example, Adam
and RMSProp) yield the lowest test errors. In contrast, the Lion optimizer
offers notably faster training. To combine these advantages, we introduce a
novel family of optimizers, Roaree, that dampens the oscillatory loss behavior
often seen with Lion while preserving its training speed.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) for RF sensing, addressing issues of adverse propagation channels and jamming attacks using deep reinforcement learning and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in RF sensing accuracy caused by unpredictable radio environments, signal fading, noise, and potential jamming attacks.

Method: The paper employs distributed RIMSA receivers with programmable beamforming patterns, using a DRL algorithm for optimization and a neural network for signal-to-outcome mapping. A combined loss function addresses Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR).

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed RIMSA system outperforms centralized implementations in efficiency and resilience to environmental factors. It also sustains high accuracy under jamming attacks.

Conclusion: Distributed RIMSA, complemented by DRL and neural network methodologies, is a promising approach for robust and accurate RF sensing in challenging environments.

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

Result: The proposed models show competitive or superior performance compared to traditional regressors, excelling particularly in predicting yield strength and UTS/YS ratio.

Conclusion: Advanced modeling approaches can effectively capture complex relationships in HEA compositions, aiding in predictive property modeling.

Abstract: Structural High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are crucial in advancing technology
across various sectors, including aerospace, automotive, and defense
industries. However, the scarcity of integrated chemistry, process, structure,

modeling. Given the vast design space of these alloys, uncovering the
underlying patterns is essential yet difficult, requiring advanced methods

several sensitivity analyses, highlighting key elemental contributions to
mechanical behavior, including insights into the compositional factors
associated with brittle and fractured responses observed during nanoindentation
testing in the BIRDSHOT center NiCoFeCrVMnCuAl system dataset. Several encoder
decoder based chemistry property models, carefully tuned through Bayesian multi

particularly for yield strength and the UTS/YS ratio, demonstrating their
effectiveness in capturing complex composition property relationships.

*Frank Nielsen*

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to improve the understanding and applicability of the geometric Jensen-Shannon divergence (G-JSD) by tailoring it to broader contexts, such as positive densities and non-normalized mixtures.

Method: The authors propose the extended G-JSD, compare it with the conventional G-JSD, derive bounds, and provide closed-form solutions for multivariate Gaussian distributions.

Result: The extended G-JSD generalizes the traditional G-JSD, featuring bounds and closed-form expressions. It also illustrates how both versions act as regularizations of the standard JSD.

Conclusion: The paper broadens the applicability of G-JSD with the extended version, offering a deeper insight into its mathematical relationships and practical implications, especially for Gaussian distributions.

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

*Iyiola E. Olatunji,Franziska Boenisch,Jing Xu,Adam Dziedzic*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the adversarial robustness of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with graph-structured data and introduces a defense framework called GALGUARD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of LLMs with graph-structured data improves task performance but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks had not been studied.

Method: The study systematically analyzes adversarial attacks on two graph-aware LLMs (LLAGA and GRAPHPROMPTER) and proposes an end-to-end defense framework, GALGUARD.

Result: LLAGA's node sequence template is more vulnerable, GRAPHPROMPTER's GNN encoder showed greater robustness, and both models were susceptible to feature perturbation attacks.

Conclusion: While graph-aware LLMs exhibit vulnerabilities to both existing and new adversarial attacks, the proposed GALGUARD defense framework shows potential in mitigating these risks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with
graph-structured data for tasks like node classification, a domain
traditionally dominated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While this integration
leverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their
robustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first
step to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing
adversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for
poisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two
representative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.
2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an
attacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence
template to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals
that certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with
specific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its
vulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater
robustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature
perturbation attacks. Finally, we propose an end-to-end defense framework
GALGUARD, that combines an LLM-based feature correction module to mitigate
feature-level perturbations and adapted GNN defenses to protect against
structural attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency, and identifying effective incident response actions for complex systems remains a challenge. The authors aim to leverage LLMs to assist security operators in overcoming these challenges.

Result: The method achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times compared to other frontier LLMs and generalizes well to various incident types and actions, as demonstrated in evaluations using incident logs.

Conclusion: A reliable and efficient LLM-based incident response planning method is presented, with bounded hallucination probabilities, lightweight requirements, and promising performance improvements.

Abstract: Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing
frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for
complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to
mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large
language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling.
Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current
methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is
costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting
a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced
hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information
retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response
plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can
be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under
certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can
run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents
reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a)
achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes
to a broad range of incident types and response actions.

### [359] [Towards Human-Centric Evaluation of Interaction-Aware Automated Vehicle Controllers: A Framework and Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05497)
*Federico Scarì,Olger Siebinga,Arkady Zgonnikov*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a structured framework for evaluating automated vehicle controllers by considering human-centric interaction metrics alongside traditional performance measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating how automated vehicles interact with human-driven vehicles, emphasizing the human-centered aspects missing in current approaches.

Method: A framework was created with four domains—interaction effect, interaction perception, interaction effort, and interaction ability. Metrics from each domain were applied in a driving simulator case study evaluating AV controllers in merging scenarios.

Result: The study found that including these four domains in evaluations highlights differences in driver experiences when interacting with AVs, which were overlooked in traditional technical assessments.

Conclusion: A holistic evaluation framework is crucial for developing AVs that are functionally capable and perceived as safe, understandable, and acceptable by humans.

Abstract: As automated vehicles (AVs) increasingly integrate into mixed-traffic
environments, evaluating their interaction with human-driven vehicles (HDVs)
becomes critical. In most research focused on developing new AV control
algorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed
solely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping
efficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of
interaction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework
that addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot
interaction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction
effect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction
ability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on
human drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply
it to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts
with human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring
HDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative
metric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how
participants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,
aggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.
The results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the
evaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver
experience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more
comprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,
developers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour
beyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not
only functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a
human perspective.

*Carlo Esposito*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study finds that users prefer concise and source-attributed AI search responses over elaborate ones, challenging the assumption that complexity signifies better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address user dissatisfaction with verbose responses from AI-powered search systems and understand optimal communication strategies.

Method: Study of 10,000 participants comparing responses from five AI-powered search systems while analyzing user preferences.

Result: Users preferred clear, concise, and sourced responses; verbose explanations caused trust to decline and cognitive load to increase.

Conclusion: Effective AI communication should prioritize brevity, transparency, and proper source attribution for better engagement and reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in search applications increasingly prioritize
verbose, lexically complex responses that paradoxically reduce user
satisfaction and engagement. Through a comprehensive study of 10.000 (est.)
participants comparing responses from five major AI-powered search systems, we
demonstrate that users overwhelmingly prefer concise, source-attributed
responses over elaborate explanations. Our analysis reveals that current AI
development trends toward "artificial sophistication" create an uncanny valley
effect where systems sound knowledgeable but lack genuine critical thinking,
leading to reduced trust and increased cognitive load. We present evidence that
optimal AI communication mirrors effective human discourse: direct, properly
sourced, and honest about limitations. Our findings challenge the prevailing
assumption that more complex AI responses indicate better performance, instead
suggesting that human-like brevity and transparency are key to user engagement
and system reliability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if embedding reflection prompts in AI-driven podcasts enhances learning and user experience.

Method: Compared learning outcomes and user experience across podcast conditions with and without LLM-guided reflection prompts.

Result: Reflection prompts did not improve learning and decreased perceived attractiveness.

Conclusion: Further research is required on designing effective reflective interactivity in AI-enabled platforms.

Abstract: This study examined whether embedding LLM-guided reflection prompts in an
interactive AI-generated podcast improved learning and user experience compared

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges posed by LLMs like ChatGPT, which simulate coherence without adhering to traditional knowledge validation modes, exposing the fragility of current knowledge infrastructures.

Method: The authors propose the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework, integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology to trace credibility mediation across various systems.

Result: The SEI framework shifts focus from stable scholarly domains to dynamic arrangements of credibility mediation, suggesting alternative approaches to epistemic stewardship in hybrid systems.

Conclusion: The paper argues for adaptive and anticipatory models of knowledge infrastructure governance, contributing to discussions on AI ethics, knowledge production, and scholarly communication models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the
fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence
while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This
paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a
diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid
human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on
stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how
credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal
arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform
theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over
classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of
epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance,
knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering
a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address difficulties in discovering and applying schemas, which are crucial for organizing ideas and creative pursuits in complex scenarios.

Method: The method involves designing systems that help users extract schemas from examples and operationalize them into workflows for human-AI co-creation.

Conclusion: Schema-guided systems foster transparency and collaboration in human-AI interaction, enhancing creative problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Humans often rely on underlying structural patterns-schemas-to create,

research develops a framework for human-AI schema discovery and application to
support creative problem solving. I design systems that support users in
sensemaking over examples to abstract schemas, and in operationalizing schemas
into human-AI co-creative workflows for application. This research offers
insights into how schema-guided interaction can make implicit knowledge more
accessible and actionable, advancing more transparent and collaborative
human-AI systems.

### [364] [CWEFS: Brain volume conduction effects inspired channel-wise EEG feature selection for multi-dimensional emotion recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05228)
*Xueyuan Xu,Wenjia Dong,Fulin Wei,Li Zhuo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method, called Channel-Wise EEG Feature Selection (CWEFS), for improving emotional recognition in EEG data through smarter feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in emotion recognition stemming from irrelevant and redundant data in high-dimensional EEG features.

Method: CWEFS integrates feature selection with latent structure modeling and adaptive channel-weight learning to identify the most significant EEG channels for emotion recognition.

Result: Experimental tests on three EEG datasets showed CWEFS outperformed nineteen other feature selection approaches across six evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The CWEFS method effectively refines EEG feature selection for optimal emotional representation and recognition, highlighting its potential for multi-dimensional affective computing.

Abstract: Due to the intracranial volume conduction effects, high-dimensional
multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) features often contain substantial
redundant and irrelevant information. This issue not only hinders the
extraction of discriminative emotional representations but also compromises the
real-time performance. Feature selection has been established as an effective
approach to address the challenges while enhancing the transparency and
interpretability of emotion recognition models. However, existing EEG feature
selection research overlooks the influence of latent EEG feature structures on
emotional label correlations and assumes uniform importance across various
channels, directly limiting the precise construction of EEG feature selection
models for multi-dimensional affective computing. To address these limitations,
a novel channel-wise EEG feature selection (CWEFS) method is proposed for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition. Specifically, inspired by brain volume
conduction effects, CWEFS integrates EEG emotional feature selection into a
shared latent structure model designed to construct a consensus latent space
across diverse EEG channels. To preserve the local geometric structure, this
consensus space is further integrated with the latent semantic analysis of
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Additionally, CWEFS incorporates adaptive
channel-weight learning to automatically determine the significance of
different EEG channels in the emotional feature selection task. The
effectiveness of CWEFS was validated using three popular EEG datasets with
multi-dimensional emotional labels. Comprehensive experimental results,
compared against nineteen feature selection methods, demonstrate that the EEG
feature subsets chosen by CWEFS achieve optimal emotion recognition performance
across six evaluation metrics.

*Tianze Yu,Junming Zhang,Wenjia Dong,Xueyuan Xu,Li Zhuo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper discusses a novel algorithm to tackle EEG-based emotion recognition challenges by improving label recovery and feature selection, addressing issues of high dimensionality and incomplete emotional labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of classifier overfitting, high computational complexity, and incomplete emotional label data in EEG-based multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

Method: The paper introduces an incomplete multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm integrating adaptive dual self-expression learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression, enabling information cross-sharing between sample-level and dimension-level processes for better label reconstruction.

Result: The proposed method enhances label recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The approach addresses the challenges in existing methods, offering improved generalization and feature selection for EEG-based emotion recognition under incomplete label conditions.

Abstract: EEG based multi-dimension emotion recognition has attracted substantial
research interest in human computer interfaces. However, the high
dimensionality of EEG features, coupled with limited sample sizes, frequently
leads to classifier overfitting and high computational complexity. Feature
selection constitutes a critical strategy for mitigating these challenges. Most
existing EEG feature selection methods assume complete multi-dimensional
emotion labels. In practice, open acquisition environment, and the inherent
subjectivity of emotion perception often result in incomplete label data, which
can compromise model generalization. Additionally, existing feature selection
methods for handling incomplete multi-dimensional labels primarily focus on
correlations among various dimensions during label recovery, neglecting the
correlation between samples in the label space and their interaction with
various dimensions. To address these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
multi-dimensional feature selection algorithm for EEG-based emotion
recognition. The proposed method integrates an adaptive dual self-expression
learning (ADSEL) with least squares regression. ADSEL establishes a
bidirectional pathway between sample-level and dimension-level self-expression
learning processes within the label space. It could facilitate the
cross-sharing of learned information between these processes, enabling the
simultaneous exploitation of effective information across both samples and
dimensions for label reconstruction. Consequently, ADSEL could enhances label
recovery accuracy and effectively identifies the optimal EEG feature subset for
multi-dimensional emotion recognition.

### [366] [FDC-Net: Rethinking the association between EEG artifact removal and multi-dimensional affective computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05231)
*Wenjia Dong,Xueyuan Xu,Tianze Yu,Junming Zhang,Li Zhuo*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes FDC-Net, a framework for end-to-end EEG-based emotion recognition that deeply integrates denoising and emotion classification tasks. It outperforms existing methods on the DEAP and DREAMER datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG emotion recognition suffers from physiological artifacts, and existing methods treat denoising and recognition as separate tasks, leading to error accumulation and lack of noise robustness.

Method: The proposed FDC-Net establishes a collaborative mechanism between denoising and classification using bidirectional gradient propagation, joint optimization, and a frequency-adaptive Transformer with gated attention and learnable band-position encoding.

Result: FDC-Net achieved higher artifact removal (96.30% CC on DEAP, 90.31% CC on DREAMER) and emotion recognition accuracy (82.3% on DEAP, 88.1% on DREAMER) compared to nine state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The FDC-Net framework offers a noise-robust, end-to-end solution, improving both artifact removal and emotion recognition in EEG-based systems.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition holds significant value
in affective computing and brain-computer interfaces. However, in practical
applications, EEG recordings are susceptible to the effects of various
physiological artifacts. Current approaches typically treat denoising and
emotion recognition as independent tasks using cascaded architectures, which
not only leads to error accumulation, but also fails to exploit potential
synergies between these tasks. Moreover, conventional EEG-based emotion
recognition models often rely on the idealized assumption of "perfectly
denoised data", lacking a systematic design for noise robustness. To address
these challenges, a novel framework that deeply couples denoising and emotion
recognition tasks is proposed for end-to-end noise-robust emotion recognition,
termed as Feedback-Driven Collaborative Network for Denoising-Classification
Nexus (FDC-Net). Our primary innovation lies in establishing a dynamic
collaborative mechanism between artifact removal and emotion recognition
through: (1) bidirectional gradient propagation with joint optimization
strategies; (2) a gated attention mechanism integrated with frequency-adaptive
Transformer using learnable band-position encoding. Two most popular EEG-based
emotion datasets (DEAP and DREAMER) with multi-dimensional emotional labels
were employed to compare the artifact removal and emotion recognition
performance between ASLSL and nine state-of-the-art methods. In terms of the
denoising task, FDC-Net obtains a maximum correlation coefficient (CC) value of
96.30% on DEAP and a maximum CC value of 90.31% on DREAMER. In terms of the
emotion recognition task under physiological artifact interference, FDC-Net
achieves emotion recognition accuracies of 82.3+7.1% on DEAP and 88.1+0.8% on
DREAMER.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to offer "humanized" persuasive advice, aiding drivers in Level 3 automated driving systems to maintain attention and transition smoothly during emergencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drivers of Level 3 automated systems may neglect road conditions owing to reliance on automation, risking delayed responses during emergencies. The paper aims to mitigate this by enhancing driver alertness using persuasive advice.

Method: The study integrates an LLM-driven tool that uses road condition data as triggers to deliver visual and auditory cues. This helps drivers manage attention effectively between driving tasks and secondary activities.

Result: Empirical findings demonstrate that the tool successfully maintains driver attention with lower cognitive burden and aids in coordinating secondary tasks during driver takeover scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-based tools hold promise in enhancing attentiveness and safety in automated driving systems by offering effective assistance during multi-tasking scenarios.

Abstract: Level 3 automated driving systems allows drivers to engage in secondary tasks
while diminishing their perception of risk. In the event of an emergency
necessitating driver intervention, the system will alert the driver with a
limited window for reaction and imposing a substantial cognitive burden. To
address this challenge, this study employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
assist drivers in maintaining an appropriate attention on road conditions
through a "humanized" persuasive advice. Our tool leverages the road conditions
encountered by Level 3 systems as triggers, proactively steering driver
behavior via both visual and auditory routes. Empirical study indicates that
our tool is effective in sustaining driver attention with reduced cognitive
load and coordinating secondary tasks with takeover behavior. Our work provides
insights into the potential of using LLMs to support drivers during multi-task
automated driving.

TL;DR: Graffiti is a system designed for creating diverse, personalized social applications that can interoperate while preserving user data and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rethink rigid social application designs and address challenges in building flexible, interoperable social platforms.

Method: A new system built around concepts like total reification and channels alongside a minimal client-side API and a Vue.js plugin.

Result: Graffiti enables user movement across varied designs and allows for decentralized implementations, demonstrated via case studies of different applications.

Conclusion: Graffiti fosters a broader ecosystem of personalized, interoperable social applications while preventing issues like context collapse.

Abstract: Most social applications, from Twitter to Wikipedia, have rigid
one-size-fits-all designs, but building new social applications is both
technically challenging and results in applications that are siloed away from
existing communities. We present Graffiti, a system that can be used to build a
wide variety of personalized social applications with relative ease that also
interoperate with each other. People can freely move between a plurality of
designs -- each with its own aesthetic, feature set, and moderation -- all
without losing their friends or data.
  Our concept of total reification makes it possible for seemingly
contradictory designs, including conflicting moderation rules, to interoperate.
Conversely, our concept of channels prevents interoperation from occurring by
accident, avoiding context collapse.
  Graffiti applications interact through a minimal client-side API, which we
show admits at least two decentralized implementations. Above the API, we built
a Vue.js plugin, which we use to develop applications similar to Twitter,
Messenger, and Wikipedia using only client-side code. Our case studies explore
how these and other novel applications interoperate, as well as the broader
ecosystem that Graffiti enables.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient method for constructing representative states from all key SLOCC classes of four-qubit entanglement, enabling deeper exploration of entangled properties and facilitating experimental realizations.

Method: Utilized a Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm to construct 4-qubit entangled states, complemented by state-link graphs (SLGs) to visualize and optimize quantum gate configurations.

Result: The algorithm successfully synthesized quantum circuits for all nine entanglement families in an optimal manner with respect to chosen quantum gate sets.

Conclusion: The SLGs combined with the Q-learning algorithm provide an intuitive resource for building and understanding entangled quantum states, offering potential for experimental quantum state realizations and broader insights.

Abstract: We have devised an artificial intelligence algorithm with machine
reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to construct remarkable entangled states
with 4 qubits. This way, the algorithm is able to generate representative
states for some of the 49 true SLOCC classes of the four-qubit entanglement
states. In particular, it is possible to reach at least one true SLOCC class
for each of the nine entanglement families. The quantum circuits synthesized by
the algorithm may be useful for the experimental realization of these important
classes of entangled states and to draw conclusions about the intrinsic
properties of our universe. We introduce a graphical tool called the state-link
graph (SLG) to represent the construction of the Quality matrix (Q-matrix) used
by the algorithm to build a given objective state belonging to the
corresponding entanglement class. This allows us to discover the necessary
connections between specific entanglement features and the role of certain
quantum gates that the algorithm needs to include in the quantum gate set of
actions. The quantum circuits found are optimal by construction with respect to
the quantum gate-set chosen. These SLGs make the algorithm simple, intuitive
and a useful resource for the automated construction of entangled states with a
low number of qubits.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for quantum circuit synthesis, focusing on generating minimal-depth circuits for target quantum states using Q-learning and state-space simplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently synthesizing quantum circuits for target states, a crucial need in both the NISQ era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: The paper uses tabular Q-learning in a discretized quantum state space, coupled with a hybrid reward system combining static rewards and penalties for inefficient circuit structures.

Result: The method demonstrated its capability to produce minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts, successfully handling tasks like graph-state preparation for up to seven qubits.

Conclusion: The RL framework proves robust and adaptable, efficiently exploring complex quantum state spaces to synthesize resource-efficient, near-optimal quantum circuits.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) in time series forecasting, aiming to minimize privacy concerns without significantly impairing model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing privacy and utility in time series forecasting, especially in sensitive domains like finance and energy systems, where private data needs strong protection.

Method: Q-DPTS integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise to achieve rigorous differential privacy while mitigating the adverse effects of privacy noise.

Result: Evaluation on the ETT benchmark dataset shows Q-DPTS consistently yielding lower prediction errors compared to classical and quantum baselines under the same privacy settings, indicating superior performance and an improved privacy-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of quantum models in enhancing the trade-off between privacy and utility in time series forecasting, promoting secure data handling in privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

Motivation: The motivation is to address complex tasks in aeroelasticity, such as binary classification and regression, by utilizing the abilities of QML.

Method: The method combines tensor networks with variational quantum circuits. Time series data is encoded into tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, transformed into quantum circuits, and then processed by a tensor network-inspired variational quantum circuit.

Result: The proposed hybrid quantum tensor networks achieved high accuracy in binary classification and showed promise in regressing discrete variables.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum tensor networks in aeroelasticity while acknowledging challenges such as optimizing hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: We investigate the application of hybrid quantum tensor networks to

By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate
the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and
regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor
networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we
observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While
hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to
unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly
to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We
present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series
into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for
dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit
in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational
quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate
or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.

Motivation: Limitations of large language models in quantum sensor development due to interdisciplinary challenges and complex optimization processes.

Method: QCopilot leverages multi-agent systems, few-shot prompt engineering, a vector knowledge base, specialized agents for adaptive optimization, modeling analysis, and problem diagnosis.

Result: QCopilot demonstrated autonomous performance in atom cooling experiments, achieving sub-$μ$K temperatures with 100x speedup compared to manual experimentation.

Conclusion: QCopilot reduces barriers for quantum sensor deployment by enabling dynamic modeling, autonomous experimentation, and anomalous parameter identification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in
quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers
and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an
LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active
learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and
diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and
vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select
optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform
problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated
10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a
few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation.
Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic
modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in

### [374] [On the Design of Expressive and Trainable Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05559)
*Han-Xiao Tao,Xin Wang,Re-Bing Wu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning models are hardware-efficient but face challenges balancing expressivity and trainability due to dynamic symmetry. This paper presents a necessary condition to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in pulse-based QML models, specifically the trade-off between expressivity and trainability, which affects their practical applications.

Method: It introduces a necessary condition derived from analyzing the initial state, measurement observable, and dynamical symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations.

Result: The study identifies factors that influence the balance between expressivity and trainability in pulse-based QML models, providing insights into their design.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for designing pulse-based QML models that optimize hardware efficiency while ensuring both expressivity and trainability.

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in
quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For
practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and
trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic
symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that
has no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise
expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates
the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving
trainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's
initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical
symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings
establish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that
balance expressivity and trainability.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a low-latency AI voice agent pipeline for telecom, combining specialized AI models for call center automation and intelligent voice responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance real-time, domain-specific AI voice agent capabilities for telecom applications such as customer support and diagnostics.

Method: The pipeline integrates four specialized NetoAI models (TSLAM, T-VEC, TTE, T-Synth) to enable streaming ASR, conversational intelligence, and real-time TTS.

Result: Evaluation using a dataset of 500 telecom questions showed low latency (RTFs below 1.0) for real-time telecom applications.

Conclusion: The system sets a benchmark for low-latency voice assistants in telecom, supporting automated and intelligent customer service tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time,
interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center
automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven
customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized
models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language
Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific
Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive,
domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken
interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE),
conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over
telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for
telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500
human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent
queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and
real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and
T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise,
low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and
T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling

### [376] [Wearable Music2Emotion : Assessing Emotions Induced by AI-Generated Music through Portable EEG-fNIRS Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04723)
*Sha Zhao,Song Yi,Yangxuan Zhou,Jiadong Pan,Jiquan Wang,Jie Xia,Shijian Li,Shurong Dong,Gang Pan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces MEEtBrain, a portable framework for emotion analysis using AI-generated music and multimodal neurophysiological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the need for portable, scalable, and personalized music-based emotion analysis tools while overcoming limitations like restricted music stimuli, unimodal data reliance, and lack of real-world portability.

Method: The researchers developed MEEtBrain, which combines AI-generated music stimuli with simultaneous EEG and fNIRS data collection using a wireless, portable headband.

Result: A 14-hour dataset from 20 participants showed the framework's efficacy in eliciting target emotions. The dataset has since been expanded to 44 participants and is publicly available.

Conclusion: MEEtBrain demonstrates a scalable, practical approach to advancing emotion analysis through music and neurophysiological data, promoting further research and applications.

Abstract: Emotions critically influence mental health, driving interest in music-based
affective computing via neurophysiological signals with Brain-computer
Interface techniques. While prior studies leverage music's accessibility for
emotion induction, three key limitations persist: \textbf{(1) Stimulus
Constraints}: Music stimuli are confined to small corpora due to copyright and
curation costs, with selection biases from heuristic emotion-music mappings
that ignore individual affective profiles. \textbf{(2) Modality Specificity}:
Overreliance on unimodal neural data (e.g., EEG) ignores complementary insights
from cross-modal signal fusion.\textbf{ (3) Portability Limitation}: Cumbersome
setups (e.g., 64+ channel gel-based EEG caps) hinder real-world applicability
due to procedural complexity and portability barriers. To address these
limitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for
emotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with
synchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the
music stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale,
eliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity. We use
our developed portable device that is designed in a lightweight headband-style
and uses dry electrodes, to simultaneously collect EEG and fNIRS recordings. A
14-hour dataset from 20 participants was collected in the first recruitment to
validate the framework's efficacy, with AI-generated music eliciting target
emotions (valence/arousal). We are actively expanding our multimodal dataset
(44 participants in the latest dataset) and make it publicly available to
promote further research and practical applications. \textbf{The dataset is
available at https://zju-bmi-lab.github.io/ZBra.

### [378] [Towards Hallucination-Free Music: A Reinforcement Learning Preference Optimization Framework for Reliable Song Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05011)
*Huaicheng Zhang,Wei Tan,Guangzheng Li,Yixuan Zhang,Hangting Chen,Shun Lei,Chenyu Yang,Zhiyong Wu,Shuai Wang,Qijun Huang,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper addresses content hallucination in AI-driven lyric-to-song models using a reinforcement learning framework with preference optimization strategies to improve alignment between lyrics and generated music.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lyric-to-song generation models often create outputs misaligned with input lyrics, known as content hallucination, hindering musical coherence. Existing supervised fine-tuning methods fail to effectively reduce these hallucinations.

Method: The authors developed a novel reinforcement learning framework using preference optimization strategies. They created a hallucination preference dataset based on phoneme error rates and implemented three RL approaches: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for controlling hallucination.

Result: DPO reduced phoneme error rate (PER) by 7.4% using an off-policy approach. PPO and GRPO showed PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7% respectively through on-policy training and reward maximization.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based framework effectively reduces hallucinations in lyric-to-song models while maintaining musical quality. This approach offers transferability for broader applications in music style adherence and enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-based generative language models have accelerated
AI-driven lyric-to-song generation. However, these models frequently suffer
from content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics
and undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained
self-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core
challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging
preference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions
include: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed
via phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture
alignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three
distinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance
positive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and
GRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to
iteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization,
yielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Comprehensive objective
and subjective evaluations confirm that our methods effectively suppress
hallucinations while preserving musical quality. Crucially, this work presents
a systematic, RL-based solution to hallucination control in lyric-to-song
generation. The framework's transferability also unlocks potential for music
style adherence and musicality enhancement, opening new avenues for future
generative song research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aimed to enhance neural audio codecs for reconstructing stereo music with better quality at high sample rates and low bit rates.

Method: SpectroStream introduces a new neural architecture employing time-frequency domain audio representation and a delayed-fusion strategy for multi-channel audio processing.

Result: The codec achieves high-quality audio reconstruction at 48 kHz stereo music within 4–16 kbps, exhibiting improved performance especially at higher sampling rates.

Conclusion: SpectroStream pushes forward stereo music audio coding efficiency by effectively balancing quality and bandwidth constraints using advanced neural mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose SpectroStream, a full-band multi-channel neural audio codec.
Successor to the well-established SoundStream, SpectroStream extends its
capability beyond 24 kHz monophonic audio and enables high-quality
reconstruction of 48 kHz stereo music at bit rates of 4--16 kbps. This is
accomplished with a new neural architecture that leverages audio representation
in the time-frequency domain, which leads to better audio quality especially at
higher sample rate. The model also uses a delayed-fusion strategy to handle
multi-channel audio, which is crucial in balancing per-channel acoustic quality
and cross-channel phase consistency.

TL;DR: This paper compares diffusion models to Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) for quantifying musical surprisal and expectancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enhance the modeling of musical expectancy and surprisal using alternative methods like diffusion models instead of traditional transformers.

Method: They use IC calculations from autoregressive diffusion models and test their effectiveness using two distinct diffusion ODE approaches across musical tasks.

Result: Diffusion models match or outperform GIVT in capturing pitch surprisal and detecting boundaries in audio segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that diffusion models provide better flexibility and performance for modeling musical surprisal at various noise levels, validating their hypothesis.

Abstract: Recently, the information content (IC) of predictions from a Generative
Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) has been used to model musical
expectancy and surprisal in audio. We investigate the effectiveness of such
modelling using IC calculated with autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs). We
empirically show that IC estimates of models based on two different diffusion
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe diverse data better, in terms
of negative log-likelihood, than a GIVT. We evaluate diffusion model IC's
effectiveness in capturing surprisal aspects by examining two tasks: (1)
capturing monophonic pitch surprisal, and (2) detecting segment boundaries in
multi-track audio. In both tasks, the diffusion models match or exceed the
performance of a GIVT. We hypothesize that the surprisal estimated at different
diffusion process noise levels corresponds to the surprisal of music and audio
features present at different audio granularities. Testing our hypothesis, we
find that, for appropriate noise levels, the studied musical surprisal tasks'
results improve. Code is provided on github.com/SonyCSLParis/audioic.

Result: The insights reveal benefits, uses, and current limitations, such as computational challenges and the shortage of annotated 3D Gaussian data.

Conclusion: The paper identifies open challenges and provides directions for future development of language-guided Gaussian Splatting technologies.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has rapidly emerged as a transformative technique for
real-time 3D scene representation, offering a highly efficient and expressive
alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Its ability to render complex
scenes with high fidelity has enabled progress across domains such as scene
reconstruction, robotics, and interactive content creation. More recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and language embeddings into
Gaussian Splatting pipelines has opened new possibilities for text-conditioned
generation, editing, and semantic scene understanding. Despite these advances,
a comprehensive overview of this emerging intersection has been lacking. This
survey presents a structured review of current research efforts that combine
language guidance with 3D Gaussian Splatting, detailing theoretical
foundations, integration strategies, and real-world use cases. We highlight key
limitations such as computational bottlenecks, generalizability, and the
scarcity of semantically annotated 3D Gaussian data and outline open challenges

TL;DR: The paper introduces Voost, a unified diffusion transformer framework for both virtual try-on and try-off tasks, addressing garment-body correspondence challenges with flexibility and high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling garment-body correspondence has been a persistent challenge in virtual try-on due to pose and appearance variation.

Method: The authors propose Voost, a unified framework using a single diffusion transformer to jointly learn virtual try-on and try-off tasks, coupled with inference-time techniques for improved robustness and consistency.

Result: Voost achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization on try-on and try-off benchmarks.

Conclusion: Voost enhances garment-body relational reasoning and offers robust performance without requiring task-specific networks or additional labels, making substantial advancements in virtual try-on and try-off systems.

Abstract: Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a
target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a
persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this
paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns
virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling
both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both
directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and
garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without
task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we
introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for
robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that
leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and
try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment
accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.

TL;DR: This paper presents an improved approach to managing point primitives for 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing a novel density control method guided by Gaussian function inertia volumes. It enhances reconstruction quality compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in the vanilla densification strategy of 3D Gaussian Splatting for achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and improving reconstruction across complex scenes.

Method: The proposed method refines point primitive management using a novel density control approach based on the inertia volume of Gaussian functions. Additionally, it evaluates point cloud initialization via SfM and DIM methods.

Result: Extensive experiments on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves reconstruction quality compared to existing 3DGS techniques.

Conclusion: The novel density control approach effectively enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting, providing improved performance in novel view synthesis and reconstruction across various scenes.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality novel view synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
often depends on effective point primitive management. The underlying Adaptive
Density Control (ADC) process addresses this issue by automating densification
and pruning. Yet, the vanilla 3DGS densification strategy shows key
shortcomings. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel density
control method, which exploits the volumes of inertia associated to each
Gaussian function to guide the refinement process. Furthermore, we study the
effect of both traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) and Deep Image Matching
(DIM) methods for point cloud initialization. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
3DGS in reconstruction quality, delivering encouraging performance across

TL;DR: The paper introduces a perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance memory efficiency, visual quality, and rendering speed in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches face challenges with efficient storage and scene management in large-scale environments, especially under constrained computational resources.

Method: The authors propose a framework featuring three key elements: a scene perception compensation algorithm for refining Gaussian parameters, a pyramid sampling representation for hierarchical management, and a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm for efficient storage without compromising fidelity.

Result: The proposed method achieves high memory efficiency, improved visual fidelity, and maintains real-time rendering performance, as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: This framework represents a significant advancement in 3DGS techniques, balancing resource efficiency with high-quality rendering for large-scale and complex scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in real-time and photorealistic novel view synthesis. However,
traditional 3DGS representations often struggle with large-scale scene
management and efficient storage, particularly when dealing with complex
environments or limited computational resources. To address these limitations,
we introduce a novel perceive-sample-compress framework for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. Specifically, we propose a scene perception compensation algorithm
that intelligently refines Gaussian parameters at each level. This algorithm
intelligently prioritizes visual importance for higher fidelity rendering in
critical areas, while optimizing resource usage and improving overall visible
quality. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid sampling representation to manage
Gaussian primitives across hierarchical levels. Finally, to facilitate
efficient storage of proposed hierarchical pyramid representations, we develop
a Generalized Gaussian Mixed model compression algorithm to achieve significant
compression ratios without sacrificing visual fidelity. The extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves memory

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework to better capture complex dynamic scenes by resolving spectral conflicts and reconstruction challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending 3DGS to dynamic scenes encounters issues like over-smoothing and feature collision caused by spectral conflicts. The paper aims to enhance motion detail preservation and deformation consistency.

Method: The framework introduces hybrid explicit-implicit functions featuring spectral-aware Laplacian encoding, Gaussian dynamics attributes to address distortions, and adaptive Gaussian splitting with KDTree-based primitive control.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in reconstructing complex dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The dynamic 3DGS framework effectively addresses challenges in dynamic scene modeling, offering improved performance and motion detail control through innovative techniques.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in static scene modeling, its
extension to dynamic scenes introduces significant challenges. Existing dynamic
3DGS methods suffer from either over-smoothing due to low-rank decomposition or
feature collision from high-dimensional grid sampling. This is because of the
inherent spectral conflicts between preserving motion details and maintaining
deformation consistency at different frequency. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel dynamic 3DGS framework with hybrid explicit-implicit functions.
Our approach contains three key innovations: a spectral-aware Laplacian
encoding architecture which merges Hash encoding and Laplacian-based module for
flexible frequency motion control, an enhanced Gaussian dynamics attribute that
compensates for photometric distortions caused by geometric deformation, and an
adaptive Gaussian split strategy guided by KDTree-based primitive control to
efficiently query and optimize dynamic areas. Through extensive experiments,
our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing complex
dynamic scenes, achieving better reconstruction fidelity.

TL;DR: The paper proposes RAP, a framework for generating high-quality real-time audio-driven talking portraits, using hybrid attention and a novel training-inference paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven portrait animation methods deliver high visual quality but struggle with real-time deployment due to computational complexity and reliance on high-dimensional representations.

Method: RAP employs a hybrid attention mechanism for detailed audio control and uses a static-dynamic training-inference strategy to avoid motion supervision and ensure temporal consistency.

Result: RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating talking head videos, excelling in audio-visual synchronization and maintaining visual fidelity under stringent real-time constraints.

Conclusion: RAP is a significant step towards solving real-time audio-driven portrait animation challenges, balancing computation efficiency with quality outcomes.

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural
talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image.
While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging
high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion
dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time
deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory
constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent
representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the
preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating
audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a
unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time
constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for
fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm
that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves
precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains
high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This study addresses the issue of realistic 3D cloth modeling and simulation by introducing a novel segmentation paradigm for identifying multiple overlapping clothed layers in 3D point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D shape segmentation are focused on scene interpretation and aren't specifically tailored for clothed body modeling, which requires handling overlapping layers like garments and underlying body parts.

Method: The paper proposes a novel segmentation approach for 3D point clouds that allows each point to belong to multiple layers simultaneously, enabling the identification of occluded regions and layered structures.

Result: The authors present a synthetic dataset simulating realistic 3D scans with clothing layer ground truth, and train neural networks using coarse and fine-grained garment layer identification. Results demonstrate improved segmentation performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new paradigm for handling clothing layers in 3D modeling, showing strong impact on clothed body reconstruction and advancing garment segmentation for applications in fashion and animation.

Abstract: 3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several
fields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality
results is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially
in the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more
accuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic
information that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction
pipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying
the semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are
designed for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is
devoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation
is a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the
underlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers
with strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide
disjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation
paradigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different
layers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the
unseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer
above. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a
new synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground
truth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural
network settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse
and fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates
the benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the
garment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.

*Chris Careaga,Yağız Aksoy*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for in-the-wild image relighting using a combination of physical rendering techniques and neural networks for photorealistic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to bridge the gap between physically accurate illumination control and photorealistic image appearance in real-world scenarios.

Method: The approach uses a colored mesh representation for scene geometry, self-supervised training, a path-tracing engine for rendering under new lighting conditions, and a neural renderer for photorealistic final results.

Result: The pipeline enables explicit physical control over lighting, replicating the capabilities of 3D graphics tools like Blender for real-world images.

Conclusion: This method advances towards integrating the precision of traditional rendering with the flexibility of neural networks, enabling realistic in-the-wild image relighting.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image relighting that
enables fully controllable, physically based illumination editing. We achieve
this by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the
photorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works
by inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular
estimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows
users to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under
the new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this
approximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to
predict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable
rendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling
self-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections. Our
method represents a significant step in bringing the explicit physical control
over lights available in typical 3D computer graphics tools, such as Blender,
to in-the-wild relighting.

### [389] [Learning Geometric-Aware Quadrature Rules for Functional Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05445)
*Costas Smaragdakis*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuadrANN, a Graph Neural Network for accurate integration over non-uniform point clouds, improving stability and variance reduction compared to standard Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many mesh-free machine learning solvers for PDEs face challenges in accurately integrating over non-uniform point clouds, especially using variational principles.

Method: The authors propose QuadrANN, leveraging GNNs to learn optimal quadrature weights. It uses message-passing schemes to encode local geometry, density, and global context of point clouds, resulting in permutation-invariant and adaptive quadrature rules.

Result: QuadrANN demonstrated reduced variance and improved performance compared to traditional Quasi-Monte Carlo methods in test cases, including complex PDEs and non-convex domains.

Conclusion: The developed QuadrANN architecture enhances integral estimation by adapting point density in critical integration areas, thereby stabilizing deep learning-based variational solvers.

Abstract: Accurate numerical integration over non-uniform point clouds is a challenge
for modern mesh-free machine learning solvers for partial differential
equations (PDEs) using variational principles. While standard Monte Carlo (MC)
methods are not capable of handling a non-uniform point cloud, modern neural
network architectures can deal with permutation-invariant inputs, creating
quadrature rules for any point cloud. In this work, we introduce QuadrANN, a
Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to learn optimal quadrature
weights directly from the underlying geometry of point clouds. The design of
the model exploits a deep message-passing scheme where the initial layer
encodes rich local geometric features from absolute and relative positions as
well as an explicit local density measure. In contrast, the following layers
incorporate a global context vector. These architectural choices allow the
QuadrANN to generate a data-driven quadrature rule that is
permutation-invariant and adaptive to both local point density and the overall
domain shape. We test our methodology on a series of challenging test cases,
including integration on convex and non-convex domains and estimating the
solution of the Heat and Fokker-Planck equations. Across all the tests,
QuadrANN reduces the variance of the integral estimation compared to standard
Quasi-Monte Carlo methods by warping the point clouds to be more dense in
critical areas where the integrands present certain singularities. This
enhanced stability in critical areas of the domain at hand is critical for the
optimization of energy functionals, leading to improved deep learning-based
variational solvers.

*Wanting He,Wenyuan Li,Yunran Wei*

Main category: q-fin.RM

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic risk management in defined-contribution pension funds, evaluated both periodically and at retirement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional evaluation methods by introducing a dynamic risk measure approach for pension fund performance assessments at different periods, not just at retirement.

Method: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm was used to interact with a stochastic environment, optimized for dynamic investment and insurance strategies, alongside mortality rate calibration using U.S. data and a Lee-Carter model.

Result: Periodic evaluations promoted risk-averse strategies, while enhanced mortality projections led to risk-seeking behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework improves dynamic risk management and provides deeper insights into pension fund strategy under different evaluation periods and mortality conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for the periodic evaluation of
defined-contribution pension funds. The performance of the pension fund is
evaluated not only at retirement, but also within the interim periods. In
contrast to the traditional literature, we set the dynamic risk measure as the
criterion and manage the tail risk of the pension fund dynamically. To
effectively interact with the stochastic environment, a model-free
reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to search for optimal investment
and insurance strategies. Using U.S. data, we calibrate pension members'
mortality rates and enhance mortality projections through a Lee-Carter model.
Our numerical results indicate that periodic evaluations lead to more
risk-averse strategies, while mortality improvements encourage more
risk-seeking behaviors.

Conclusion: Machine learning methods show promise as efficient and robust alternatives to Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheres, with specific combinations performing well in validation tests.

Abstract: Standard Bayesian retrievals for exoplanet atmospheric parameters from
transmission spectroscopy, while well understood and widely used, are generally
computationally expensive. In the era of the JWST and other upcoming
observatories, machine learning approaches have emerged as viable alternatives
that are both efficient and robust. In this paper we present a systematic study
of several existing machine learning regression techniques and compare their
performance for retrieving exoplanet atmospheric parameters from transmission
spectra. We benchmark the performance of the different algorithms on the
accuracy, precision, and speed. The regression methods tested here include
partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), k nearest neighbors
(KNN), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), voting (VOTE), stacking
(STACK), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We also investigate the impact of
different preprocessing methods of the training data on the model performance.
We quantify the model uncertainties across the entire dynamical range of
planetary parameters. The best performing combination of ML model and
preprocessing scheme is validated on a the case study of JWST observation of
WASP-39b.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for analyzing real-world datasets by leveraging inter-connection dynamics, beyond traditional low-conductance clustering approaches.

Method: Development of online and efficient sparsification algorithms tailored for undirected and directed graph clustering.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate accelerated performance of clustering algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets, without loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances clustering efficiency, making it valuable for large-scale graph analysis.

Abstract: Graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing massive

While the objective of most graph clustering algorithms is to find a vertex set
of low conductance, a sequence of recent studies highlights the importance of
the inter-connection between vertex sets when analysing real-world datasets.
Following this line of research, in this work we study bipartite-like clusters
and present efficient and online sparsification algorithms that find such
clusters in both undirected graphs and directed ones. We conduct experimental
studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that our algorithms
significantly speedup the running time of existing clustering algorithms while
preserving their effectiveness.

other's perspective. Past large-scale surveys have provided valuable insights,
however, the emergence of new trends (e.g., AI), new learning formats (e.g.,
in-IDE learning), and the increasing learner diversity highlight the need for
an updated comprehensive study. To address this, we conducted a survey with
18,032 learners from 173 countries, ensuring diverse representation and
exploring a wide range of topics - formal education, learning formats, AI
usage, challenges, motivation, and more. This paper introduces the results of
this survey as an open dataset, describes our methodology and the survey
questions, and highlights, as a motivating example, three possible research
directions within this data: challenges in learning, emerging formats, and
insights into the in-IDE format. The dataset aims to support further research
and foster advancements in computer education.

*Hannah-Beth Clark,Laura Benton,Emma Searle,Margaux Dowland,Matthew Gregory,Will Gayne,John Roberts*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper addresses safety concerns for AI tools in education by showcasing Oak National Academy's measures in developing Aila, a generative lesson planning tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure safe and age-appropriate AI-generated content for classroom use, aligning with the UK national curriculum.

Method: The method involves designing safety guardrails like prompt engineering, threat detection, moderation agents, and human oversight to mitigate risks in AI-driven lesson planning.

Result: Implementation of safety guardrails revealed challenges and opportunities in their effectiveness during evaluations.

Conclusion: Iterative refinement of safety measures and fostering collaboration by sharing open-source resources are crucial for improving AI tools in education.

Abstract: There has been rapid development in generative AI tools across the education
sector, which in turn is leading to increased adoption by teachers. However,
this raises concerns regarding the safety and age-appropriateness of the
AI-generated content that is being created for use in classrooms. This paper
explores Oak National Academy's approach to addressing these concerns within
the development of the UK Government's first publicly available generative AI
tool - our AI-powered lesson planning assistant (Aila). Aila is intended to
support teachers planning national curriculum-aligned lessons that are
appropriate for pupils aged 5-16 years. To mitigate safety risks associated
with AI-generated content we have implemented four key safety guardrails - (1)
prompt engineering to ensure AI outputs are generated within pedagogically
sound and curriculum-aligned parameters, (2) input threat detection to mitigate
attacks, (3) an Independent Asynchronous Content Moderation Agent (IACMA) to
assess outputs against predefined safety categories, and (4) taking a
human-in-the-loop approach, to encourage teachers to review generated content
before it is used in the classroom. Through our on-going evaluation of these
safety guardrails we have identified several challenges and opportunities to
take into account when implementing and testing safety guardrails. This paper
highlights ways to build more effective safety guardrails in generative AI
education tools including the on-going iteration and refinement of guardrails,
as well as enabling cross-sector collaboration through sharing both open-source
code, datasets and learnings.

*Wafeeq Jaleel,Md Ragib Rownak,Athar Hanif,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework to optimize energy management for series hybrid electric vehicles, achieving robust results on various driving cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of hybrid electric vehicles for heavy-duty trucks demands advanced energy management to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining battery charge.

Method: The paper enhances the Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm by integrating Gated Recurrent Units and Decision Transformers into the actor and critic networks for improved temporal planning.

Result: The proposed SAC agent with advanced actor-critic configurations achieved close to optimal fuel savings and demonstrated superior generalization on unseen driving cycles compared to traditional feedforward agents.

Conclusion: The study highlights that sequence-aware reinforcement learning models are effective in optimizing energy use and exhibit strong adaptability in real-world, diverse operational scenarios.

Abstract: As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks,
adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel
consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We
present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We
reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and
enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision
Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal
dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and
generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive
cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show
that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8%
of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test
(HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks,
and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen
drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment),
generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network
(FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in
real-world settings.

### [397] [Can SGD Handle Heavy-Tailed Noise?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04860)
*Ilyas Fatkhullin,Florian Hübler,Guanghui Lan*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper presents theoretical analysis demonstrating that vanilla stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can handle heavy-tailed noise in optimization problems, achieving optimal convergence rates even with unbounded variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding how standard vanilla SGD performs under heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning settings.

Method: The authors assume only bounded $p$-th moments for the gradients and establish convergence guarantees for SGD in convex, strongly convex, and non-convex settings. Analytical bounds are provided on convergence rates, and complementary lower bounds are derived for non-convex objectives.

Result: Vanilla SGD proves to achieve optimal sample complexity with minimal assumptions in convex and strongly convex settings—$
O(
ε^{-p/(p-1)})$ and $
O(
ε^{-p/2(p-1)})$, respectively. For non-convex objectives, the rate is $
O(
ε^{-2p/(p-1)})$, with insights for Mini-batch SGD under smoothness assumptions.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the perception that heavy-tailed noise degrades SGD's performance, showing instead that vanilla SGD is a robust, effective, and theoretically justified algorithm even with adverse stochastic conditions.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone of large-scale
optimization, yet its theoretical behavior under heavy-tailed noise -- common
in modern machine learning and reinforcement learning -- remains poorly
understood. In this work, we rigorously investigate whether vanilla SGD, devoid
of any adaptive modifications, can provably succeed under such adverse
stochastic conditions. Assuming only that stochastic gradients have bounded
$p$-th moments for some $p \in (1, 2]$, we establish sharp convergence
guarantees for (projected) SGD across convex, strongly convex, and non-convex
problem classes. In particular, we show that SGD achieves minimax optimal
sample complexity under minimal assumptions in the convex and strongly convex
regimes: $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{p-1}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{p}{2(p-1)}})$, respectively. For non-convex
objectives under H\"older smoothness, we prove convergence to a stationary
point with rate $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$, and complement
this with a matching lower bound specific to SGD with arbitrary polynomial
step-size schedules. Finally, we consider non-convex Mini-batch SGD under
standard smoothness and bounded central moment assumptions, and show that it
also achieves a comparable $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}})$ sample
complexity with a potential improvement in the smoothness constant. These
results challenge the prevailing view that heavy-tailed noise renders SGD
ineffective, and establish vanilla SGD as a robust and theoretically principled
baseline -- even in regimes where the variance is unbounded.

### [398] [Exact and Heuristic Algorithms for Constrained Biclustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05493)
*Antonio M. Sudoso*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses biclustering with pairwise constraints and proposes exact and heuristic algorithms, showing superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing biclustering with background knowledge via pairwise constraints to improve solution quality and interpretability.

Method: Developing a branch-and-cut algorithm using semidefinite programming (SDP) for exact solutions and a low-rank factorization heuristic with augmented Lagrangian methods for efficiency.

Result: Exact methods outperform general-purpose solvers, and heuristics provide efficient, high-quality solutions for large datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates constraints into biclustering, achieving high-quality outcomes in experiments.

Abstract: Biclustering, also known as co-clustering or two-way clustering,
simultaneously partitions the rows and columns of a data matrix to reveal
submatrices with coherent patterns. Incorporating background knowledge into
clustering to enhance solution quality and interpretability has attracted
growing interest in mathematical optimization and machine learning research.
Extending this paradigm to biclustering enables prior information to guide the
joint grouping of rows and columns. We study constrained biclustering with
pairwise constraints, namely must-link and cannot-link constraints, which
specify whether objects should belong to the same or different biclusters. As a
model problem, we address the constrained version of the k-densest disjoint
biclique problem, which aims to identify k disjoint complete bipartite
subgraphs (called bicliques) in a weighted complete bipartite graph, maximizing
the total density while satisfying pairwise constraints. We propose both exact
and heuristic algorithms. The exact approach is a tailored branch-and-cut
algorithm based on a low-dimensional semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation,
strengthened with valid inequalities and solved in a cutting-plane fashion.
Exploiting integer programming tools, a rounding scheme converts SDP solutions
into feasible biclusterings at each node. For large-scale instances, we
introduce an efficient heuristic based on the low-rank factorization of the
SDP. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is tackled with an augmented
Lagrangian method, where the subproblem is solved by decomposition through a
block-coordinate projected gradient algorithm. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the exact method significantly
outperforms general-purpose solvers, while the heuristic achieves high-quality
solutions efficiently on large instances.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes time series forecasting methods to predict deformation in salt rocks under variable conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding deformation trends of salt rocks is crucial for safe underground storage of hazardous materials like nuclear waste.

Method: The study assessed salt rock creep using MSTL data and compared advanced DNN models against traditional analytical models for prediction accuracy.

Result: The N-BEATS and TCN models surpassed other methods, offering a 15-20% improvement in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: DNN models, especially N-BEATS and TCN, are effective tools for modeling complex deformation trends in salt rocks and can guide safer storage facility designs.

Abstract: This study provides an in-depth analysis of time series forecasting methods
to predict the time-dependent deformation trend (also known as creep) of salt
rock under varying confining pressure conditions. Creep deformation assessment
is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for
nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for
their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high
ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined
using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain
datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure
levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including
Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed
minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data.
Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test,
confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and
wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of
deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time
Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against
statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results
demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various
stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a
15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models,
effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel generative model inspired by the damped wave equation (telegrapher's equation), offering advantages over traditional diffusion models through bounded velocity and Lipschitz continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in flow-based generative modeling, specifically limitations in diffusion models such as unbounded velocity and continuity issues.

Method: The authors leverage the stochastic Kac process, demonstrate its relation to the telegrapher's equation, extend it to multi-dimensional stochastic processes, and train a neural network via flow matching to approximate the velocity field for generative sampling.

Result: The proposed approach is shown to scale effectively and outperform standard diffusion models through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study presents a more mathematically stable and scalable alternative to diffusion models for generative tasks, based on physical principles like the telegrapher's equation.

Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model
based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation.
Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac
type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process
in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability
flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to
diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the
Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these
considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of
independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this
process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space
and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point
analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network
that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its
advantages over diffusion models.

*Wuqiang Zheng,Yiyan Xu,Xinyu Lin,Chongming Gao,Wenjie Wang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The PaperEval framework utilizes enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated academic paper evaluation and recommendation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently identify high-quality academic research amidst a rapidly increasing volume of publications.

Method: PaperEval combines domain-aware paper retrieval and latent reasoning mechanisms, enhanced by a progressive ranking optimization strategy.

Result: PaperEval achieves superior performance in academic impact and paper quality evaluations while gaining significant user engagement in real-world deployments.

Conclusion: PaperEval is an effective and scalable solution for evaluating and recommending high-quality academic papers, showing both methodological and practical success.

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes HorizonRec, a new method for cross-domain sequential recommendation leveraging dual-oriented diffusion models to harmonize user preferences across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data sparsity and interest drift in personalized sequential recommendation by enhancing modeling across multiple domains.

Method: Uses dual-oriented diffusion models to align and fuse user preferences across domains, employing a mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy and preference diffusion techniques.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance and robustness in multi-domain user preference fusion through experiments on four datasets from two platforms.

Conclusion: HorizonRec provides a more effective and stable approach to modeling cross-domain preferences, outperforming existing methods in CDSR tasks.

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for
users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and
interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary
behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing
cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an
align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across
multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking
the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent
advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an
align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via
dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the
uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of
instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a
mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions
retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across
domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we
propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise
and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation
fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained
triple-domain preference fusion.

Method: The study constructs a dataset (TDI300K) for training a dependency discriminator, represents tools as a dependency graph, and uses graph convolution for better representations.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved performance of TGR over prominent methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

Conclusion: TGR and its dependency-based approach enhance tool retrieval effectiveness, emphasizing the significance of considering tool dependencies.

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped
tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the
limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient
tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on
semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve
relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,
overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of
prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in
this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the
dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.
First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for
identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool
dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into
their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed
for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets
show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant
methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify
the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.

### [404] [Balancing Accuracy and Novelty with Sub-Item Popularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05198)
*Chiara Mallamaci,Aleksandr Vladimirovich Petrov,Alberto Carlo Maria Mancino,Vito Walter Anelli,Tommaso Di Noia,Craig Macdonald*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of repetitive listening behaviors in music recommendations by introducing a novel sub-ID-level personalized popularity scoring (sPPS) approach within the RecJPQ framework. This method improves recommendation accuracy while boosting novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Repetitive listening in music recommendations often limits novelty and discovery because existing methods like Personalized Popularity Scores focus heavily on historically frequent items.

Method: The authors repurpose the Transformer-based RecJPQ framework by introducing sub-ID-level personalized popularity scoring (sPPS). This enables finer granularity in capturing shared repetition patterns and allows explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and novelty.

Result: The proposed sPPS method outperforms traditional item-level PPS by achieving better personalized novelty without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: sPPS leverages sub-item decomposition to enhance user satisfaction by improving both recommendation accuracy and the novelty of suggested items. The approach is validated with publicly accessible experiments and code.

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

### [405] [Scaling Generative Recommendations with Context Parallelism on Hierarchical Sequential Transducers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04711)
*Yue Dong,Han Li,Shen Li,Nikhil Patel,Xing Liu,Xiaodong Wang,Chuanhao Zhuge*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable implementation of context parallelism for recommendation systems using Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU) with jagged tensor support, resulting in improved performance and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling high-cardinality and heterogeneous features in large-scale recommendation systems while improving scalability and handling longer user histories effectively.

Method: The authors enhance the HSTU architecture by incorporating context parallelism (CP) with jagged tensor support to manage and shard activation memory efficiently, enabling longer sequence modeling. The method also combines CP with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP) for added scalability.

Result: The proposed approach enables a 5.3x increase in sequence length for user interaction modeling and achieves a 1.55x scaling factor when combined with DDP.

Conclusion: This work significantly enhances the scalability and efficiency of recommendation systems by providing foundational improvements in handling long sequences and jagged tensor inputs through context parallelism.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume
of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high
cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior
work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an
attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary
streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative
recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that
attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric
improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,
necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In
transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique
that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across
multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In
contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to
represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation
challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor
support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling
up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user
interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when
combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Leakage Impact Score (LIS) as a novel evaluation metric for multimodal recommendation systems and validates its effectiveness through practical deployment and online tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in evaluating alignment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for recommendations, given the limitations of static benchmarks, the high costs of online system evaluations, and insufficient insights from conventional metrics.

Method: The authors propose Leakage Impact Score (LIS) as an efficient metric to measure the upper bound of preference data for multimodal recommendations and provide insights for real-world deployment.

Result: Online A/B tests on Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed showed significant improvements in user engagement metrics like spent time and advertiser value when using the LIS method.

Conclusion: The Leakage Impact Score (LIS) provides an effective solution for evaluating and aligning MLLMs in real-world multimodal recommendation scenarios, enhancing performance and practical deployment strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern
recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are
well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However,
evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant
challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate
because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online
system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3)
conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned
representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the
Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation.
Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound
of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with
LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display
Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and
advertiser value.

*Xiaoxi Cui,Weihai Lu,Yu Tong,Yiheng Li,Zhejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendations by proposing a model (M$^3$BSR) that effectively denoises user interactions and captures diverse user interests, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of sequential recommendations by integrating diverse user behavior patterns and item multimodal information while addressing challenges like behavior-specific modal preferences, implicit feedback noise, and modality noise.

Method: The proposed M$^3$BSR model employs: (1) Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer to remove noise from multimodal representations, (2) Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising Layer to mitigate implicit feedback noise using deep behavioral data, and (3) Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer to model common and specific interests across behaviors and modalities.

Result: M$^3$BSR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods on benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved recommendation accuracy.

Conclusion: The M$^3$BSR effectively addresses key challenges in multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation systems, suggesting its utility in better capturing user preferences and denoising multimodal and behavioral data.

Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to
predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns
with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential
recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper
focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation,
aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective
characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user
attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2)
the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such
as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle
modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the
accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a
novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR).
This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a
Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep
behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data,
thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through
Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a
Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common
and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance
recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets.

### [408] [On the Reliability of Sampling Strategies in Offline Recommender Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05398)
*Bruno L. Pereira,Alan Said,Rodrygo L. T. Santos*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper examines biases in offline evaluations of recommender systems, specifically focusing on exposure and sampling biases. Using a fully observed dataset, the paper evaluates the impact of different sampling and logging choices on evaluation reliability across various dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline evaluations of recommender systems are crucial when online testing is impractical, but they are prone to significant biases such as exposure and sampling biases that can undermine the reliability of model comparisons.

Method: The study uses a fully observed dataset to simulate different exposure biases. It then systematically evaluates common sampling strategies across four dimensions: sampling resolution, fidelity, robustness, and predictive power, to analyze their effects on evaluation reliability.

Result: The analysis reveals when and how sampling strategies distort offline evaluation results. It also identifies the circumstances under which specific strategies are more reliable and robust.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical guidance on selecting sampling strategies that enable more faithful and reliable offline evaluation of recommender systems, highlighting the need to account for and mitigate biases in the process.

Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems
when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two
key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they
are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a
subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has
proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on
fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model
comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user
preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of
logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.
Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate
diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling
strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model
separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability
under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our
findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer
practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust
offline comparisons.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: KuaiLive, a new dataset from Kuaishou, provides extensive live streaming data, enabling dynamic interaction modeling and creating benchmarks for live-streaming recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in academic research caused by the lack of publicly available datasets that reflect the dynamic nature of live streaming environments.

Method: KuaiLive collects real-time interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers, including live room timestamps, multiple interaction types, and rich side features for comprehensive analysis.

Result: The dataset supports a range of live streaming tasks like recommendation ranking and behavioral predictions while enabling fairness-aware and multi-task learning research.

Conclusion: KuaiLive sets a strong benchmark for live streaming research, providing publicly accessible resources that enhance data-driven insights in this domain.

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content
consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and
highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new
challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional
recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in
recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the
lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature
of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the
first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live
streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The
dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over
a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several
advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple
types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich
side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable
more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of
user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from
multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation
methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive
can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K
recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift
price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables
research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware
recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at

*Shiyi Du,Litian Liang,Jiayi Li,Carl Kingsford*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Genomic Language Models (gLMs) face efficiency challenges in handling DNA and RNA modalities. CodonMoE, a lightweight adapter, allows DNA models to analyze RNA tasks efficiently without requiring RNA-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the computational inefficiencies in genomic language models. Existing approaches either require separate specialized models or involve large multi-modal architectures, both of which are computationally expensive.

Method: The proposed solution, CodonMoE, is a lightweight adapter that can transform DNA language models into effective RNA predictors. It acts as a universal approximator for codon-level functions and does not require RNA-specific pretraining.

Result: Experiments across four RNA prediction tasks show that DNA models with CodonMoE outperform standard DNA models. The HyenaDNA+CodonMoE setup achieves state-of-the-art results with 80% fewer parameters compared to specialized RNA models.

Conclusion: CodonMoE provides an efficient and computationally reduced approach to genomic modeling by leveraging existing DNA data while retaining strong RNA-specific performance, bridging the gap between DNA and RNA analysis.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) face a fundamental efficiency challenge:
either maintain separate specialized models for each biological modality (DNA
and RNA) or develop large multi-modal architectures. Both approaches impose
significant computational burdens - modality-specific models require redundant
infrastructure despite inherent biological connections, while multi-modal
architectures demand massive parameter counts and extensive cross-modality
pretraining. To address this limitation, we introduce CodonMoE (Adaptive
Mixture of Codon Reformative Experts), a lightweight adapter that transforms
DNA language models into effective RNA analyzers without RNA-specific
pretraining. Our theoretical analysis establishes CodonMoE as a universal
approximator at the codon level, capable of mapping arbitrary functions from
codon sequences to RNA properties given sufficient expert capacity. Across four
RNA prediction tasks spanning stability, expression, and regulation, DNA models
augmented with CodonMoE significantly outperform their unmodified counterparts,
with HyenaDNA+CodonMoE series achieving state-of-the-art results using 80%
fewer parameters than specialized RNA models. By maintaining sub-quadratic
complexity while achieving superior performance, our approach provides a
principled path toward unifying genomic language modeling, leveraging more
abundant DNA data and reducing computational overhead while preserving
modality-specific performance advantages.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a transcriptomics-based AI framework (GenoMAS) to identify molecular links between diseases, proposing new disease relationships and treatment opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional symptom-based disease classification by identifying molecular commonalities and functional connections between diseases.

Method: The study uses GenoMAS, an agentic AI system, to analyze transcriptomic data across 1300+ disease pairs, developing pathway-based similarity measures through multi-database enrichment analysis.

Result: The study identifies both known and novel disease relationships, explores shared biological mechanisms, and finds therapeutic repurposing opportunities, especially for rare conditions.

Conclusion: The research underscores the utility of AI in scaling transcriptomic analysis, offering mechanistic insights and enabling new perspectives on disease classification and treatment.

Abstract: Modern disease classification often overlooks molecular commonalities hidden
beneath divergent clinical presentations. This study introduces a
transcriptomics-driven framework for discovering disease relationships by
analyzing over 1300 disease-condition pairs using GenoMAS, a fully automated
agentic AI system. Beyond identifying robust gene-level overlaps, we develop a
novel pathway-based similarity framework that integrates multi-database
enrichment analysis to quantify functional convergence across diseases. The
resulting disease similarity network reveals both known comorbidities and
previously undocumented cross-category links. By examining shared biological
pathways, we explore potential molecular mechanisms underlying these
connections-offering functional hypotheses that go beyond symptom-based
taxonomies. We further show how background conditions such as obesity and
hypertension modulate transcriptomic similarity, and identify therapeutic
repurposing opportunities for rare diseases like autism spectrum disorder based
on their molecular proximity to better-characterized conditions. In addition,
this work demonstrates how biologically grounded agentic AI can scale
transcriptomic analysis while enabling mechanistic interpretation across
complex disease landscapes. All results are publicly accessible at

*Tianxiang Hu,Chenyi Zhou,Jiaxiang Liu,Jiongxin Wang,Ruizhe Chen,Haoxiang Xia,Gaoang Wang,Jian Wu,Zuozhu Liu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to improve zero-shot cell type annotation in single-cell RNA-seq data by refining logits using a graph-regularized optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell type annotation for single-cell RNA-seq data is currently labor-intensive and doesn't scale well to large datasets. Existing zero-shot models like LangCell lack consistent accuracy across cell types.

Method: The proposed method incorporates a graph-regularized optimization framework to refine zero-shot logits from LangCell, aligning them using a PCA-based k-NN graph for local consistency.

Result: The method improves zero-shot annotation accuracy by up to 10% when tested on 14 human scRNA-seq datasets, covering over 200,000 cells.

Conclusion: The method is training-free, model-agnostic, and effectively enhances automated annotation, combining scalability with robustness for practical use.

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the
structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by
$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide annotation. While
effective, this process is labor-intensive and does not scale to large
datasets. Recent advances in CLIP-style models offer a promising path toward
automating cell type annotation. By aligning scRNA-seq profiles with natural
language descriptions, models like LangCell enable zero-shot annotation. While
LangCell demonstrates decent zero-shot performance, its predictions remain
suboptimal, particularly in achieving consistent accuracy across all cell
types. In this paper, we propose to refine the zero-shot logits produced by
LangCell through a graph-regularized optimization framework. By enforcing local
consistency over the task-specific PCA-based k-NN graph, our method combines
the scalability of the pre-trained models with the structural robustness relied
upon in expert annotation. We evaluate our approach on 14 annotated human
scRNA-seq datasets from 4 distinct studies, spanning 11 organs and over 200,000
single cells. Our method consistently improves zero-shot annotation accuracy,
achieving accuracy gains of up to 10%. Further analysis showcase the mechanism
by which GRIT effectively propagates correct signals through the graph, pulling
back mislabeled cells toward more accurate predictions. The method is
training-free, model-agnostic, and serves as a simple yet effective plug-in for
enhancing automated cell type annotation in practice.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper explores embedding-based pipelines as an alternative to fine-tuning large DNA language models, achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced inference time and carbon emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of fine-tuning DNA language models in applications with varying data distributions and high computational costs.

Method: The authors propose using embedding extraction pipelines from pre-trained DNA models, followed by lightweight classifiers for prediction tasks.

Result: Embedding-based methods outperform or match fine-tuning in genomic tasks under varied data distributions, reducing inference time (10x to 20x) and carbon emissions (up to 22x).

Conclusion: Embedding extraction provides a scalable, efficient, and generalizable approach to genomic modeling, making it well-suited for diverse genomic contexts.

Abstract: Large pre-trained DNA language models such as DNABERT-2, Nucleotide
Transformer, and HyenaDNA have demonstrated strong performance on various
genomic benchmarks. However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning,
which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution.
In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always
necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed
representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers
can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data
distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while
reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding
extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and
efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or
unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA
embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for
fine-tuning), with an 88% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon
emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification,
DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89
with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2).
These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon
efficiency while maintaining strong predictive performance. The code is

*MD Shaikh Rahman,Feiroz Humayara,Syed Maudud E Rabbi,Muhammad Mahbubur Rashid*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This research addresses challenges in mammographic image retrieval, achieving notable advancements through comprehensive evaluation methods and sophisticated optimization strategies, outperforming traditional benchmarks in precision metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study tackles the demanding task of BIRADS categorical matching for mammographic images, addressing inadequacies in methodology and statistical validation prevalent in existing medical image retrieval studies.

Method: An evaluation framework systematically compared CNN architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) alongside specialized training strategies, employing rigorous data splitting, and bootstrap confidence intervals for statistical validation.

Result: DenseNet121 and ResNet50 achieved precision@10 improvements of approximately 19.6%, and super-ensemble optimization reached 36.33% precision@10, enhancing over 24.93% from baseline, with substantial statistical significance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework sets new benchmarks for 5-class BIRADS matching tasks, offers robust architecture selection guidelines, and establishes potential for clinical applications in diagnostic support and quality assurance.

Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS
categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly
greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in
literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological
limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and
insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN
architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies
including sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble
optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting
(50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic
validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced
fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:
DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,
19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary
architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),
representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases
per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences
between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's
d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds).
Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical
retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents
achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new
performance benchmarks while providing evidence-based architecture selection
guidelines for clinical deployment in diagnostic support and quality assurance
applications.

*Suyi Chen,Haibin Ling*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces cryoGS, a method using Gaussian mixture models for robust cryo-EM reconstruction directly from raw particle images without external initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryo-EM reconstruction methods often require external data for initialization, limiting their integration within self-contained computational pipelines.

Method: The authors developed cryoGS, integrating Gaussian splatting techniques with cryo-EM physics and incorporating innovations like orthogonal projection-aware splatting, normalization terms, and FFT-aligned coordinate systems.

Result: CryoGS demonstrated stable and efficient 3D reconstruction of molecular structures directly from raw cryo-EM data, outperforming existing baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: CryoGS offers a robust, self-contained solution for molecular density reconstruction in cryo-EM applications, paving the way for advancements in structural biology.

Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at
near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM
is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large
collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically
interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained
interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external
consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in
self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a
GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM
image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware
Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and
FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these
innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly
from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental
results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS
over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

*Caner Özer,Patryk Rygiel,Bram de Wilde,İlkay Öksüz,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for medical image quality assessment, leveraging their efficiency and scalability advantages to tackle artifact detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in medical imaging degrade diagnostic accuracy and scalability of classification methods due to high memory demands and preprocessing-related information loss.

Method: The paper introduces INR-based frameworks, specifically deep weight space networks, graph neural networks, and relational attention transformers, for assessing image quality efficiently.

Result: The proposed approach was tested on the ACDC dataset with synthetic artifact patterns, showing effective artifact detection while using fewer model parameters.

Conclusion: INRs offer a scalable and memory-efficient solution for medical image quality assessment, achieving comparable accuracy with lower model complexity.

Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting
diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for
detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods
that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images,
thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we
propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality
assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical
images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while
reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural
networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve
image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with
synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer
parameters.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study evaluates AI models for diagnosing Spitz tumors and compares their performance to experienced pathologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to similarities with conventional melanomas, prompting the search for better diagnostic tools.

Method: AI models analyzing histological and clinical features were developed and tested on a dataset comprising 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas.

Result: The AI model achieved high accuracy (AUROC of 0.95 and accuracy of 0.86) for differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas, and outperformed random guessing for genetic aberration and diagnostic category prediction.

Conclusion: AI models show promise in improving the accuracy of diagnosing Spitz tumors, outperforming pathologists on certain tasks while also enhancing pathology workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical
histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what
extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1)
distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the
underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic
category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a
dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive
performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of
the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a
reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate
the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic
testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on
UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in
differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic
aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly
guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where
random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models
performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not
statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the
simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary
diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and
examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive
performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas.
On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the
diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random
chance.

### [419] [Speech LLMs in Low-Resource Scenarios: Data Volume Requirements and the Impact of Pretraining on High-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05149)
*Seraphina Fong,Marco Matassoni,Alessio Brutti*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The study investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for low-resource speech recognition by integrating a lightweight projector between speech encoders and LLMs and evaluates their effectiveness using public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the potential of Speech LLMs in low-resource settings for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), addressing challenges due to limited data.

Method: SLAM-ASR framework: Connect a speech encoder and LLM using a lightweight trainable projector. Analyze data volume requirements and pretrain projectors using high-resource languages.

Result: Pretrained mono- or multilingual projectors mitigate data scarcity issues. Evaluations using multilingual LLMs demonstrate performance improvements on benchmarks for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Leveraging pretrained projectors and multilingual models enhances the effectiveness of Speech LLMs in low-resource ASR, paving the way for further research in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in handling spoken
inputs for high-resource languages, reaching state-of-the-art performance in
various tasks. However, their applicability is still less explored in
low-resource settings. This work investigates the use of Speech LLMs for
low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition using the SLAM-ASR framework, where a
trainable lightweight projector connects a speech encoder and a LLM. Firstly,
we assess training data volume requirements to match Whisper-only performance,
re-emphasizing the challenges of limited data. Secondly, we show that
leveraging mono- or multilingual projectors pretrained on high-resource
languages reduces the impact of data scarcity, especially with small training
sets. Using multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM, Salamandra) with
whisper-large-v3-turbo, we evaluate performance on several public benchmarks,
providing insights for future research on optimizing Speech LLMs for
low-resource languages and multilinguality.

### [420] [Fairness in Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Understanding Intrinsic Bias in Dysarthric Speech Cloning using F5-TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05102)
*Anuprabha M,Krishna Gurugubelli,Anil Kumar Vuppala*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper investigates the performance and biases of a state-of-the-art speech synthesis model (F5-TTS) in cloning dysarthric speech using the TORGO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in creating assistive technologies for dysarthric speech arise from limited data. Advances in speech synthesis such as zero-shot voice cloning can help but may introduce biases that need evaluation.

Method: The F5-TTS model is analyzed for its ability to synthesize dysarthric speech in terms of intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody. Fairness metrics like Disparate Impact and Parity Difference are used to assess biases across different severity levels.

Result: F5-TTS shows strong bias towards intelligibility at the cost of speaker and prosody preservation when synthesizing dysarthric speech.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the biases of speech synthesis models and highlights the importance of fairness-aware approaches for developing inclusive assistive speech technologies.

Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges in developing assistive
technologies, primarily due to the limited availability of data. Recent
advances in neural speech synthesis, especially zero-shot voice cloning,
facilitate synthetic speech generation for data augmentation; however, they may
introduce biases towards dysarthric speech. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of state-of-the-art F5-TTS in cloning dysarthric speech using
TORGO dataset, focusing on intelligibility, speaker similarity, and prosody
preservation. We also analyze potential biases using fairness metrics like
Disparate Impact and Parity Difference to assess disparities across dysarthric
severity levels. Results show that F5-TTS exhibits a strong bias toward speech
intelligibility over speaker and prosody preservation in dysarthric speech
synthesis. Insights from this study can help integrate fairness-aware
dysarthric speech synthesis, fostering the advancement of more inclusive speech
technologies.

### [421] [Keyword Spotting with Hyper-Matched Filters for Small Footprint Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04857)
*Yael Segal-Feldman,Ann R. Bradlow,Matthew Goldrick,Joseph Keshet*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes a small-footprint model for open-vocabulary keyword spotting using advanced speech and keyword encoders, achieving state-of-the-art detection results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to enable accurate keyword detection in speech, even for new terms not found in training, focusing on efficiency for small devices.

Method: They use a combination of speech and keyword encoders, with a hyper-network that creates keyword-specific convolutional layer weights, integrated with a Perceiver module for keyword detection.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively generalizing to challenging conditions like second-language speech while maintaining small model size.

Conclusion: The proposed system delivers efficient and robust open-vocabulary keyword detection, outperforming larger models and adapting well to new domains.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) refers to the task of detecting words
or terms within speech recordings, regardless of whether they were included in
the training data. This paper introduces an open-vocabulary keyword spotting
model with state-of-the-art detection accuracy for small-footprint devices. The
model is composed of a speech encoder, a target keyword encoder, and a
detection network. The speech encoder is either a tiny Whisper or a tiny
Conformer. The target keyword encoder is implemented as a hyper-network that
takes the desired keyword as a character string and generates a unique set of
weights for a convolutional layer, which can be considered as a
keyword-specific matched filter. The detection network uses the matched-filter
weights to perform a keyword-specific convolution, which guides the
cross-attention mechanism of a Perceiver module in determining whether the
target term appears in the recording. The results indicate that our system
achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain conditions, including second-language (L2) speech. Notably, our
smallest model, with just 4.2 million parameters, matches or outperforms models
that are several times larger, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.
